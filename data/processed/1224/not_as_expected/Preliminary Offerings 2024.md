required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “EU PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling

### INEOS Finance plc

#### € % Senior Secured Notes due 2029 $ % Senior Secured Notes due 2029


**Guaranteed on a senior secured basis by**
**INEOS Group Holdings S.A., INEOS Luxembourg I S.A., INEOS Holdings Limited**
**and certain of their subsidiaries**

INEOS Finance plc (the “Issuer”) is offering (the “Offering”) € aggregate principal amount of its euro-denominated
% Senior Secured Notes due 2029 (the “Euro Notes”) and $ aggregate principal amount of its dollar-denominated %
Senior Secured Notes due 2029 (the “Dollar Notes” and, together with the Euro Notes, the “Notes”). Interest on the Notes will accrue
from, 2024 and be payable semi-annually in arrear on and of each year, beginning, 2024.
The Notes will mature on, 2029. Some or all of the Notes may be redeemed prior to, 2026, by
paying 100% of the principal amount of such Notes plus a “make-whole” premium, and at any time on or after, 2026, at
the redemption prices set forth in this offering memorandum. In addition, at any time on or prior to, 2026, we may redeem
up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of each of the Euro Notes and the Dollar Notes with the net proceeds of certain equity
offerings at % of the principal amount of the Euro Notes or at % of the principal amount of the Dollar Notes, as applicable,
plus accrued interest, if at least 50% of the Euro Notes or Dollar Notes, as applicable, remain outstanding.
Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a “change of control,” each holder of the Notes may require the Issuer
to repurchase all or a portion of its Notes. All of the Notes may also be redeemed at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued
interest if at any time the Issuer or any Guarantor (as defined below) becomes obligated to pay withholding taxes as a result of certain
changes in law.
The Notes will be the Issuer’s senior secured obligations and will, (i) upon issuance, (a) rank pari passu in right of payment
with all of the Issuer’s existing and future indebtedness that is not subordinated to the Notes; and (b) be guaranteed by INEOS Group
Holdings S.A. (the “Parent”), INEOS Luxembourg I S.A. (“Lux I”), INEOS Holdings Limited and certain of their subsidiaries on a
senior secured basis (together, the “Initial Guarantors”) and (ii) within 90 days after the Issue Date (subject to certain approvals and
security principles) be guaranteed by certain of the Company’s other subsidiaries (the “Subsequent Guarantors” and, together with
the Initial Guarantors, the “Guarantors”). Upon issuance or within 90 days after issuance, the Notes and the guarantees will be secured
by first-ranking liens (subject to certain exceptions) on the same assets that secure the Existing Senior Secured Notes and the Senior
Secured Term Loans as more fully described in “Description of the Collateral and the Guarantees” and elsewhere in this offering
memorandum.
This offering memorandum includes more detailed information on the terms of the Notes, the guarantees and the security
interests as briefly described above, including redemption and repurchase prices, security, covenants and transfer restrictions and,
therefore, this offering memorandum should be read as a whole by any prospective purchaser in making a determination as to whether
to invest in the Notes.
Currently there is no public market for the Notes. Application will be made to list the Notes on the Official List of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange and for trading on the Euro MTF market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (the “Euro MTF
**Market”). There is no assurance that the Notes will be listed and admitted to trading on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock**
Exchange. The Euro MTF Market is not a regulated market pursuant to the provisions of Directive 2014/65/EC on markets in financial
instruments, as amended. The Euro MTF Market falls within the scope of Regulation (EC) 596/2014 on market abuse and
Directive 2014/57/EU on criminal sanctions for market abuse.
**Investing in the Notes involves risks that are described in the “Risk Factors” section beginning on**
**page 27 of this offering memorandum.**


**Offering price for the Euro Notes:** **% plus accrued interest from the issue date, if any.**
**Offering price for the Dollar Notes:** **% plus accrued interest from the issue date, if any.**
**The Notes and the guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the**
**“Securities Act”), or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Notes may be offered only in transactions that are**
**exempt from registration under the Securities Act and the laws of any other relevant jurisdiction. The Notes are being offered and sold**
**only to (i) qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act and (ii) non-U.S. persons outside the United States**
**in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. For further details about eligible offerees and resale restrictions, please see “Notice**
**to Investors.”**
We expect that delivery of the Euro Notes will be made to investors in book-entry form through Euroclear Bank SA/NV
(“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking S.A. (“Clearstream”) and the Dollar Notes are expected to be delivered to investors in bookentry form through The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), in each case, on or about, 2023. Interests in each global note will
be exchangeable for the relevant definitive Notes only in certain limited circumstances. See “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form.”

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND NON-IFRS INFORMATION**

**Financial Information**

The consolidated financial information of INEOS Group Holdings S.A. included elsewhere in this
offering memorandum as of and for each of the years ended December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021, and
December 31, 2020 have been extracted from the audited consolidated financial statements of INEOS Group
Holdings S.A. as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 (“2022 Audited Consolidated Financial
**Statements”), from the audited consolidated financial statements of INEOS Group Holdings S.A. as of**
and for the year ended December 31, 2021 (“2021 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements”) and from the
audited consolidated financial statements of INEOS Group Holdings S.A. as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2020 (“2020 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements”). The 2022 Audited Consolidated
Financial Statements, together with the 2021 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the 2020
Audited Consolidated Financial Statements, are referred to as the “Audited Consolidated Financial
**Statements.” The Audited Consolidated Financial Statements have been audited by Deloitte Audit, Société**
_à responsabilité limitée. The Audited Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance_
with IFRS (as defined herein).

During 2022, the Group has re-presented receipts from derivative contracts of €257.8 million for
the year ended December 31, 2021 and €0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 which were
previously presented as cash flows from investing activities, and are now shown net of payments on derivative
contracts within interest paid and other finance items under cash flows from financing activities in the
consolidated statement of cash flows of the 2022 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result,
the financial line items “Net cash used in investing activities” and “Net cash from/(used in) financing
activities” in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are
extracted from the unaudited comparative information included in the 2022 Audited Consolidated Financial
Statements.

The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of INEOS Group Holdings
S.A. included elsewhere in this offering memorandum as of September 30, 2023 and for the three- and
nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, including unaudited comparative interim financial information
for the three- and nine-month period ended September 30, 2022, have been prepared in accordance with
IAS 34, the standard of IFRS applicable to interim financial statements (as defined herein) (the “Unaudited
**Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” and, together with the Audited Consolidated**
Financial Statements, the “Consolidated Financial Statements”). For a complete description of the
accounting principles applied in preparing INEOS Group Holdings S.A.’s audited consolidated financial
statements and unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements, please see, respectively, note 1,
“Accounting Policies” to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and note 2, “Principal Accounting
Policies” to the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included
elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

The unaudited financial information for the 12 months ended September 30, 2023 is based on the
Consolidated Financial Statements and has been prepared by subtracting the unaudited financial
information of INEOS Group Holdings S.A. for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 extracted
from the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements from the corresponding
financial information of INEOS Group Holdings S.A. for the year ended December 31, 2022 extracted
from the 2022 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and then adding the corresponding unaudited
financial information of INEOS Group Holdings S.A. for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023
extracted from the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

The unaudited financial information for the 12 months ended September 30, 2023 has not been
prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the Securities Act, the EU Prospectus
Regulation, the UK Prospectus Regulation or any generally accepted accounting standards. Such financial
data has not been audited or reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted auditing or review
standards. INEOS Group Holdings S.A.’s unaudited financial information for the 12 months ended
September 30, 2023 has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of our
results of operations for any future period and is not prepared in the ordinary course of our financial
reporting. The unaudited financial information for the 12 months ended September 30, 2023 are non-IFRS
financial measures.

This offering memorandum also includes certain unaudited consolidated financial information that
has been adjusted to give pro forma effect to the Post-Q3 Transactions and the Transactions as if they had
taken place, with respect to unaudited pro forma net debt, on September 30, 2023, and to give pro forma effect


-----

to the Transactions as if they had taken place, with respect to unaudited pro forma cash interest expense, on
October 1, 2022. The unaudited consolidated pro forma financial information has been prepared for
illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what the actual consolidated financial position
would have been if the Post-Q3 Transactions and the Transactions had occurred on September 30, 2023,
with respect to the unaudited pro forma net debt, or if the Transactions had occurred on October 1, 2022 with
respect to unaudited pro forma cash interest expense, nor does it purport to project our consolidated
financial position or performance at any future date. The unaudited pro forma financial information set
forth in this offering memorandum is based on available information and certain assumptions and estimates
that we believe are reasonable but may differ from the actual amounts. The unaudited pro forma financial
information has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X Article 11 under
the Securities Act, the EU Prospectus Regulation or the UK Prospectus Regulation or any generally
accepted accounting standards. Neither the assumptions underlying the adjustments nor the resulting
adjusted financial information have been audited in accordance with any generally accepted auditing
standards.

The Group financial statements have been prepared using accounting policies that are consistent
with those of the previous financial year. The Group has re-presented receipts from derivative contracts of
€257.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and €0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020
which are now shown net of payments on derivative contracts within interest paid and other finance items
in the consolidated statement of cash flows.

**Use of Non-IFRS Financial Measures**

We have presented certain information in this offering memorandum based on non-IFRS measures,
including net cash interest expense, total indebtedness and net debt as well as EBITDA-based measures. We
define the following non-IFRS financial measures as follows:

     - Net cash interest expense comprises interest payable on senior notes (i.e., the 2024 IGH Notes
issued by IGH, which were redeemed in full on November 9, 2021, and the senior secured notes
issued by the Issuer), interest payable on bank loans and overdrafts and interest payable on
securitization, less interest income on bank balances, as follows:

    - Total indebtedness represents gross long-term interest-bearing loans and borrowings plus gross
short-term interest-bearing loans and borrowings before deduction of unamortized debt issuance
costs. Under IFRS, debt issuance costs are deducted from the related debt amounts for the
purposes of balance sheet presentation and are amortized over the life of the debt. Total
indebtedness excludes lease obligations, which are included in a separate line item on the balance
sheet.

     - Net debt represents total indebtedness less cash and cash equivalents.

A reconciliation of total financial indebtedness to net debt as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and
2020 and September 30, 2023 is presented in the table below:

EBITDA before exceptionals is the EBITDA-based financial measure that is utilized in this
offering memorandum:

     - EBITDA before exceptionals represents profit for the period before net finance costs or income,
tax charges or credits, depreciation, amortization and impairment, share of profit/(loss) of
associates and joint ventures using the equity accounting method, profit or loss on disposal of
investments, profit or loss on disposal of fixed assets, and exceptional items as defined in the
Consolidated Financial Statements, which can vary year over year. In accordance with IFRS, we
use both the first-in first-out (“FIFO”) and weighted average cost methods of accounting for
purposes of determining our inventory cost in connection with the preparation of our audited
annual consolidated financial statements. EBITDA before exceptionals is based on the FIFO and
weighted average cost methods of accounting for inventory used in connection with the
preparation of such financial statements. EBITDA before exceptionals is derived from income
statement line items calculated in accordance with IFRS on a historical cost basis.

The reconciliation of INEOS’s EBITDA before exceptionals to profit for the period is as follows:

**For the nine-month** **For the**
**period ended** **12-month period**

**For the year ended December 31,** **September 30,** **ended September 30,**

These EBITDA-based measures are non-IFRS measures. We believe that the presentation of
EBITDA-based measures enhances an investor’s understanding of our financial performance. However,
EBITDA-based measures should not be considered in isolation or viewed as a substitute for operating profit,
profit, cash flows from operating activities or other measures of performance as defined by IFRS. These
EBITDA-based measures, as used herein, are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions
of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation. Our management has used,
and expects to use, EBITDA-based measures to assess operating performance and to make decisions
about allocating resources among our various segments. In assessing our overall performance and the
performance of each of our segments, management reviews EBITDA-based measures as a general indicator
of performance compared to prior periods. Furthermore, management and employee bonuses can be
linked to the EBITDA-based performance of the business and the region in which they work. Our EBITDAbased measures exclude items that management does not consider in assessing operating performance.
Our management believes it is useful to eliminate such items because it allows management to focus on what
it considers to be a more meaningful indicator of operating performance and ability to generate cash flow
from operations.

EBITDA before exceptionals differs from Consolidated EBITDA, as presented in the “Description
of the Notes,” which is on a pre-IFRS 16-basis and includes certain cost savings as defined in the definition
therein.

The information presented by the EBITDA-based measures is unaudited and has not been
prepared in accordance with IFRS or any other accounting standards. In addition, the presentation of this
measure is not intended to and does not comply with the reporting requirements of the SEC; compliance
with its requirements would require us to make changes to the presentation of this information.

**Overview**

We are one of the world’s largest chemical companies as measured by revenue. Our business has
highly integrated world class chemical facilities and production technologies. We have leading global market
positions for a majority of our key products and a strong and stable customer base. We currently operate
34 manufacturing sites in seven countries throughout the world. We are led by a highly experienced
management team with, on a combined basis, over 100 years of experience in the chemical industry. As of
September 30, 2023, our total chemical production capacity was approximately 25,000 kta, of which 57% was
in Europe and 43% was in North America.

We operate our business through three segments: Olefins & Polymers Europe, Olefins & Polymers
North America and Chemical Intermediates. The products we manufacture are derived from crude oil and
natural gas, and include olefins, polymers and various petrochemical products directly or indirectly derived
from olefins. Our products serve a broad and diverse range of end markets, including packaging,
construction, automotive, white goods/durables, agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals.

Our highly integrated, world class production facilities and technological know-how allow us to
process raw materials into higher value-added products. In Europe, we own two sites integrated with
crackers and polymer units. Typically, these two sites account for approximately 76% of our European
olefin and polymer volumes. The polyolefins plants on our two major sites in Europe normally receive more
than 95% of their feedstock supply from our integrated crackers. Following the completion of the Lavéra
Acquisition, we will also own the Naphtachimie steam cracker, which is one of Europe’s largest with a
capacity of 720 ktpa of ethylene. This cracker is integrated with the downstream derivative plants which make
up the Lavéra Businesses. Similarly, in the United States, much of our olefin feedstock requirements for
our polymer business is supplied by either our Chocolate Bayou cracker in Texas or by integrated third-party
facilities, such as the Tesoro facility in Carson, California. The Bayport Acquisition site in Bayport, Texas,
USA is also integrated with third-party facilities. We believe that with our highly integrated facilities we are
able to capture attractive margins across the value chain, enjoy greater certainty of feedstock supply,
reduce logistical costs, improve energy management and optimize our product slate.

We benefit from the cost advantages of operating large scale, well invested, highly integrated
facilities strategically located near major transportation facilities and customer locations. Since January 1,
2007, we and our predecessors have invested approximately €12 billion (including investments in divested
assets) in our production facilities to ensure that they operate efficiently, resulting in integrated, and state
of the art production units. This includes significant investments of almost €3.6 billion in the last five years
to further enhance our assets’ capabilities. We believe these investments allow us to operate at lower cost
and higher utilization rates than most of our competitors, and enable us to maintain positive margin and cash
flows even during downturns in industry cycles or customer demand. For the 12-month period ended
September 30, 2023, our revenue was €15.5 billion and our EBITDA before exceptionals was €1.6 billion.

Over the past several years, we have implemented a range of strategic initiatives designed to lower
our operating costs, increase our profitability and further enhance our market position. These include fixed
asset investments to expand our capacity in higher value products, to enhance productivity at our existing
facilities, and to reduce our fixed cost structure through headcount reductions, production line closures and
system upgrades. In addition, we have shifted our product portfolio to focus on more differentiated
products, exited low-margin businesses and implemented premium pricing strategies designed to improve
our margins. We believe these initiatives provide us with a strong platform to drive growth, create significant
operating leverage and position us to benefit from volume recovery in our end markets.

Since April 1998, when INEOS was established with the acquisition of the Belgian “Oxide” assets
from Inspec plc, we have significantly expanded, both through a series of strategic acquisitions of businesses


-----

and assets from major chemical companies, and through organic growth. The combination of INEOS and
Innovene in December 2005 represented a transformational milestone for our company, providing global
scale and further upstream integration.

In 2011, we transferred our Refining Business, our Entrepreneurial (Refining) Business and certain
infrastructure assets to three joint ventures outside the INEOS Group. Please see “Business—Refining
Divestiture, Grangemouth Divestiture and Lavéra Divestiture—The Refining Divestiture” for a further
description of the disposal of our Refining Business and Entrepreneurial (Refining) Business.

In 2013, we completed the Grangemouth Divestiture to a newly created subsidiary of INEOS
Holdings AG, our indirect parent company. See “Business—Refining Divestiture, Grangemouth Divestiture
and Lavéra Divestiture—The Grangemouth Divestiture.”

In 2014, we divested the olefins and polymers assets and Chemical Intermediates assets of the
Lavéra site. See “Business—Refining Divestiture, Grangemouth Divestiture and Lavéra Divestiture—The
Lavéra Divestiture.”

In 2015, we completed the purchase of the remaining 50% interest in the Noretyl ethylene cracker
at Rafnes, Norway from the INOVYN group (formerly the Kerling Group), a related party. In 2015, we
also acquired aromatics and cumene assets from Axiall Corporation. The acquisition comprised the world’s
largest cumene plant in Pasadena, Texas. In addition, Axiall’s phenol, acetone and alpha-methylstyrene
business was transferred to the INEOS phenol facility at Mobile, Alabama.

In 2016, the Group acquired 100% of the shares of WLP Holding Corporation, one of the largest
high density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe manufacturers in North America. Moreover, in 2016, following a
strategic review of the INEOS Technologies business, we decided to cease marketing its polyolefins licensing
technology externally and to transfer the remaining parts of the INEOS Technologies business to existing
businesses within the Group to provide a clearer focus on individual product lines.

In 2019, the Group acquired the INESCO combined heat and power plant at the Antwerp site in
Belgium.

In December 2020, the Group acquired the remaining 50% interest in the Gemini HDPE joint
venture from Sasol Chemicals. The principal activity of the company is the production of high density
polyethylene in La Porte, Texas, United States. The acquisition increased the Group’s interest in Gemini to
100% through Unrestricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the Indentures and the Senior Secured Term Loans
Agreement). Prior to the acquisition the Group reflected its 50% interest in Gemini as a joint venture. A
Restricted Subsidiary (as defined in the Indentures and the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement) of the
Group is the operator of the facility and has the exclusive right to supply Gemini with the required
components necessary for the production of a specified quantity of the HDPE products and to take such
quantity of the HDPE products and, as compensation, pays a toll fee. See “Description of Other
Indebtedness—Gemini HDPE Term Loans.”

In December 2021, the Group acquired the assets of Charter Plastics in Titusville, United States, a
manufacturer of high density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe products.

In the summer of 2022, the Group began construction of a new ethane steam cracker in Antwerp,
Belgium, for the production of ethylene with a nameplate capacity of approximately 1,450 kta, along with
associated utilities, tankage and infrastructure (“Project ONE”). We believe Project ONE is the largest
investment in the European chemicals industry for the past 20 years and we expect it to be among the most
efficient and sustainable of its kind. It is planned to be equipped with the best available technologies with
a high efficiency in use of raw materials and energy, CO2 emissions that are expected to be less than half of
the currently best performing similar units in Europe from the outset and a clear path to carbon neutrality
on a Scope 1 and Scope 2 basis within 10 years of start-up of the cracker. See also “Other Recent
Developments,” “Risk Factors—Future acquisitions or developments—Any future acquisitions or
developments may prove difficult for us to consummate,” “Risk Factors—Litigation—We are subject to

“Business—Facilities—Project ONE.”

In December 2022, the Group acquired for approximately RMB 10.5 billion, through an
Unrestricted Subsidiary, a 50% interest in the Shanghai SECCO Petrochemical Company Limited facility
in Shanghai, China (“SECCO”). The remaining 50% is owned by Sinopec and its affiliates. SECCO has a
capacity of 4,200 kta of petrochemicals, including ethylene, propylene, polyethylene, polypropylene, styrene,


-----

polystyrene, acrylonitrile, butadiene, benzene and toluene. In August 2023, the Group acquired, through an
Unrestricted Subsidiary, 50% interest in a joint venture with Sinopec which now holds a new petrochemical
complex in Tianjin, China currently under construction by Sinopec (the “Tianjin Nangang Ethylene Project”).
The Tianjin Nangang Ethylene Project is expected to be on-stream in the second half of 2024 and includes
a new 500 kta HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene) plant.

On March 31, 2023, the Group completed the acquisition of the entire asset base of Mitsui
Phenols Singapore Ltd from Mitsui Chemicals for a total consideration of $273.0 million, which was
funded by cash on hand. The acquisition comprised the entire asset base of Mitsui Phenols on Jurong
Island, Singapore, which has more than 1,000 ktpa of capacity, including for cumene, phenol, acetone, alphamethylstyrene and bisphenol A. This acquisition allows us to support our global customers more effectively,
developing new markets and relationships in Asia.

In July 2023, affiliates of the Group announced their intention to acquire TotalEnergies’ 50% share
of Naphtachimie (720 ktpa steamcracker), Appryl (300 ktpa polypropylene business), Gexaro (270 ktpa
aromatics business) and 3TC (naphtha storage), currently 50:50 joint ventures between TotalEnergies and
the Lavéra Businesses. The acquisition includes other infrastructure assets associated with the site, including
full ownership of the southern sections of TotalEnergies’ ethylene pipeline network running from Lavéra
to the Lyon region. A 50% share of the central and northern sections, from the Lyon region to the Lorraine
region, will be held equally TotalEnergies and an affiliate of the Group. A binding sale and purchase
agreement (subject to customary conditions to completion) was signed in October 2023. The Group will,
immediately prior to the acquisition of the TotalEnergies Lavéra Business, complete the Lavéra
Reorganization, following which the acquisition of the TotalEnergies Lavéra Business will occur within the
Group. The Lavéra Acquisition is subject to regulatory approval and satisfaction of other customary
closing conditions and is expected to be completed in the first half of 2024.

In December 2023, the Group agreed with LyondellBasell to acquire its Ethylene Oxide and
Derivatives business, including the Bayport Underwood site in Texas, USA for $700 million, which includes
a 420 kt Ethylene Oxide plant, a 375 kt Ethylene Glycols plant, a 165 kt Glycol Ethers plant and all
associated third-party activities on the site. The Bayport Acquisition is expected to be completed in the
second quarter of 2024, subject to regulatory and other third-party approvals and satisfaction of other
customary closing conditions.

- Merchant market sales

(1) The assets of INEOS Chemicals Grangemouth Limited and INEOS Commercial Services UK Limited were transferred
out of IGH on October 1, 2013 in connection with the Grangemouth Divestiture, and the Lavéra Divestiture assets
were transferred out of IGH on July 1, 2014; therefore, their capacity has been excluded from the full-year capacity
figures. However, for the estimation of market ranking for IGH their capacities have been included since these assets
remain within the broader INEOS family of companies and there has been no restriction to, or change in, the competitive
dynamic that the assets exercise within the European market as a part of the INEOS family of companies. Therefore,
in management’s view, it is helpful to consider the Grangemouth and Lavéra assets in order to reflect the relative overall
commercial strength of the INEOS family of companies, which is the same as that of O&P Europe within IGH.
Following completion of the Lavéra Acquisition, the capacity of the Lavéra Businesses (and the TotalEnergies Lavéra
Business) will form part of the Group, increasing the Group’s capacity by 3,770 ktpa.

(2) Following completion of the Bayport Acquisition, our capacity of ethylene oxide will increase by 420 ktpa, giving us a
#2 market position in the U.S. and improving our market position globally to #4.

_Olefins & Polymers Europe and Olefins & Polymers North America_

In our olefins and polymers businesses, we produce olefins, other cracker products, such as
butadiene and benzene, and a broad range of polyolefin polymers. We are among the largest producers of
olefins and polymers in the world. The focus of our olefins business in Europe and North America is on
ethylene and propylene, which are the two largest volume olefins globally and are key building blocks for
polymers. The olefins we make are primarily used as feedstock for our derivatives businesses. In addition, we


-----

sell olefins to third-party customers for a variety of industrial and consumer applications, including the
manufacture of plastics, rubber and fiber. In our polymers business, we focus on polyethylene and
polypropylene.

We operate a total of 19 sites for olefins and polyolefins, including our large integrated olefins
cracker and polyolefin facilities at Köln, Germany, Rafnes, Norway, and Chocolate Bayou, Texas, United
States and nine polyethylene pipe manufacturing sites within the United States. These facilities support our
highly competitive proprietary polyolefin process technologies. The technologies include our cost-effective
gas phase polypropylene technology, our specialized technology for high-density polyethylene and our flexible
proprietary “swing” technology for both linear low-density and high-density polyethylene.

The North American and European markets for olefins and polyolefins are quite distinct, with
separate pricing structures and distribution channels. As a result, each market may experience different
rates of growth and levels of return. Therefore, we operate these two businesses separately and report them
as two distinct segments—INEOS Olefins & Polymers Europe and INEOS Olefins & Polymers North
America. For the 12-month period ended September 30, 2023, our Olefins & Polymers Europe and Olefins &
Polymers North America businesses contributed €6.5 billion and €4.3 billion of revenue (excluding
intersegmental eliminations) and €338.2 million and €746.6 million of EBITDA before exceptionals,
respectively (including, in each case, intersegmental eliminations).

We are also focused on expanding our presence in Asia with the development of a number of joint
ventures with Sinopec in China (See “Business—Olefins & Polymers Asia”).

_Chemical Intermediates_

Chemical intermediates are higher-value-added chemical products used as key components in a
wide variety of consumer and industrial products. In our Chemical Intermediates business, we utilize
olefins as key raw materials and produce a wide range of products, including phenol, acetone, alpha olefins,
ethylene oxide and derivatives, acrylonitrile, ammonia and nitriles.

We have four main product groups within our Chemical Intermediates business: INEOS Nitriles,
INEOS Oligomers, INEOS Oxide and INEOS Phenol. We have a total of 17 manufacturing sites globally,
with many of our plants integrated either directly with their key raw materials on-site, or integrated via
pipeline connection.

We are the world’s leading producer of phenol, which is an essential starting material for a wide
range of applications in the electrical/electronics, automotive, construction and household/furniture
industries. Our main product in the nitriles sector is acrylonitrile, which is used in the production of acrylic
fibers and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastic. We are also among the largest volume suppliers of
linear and poly alpha olefins in the world. According to NexantECA, we are the second largest producer of
ethylene oxide in Western Europe. We have a range of associated products, including ethylene glycol,
propylene oxide, propylene glycol and acetate esters. We manufacture and supply high-quality catalysts and
additives in support of various technologies to major companies around the world, and also to our own
manufacturing assets. For the 12-month period ended September 30, 2023, our Chemical Intermediates
revenue and EBITDA before exceptionals were €7.1 billion and €540.9 million, respectively, excluding
intersegmental eliminations.

**Our Competitive Strengths**

We believe that the factors set forth below provide us with a competitive advantage in the markets
in which we compete:

    - Diversified Portfolio of Businesses Serving a Broad Range of End Markets. We are one of the
world’s largest chemical companies. We operate 34 manufacturing sites in seven countries around
the world. These assets have a total production capacity of approximately 25,000 kta as of
September 30, 2023. We believe we have a top 5 or better global or regional market position in
12 of our key products.

Our petrochemical products are utilized in a wide range of end-market applications. The
following diagram sets forth our petrochemicals revenue by end use application in 2022.

We believe that such application and market diversity reduces the effect of industry cyclicality on
our results. In addition, we believe that we benefit from the fact that the supply and demand
dynamics of the cycles relating to our petrochemical products are fairly independent, which helps
mitigate some of the cyclicality in the industry.

- Vertically Integrated, World-Scale Producer. We have three large-scale petrochemical sites,
accounting for approximately 39% of our total petrochemical production capacity as of
September 30, 2023. Each of these sites is integrated with a major cracker and/or polymers and
derivatives unit.

We operate one of the largest single-site ethylene oxide/ethylene glycol plants in Europe and the
two largest phenol plants in Europe, one of which is the largest in the world, as well as the largest
single train phenol plant in North America. We operate the largest acrylonitrile facility in the
world and one of the largest high-density polyethylene complexes in North America. We believe
that our existing plants have sufficient capacity such that as our production volumes increase, we
will be able to leverage our fixed cost base and increase our profitability.

Our sites are typically located near raw materials, refineries and associated pipeline infrastructure.
We believe our highly integrated facilities provide us with the ability to capture margins across
the value chain, enjoy certainty of feedstock supply (particularly for ethylene), reduce logistical
costs, improve energy management, adjust the product slate to capture greater value (by selling


-----

olefins or, alternatively, by using them internally in the production of polymers or derivatives)
and reduce our exposure to margin volatility as a result of changes in raw material prices. We
operate large plants that permit us to spread fixed costs over large volumes of production, thereby
reducing unit costs and enhancing profits.

- Access to Advantaged Feedstocks. Our Chocolate Bayou cracker installation in the United
States uses natural gas liquids-based feedstocks, such as ethane, as its main feedstocks. This allows
us to benefit from the current low-cost supply of ethane resulting from the growth in the supply
of shale gas in the United States. Ethane is also a lower-cost feedstock than naphtha in Europe,
where we operate a very efficient gas olefin cracker in Rafnes. In 2019, our butane storage tank
contract was signed to provide the largest ever built in Europe. The tank came on stream in the
Port of Antwerp, Belgium in October 2020. Our other olefin cracker in Europe, at Köln, is a
naphtha cracker, but it has significant gas cracking flexibility. Our ability to use lower-cost
feedstocks, like ethane and butane, gives us an advantage over our competitors with crackers that
cannot accept such a significant mix of gas feedstocks, and must rely on more expensive
naphtha. The gas cracking flexibility has been enhanced further with expanded butane supply to
our cracker in Köln supported by four Rhine river barges. Contracts for supply of four Rhine
river barges were signed in 2018 with delivery of three in 2020 and the fourth delivery in 2021. In
the summer of 2022, we began construction of Project ONE, a new ethane steam cracker in
Antwerp, Belgium for the production of ethylene. We believe it is the largest investment in the
European chemicals industry for the past 20 years and we expect it to be among the most efficient
and sustainable of its kind.

In addition, our Chocolate Bayou cracker and our naphtha crackers in Europe can also use
naphtha as a feedstock, allowing us to manage our feedstock mix in response to changes in
economic and market conditions and maximize our margins. Our fleet of eight long-term chartered
Dragon class ships and four VLEC vessels, together with the expanded gas storage terminal in
Rafnes, a deep water terminal near Philadelphia and long-term supply contracts, provides us
access to the attractive U.S. ethane market for our gas-based cracker in Rafnes, Norway.

- Well-Invested, Highly Efficient Production Facilities. Our large, well-invested plants benefit
from economies of scale and favorable locations. Our acquisition activity has focused on acquiring
businesses that complement our existing manufacturing facilities with well-invested physical
assets from major chemical companies. In addition, each year we continue to invest in improving
and expanding our facilities. Since January 1, 2007, we and our predecessors have invested
approximately €12 billion (including investments in divested assets) in our production facilities
to ensure that they operate efficiently, resulting in integrated, and state-of-the-art production units.
This includes significant investments of almost €3.6 billion in the last five years to further
enhance our assets’ capabilities.

- Extensive Portfolio of Leading Proprietary Technologies. We have a broad portfolio of
proprietary manufacturing technologies which we use for the manufacturing of our key products.
We believe that they enable us to be one of the lowest cost producers and provide us with a
significant competitive advantage in terms of product quality, and we continue to improve the
portfolio through focused research and technology investments.

- Experienced Management Team with a Strong Track Record. Our senior management team has
been operating INEOS and our predecessors for over 20 years and has a demonstrated track
record of achieving profitable growth in the chemical industry, successfully integrating large
acquisitions, dramatically reducing the fixed cost base, and deleveraging the business following
such acquisitions. James A. Ratcliffe, our controlling shareholder, and the other existing
shareholders have a successful record of investing in the chemical industry. Across the wider
INEOS group, including our ultimate parent company and its other subsidiaries, we have
completed 42 significant acquisitions since the formation of INEOS in 1998. Each of these
acquisitions has been integrated effectively and we have been able to achieve significant costsavings in the acquired businesses. Our management team has extensive experience in the chemical
industry, including working for leading companies such as ICI, DuPont, Dow, Degussa and BP,
and a proven ability to increase productivity, reduce costs and control capital expenditures and
working capital. We believe the experience of our management team is a distinct competitive
advantage.

In addition, our senior management team has demonstrated the ability to streamline our
businesses by focusing on core competencies and disposing of non-core or underperforming


-----

businesses. In the past 12 years, we have disposed of several non-core or underperforming
businesses. We disposed of the Refining Business and the Entrepreneurial (Refining) Business in
July 2011. On October 1, 2013, we completed the Grangemouth Divestiture to a newly created
subsidiary of INEOS Holdings AG, our indirect parent company. See “Business—Refining
Divestiture, Grangemouth Divestiture and Lavéra Divestiture—The Grangemouth Divestiture.”
The disposal of these businesses has enabled us to focus management time on core activities,
reduce our capital expenditure requirements going forward and also reduce our exposure to
underperforming cash consuming businesses. On July 1, 2014, the Group also completed the
Lavéra Divestiture to a new subsidiary of INEOS AG, the ultimate parent company of the Group
at the time of the divestiture. See “Business—Refining Divestiture, Grangemouth Divestiture
and Lavéra Divestiture—The Lavéra Divestiture.” The Lavéra Acquisition will bring the Lavéra
Businesses back into the Group, now with full ownership and control and without the limitations
of a joint venture, which we believe will allow us to unlock greater value in the assets.

**Our Business Strategy**

In response to challenges resulting from the current macroeconomic environment and as part of
our long-term strategic aim, we have maintained and will continue to execute a strategy consisting of the
following short- and long-term elements. These are designed to help us improve our capital structure, leverage
our key strengths and market opportunities and ensure ongoing cash flow generation and growth:

    - Where and When Appropriate, and within the Confines of Our Capital Structure, to Pursue
**_Long-term Value-added Growth Opportunities._** As a result of our lean corporate structure, we
are able to maintain a level of agility that few organizations our size are able to match. We have a
highly disciplined evaluation process and a detailed series of metrics by which we measure the
value creation prospects of potential projects. Opportunities for profitable growth are identified
and vetted in an efficient, non-bureaucratic format, which, in many cases, we believe enables us to
establish a first-mover advantage. For example, we continued to pursue opportunities to grow
our assets in the U.S. through the expansion of our Chocolate Bayou cracker in 2020, and, also
in 2020, acquired the remaining 50% of the high-density polyethylene plant at our Battleground
site in Texas from Sasol Limited. Our O&P Europe business also has in place 15-year supply
and infrastructure agreements entered into in 2012 to access ethane feedstock from the United
States for use in its European cracker complexes. In 2020, we opened a new 420 kta linear alpha
olefins plant and, in 2022, we opened a new 120 kta poly alpha olefins plant, both at Chocolate
Bayou, Texas. In the summer of 2022, we began construction of our 1,450 kta ethane steam
cracker for the production of ethylene in Antwerp, Belgium. In addition, we are currently pursuing
several other projects that we believe provide opportunities for profitable growth. We are
particularly focused on expanding our footprint in Asia to further access the high demand
growth of that region, which may take the form of joint ventures and Unrestricted Subsidiaries.
For example, in 2022, we acquired a 50% interest in the SECCO facility in China and, in 2023, we
acquired a 50% stake in the Tianjin Nangang Ethylene Project, currently under construction by
Sinopec, which is expected to be on-stream in the second half of 2024 and includes a new 500 kta
HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene) plant, in each case through an Unrestricted Subsidiary. On
March 31, 2023, the Group completed the acquisition of the entire asset base of Mitsui Phenols
Singapore Ltd from Mitsui Chemicals. The acquisition comprised the entire asset base of
Mitsui Phenols on Jurong Island, Singapore, which has more than 1,000 ktpa of capacity,
including for cumene, phenol, acetone, alpha-methylstyrene and bisphenol A. This acquisition
provides us with additional capacity to support our global customers more effectively, developing
new markets and relationships in Asia. In 2023, we agreed with LyondellBasell to acquire its
Ethylene Oxide and Derivatives business, including the Bayport Underwood site in Texas, USA,
which includes a 420 kt Ethylene Oxide plant, a 375 kt Ethylene Glycols plant, a 165 kt Glycol
Ethers plant, and associated third-party activities on the site (expected to be completed in the
second quarter of 2024). The acquisition will expand our Ethylene Oxide & Derivatives business
into the US, which is the world’s largest market, with what we believe are well-run and best-inclass assets. It also complements our existing Ethanolamines production facility in Plaquemine,
Louisiana. In addition, there is free land on the Bayport Underwood site for INEOS’ growth
aspirations and it is an ideal location to develop our third-party business supporting customers
to co-locate and integrate into an existing Ethylene Oxide & Derivatives platform. In July 2023,
affiliates of the Group announced their intention to acquire TotalEnergies’ 50% share of
Naphtachimie (720 ktpa steamcracker), Appryl (300 ktpa polypropylene business), Gexaro (270
ktpa aromatics business) and 3TC (naphtha storage), currently 50:50 joint ventures between


-----

TotalEnergies and the Lavéra Businesses. The acquisition includes other infrastructure assets
associated with the site, including full ownership of the southern sections of TotalEnergies’
ethylene pipeline network running from Lavéra to the Lyon region. The Group will, immediately
prior to the acquisition of the TotalEnergies Lavéra Business, complete the Lavéra Reorganization,
following which the acquisition of the TotalEnergies Lavéra Business will occur within the
Group. The Lavéra Acquisition is subject to regulatory approval and satisfaction of other
customary closing conditions and is expected to be completed in the first half of 2024. The Lavéra
Acquisition will allow us to fully integrate the Lavéra assets and enhance the competitiveness of
our offer, and gives us direct access to the complete ethylene production from the Naphtachimie
cracker for the Group’s internal use and third party customers.

- Continue to Drive Sustainability as a Fundamental Part of Our Business. We believe we are a
leader in driving sustainable practices across our industry as evidenced by our 2023 Sustainalytics
rating which placed us as 11th best (11th lowest risk) of 576 chemical companies so far assessed,
and 4th best out of 273 commodity chemical companies. Our sustainability strategy is to
develop and safely manufacture the products needed to address the evolving challenges of climate
change, public health, resource scarcity, urbanization and waste in a way which drives us all
towards a Net Zero Emission Economy by 2050 while remaining profitable. We believe our Health,
Safety, Security and Environmental (“HSSE”) performance is industry leading. Our strategy is
to continue to improve injury incidence metrics and environmental compliance ratings by applying
increasingly sophisticated methodologies, with the ultimate aim being to achieve zero accidents.
We seek to ensure that all employees receive appropriate training, thereby enabling them to
effectively contribute to HSSE performance and HSSE improvement processes. It is our policy
to design our processes and manufacture and distribute our products in a responsible manner so
that our employees, customers, the public and the environment are protected to the extent
practicable from avoidable risks. Our businesses have put in place roadmaps to lead the transition
to a Net Zero Economy in our industry by no later than 2050, while remaining profitable, and
staying ahead of evolving regulations and legislation. Based on these roadmaps, we are setting
ambitious but achievable targets for 2030 which are in line with our 2050 commitment. Our target
is to reduce greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions by 33% (as compared to 2019) on a like-for-like
basis by no later than 2030. This target is consistent with EU and other national GHG emissions
reduction targets. In the near term, we are investing over €6 billion on projects which will
reduce our emissions footprint. We are also investing in new products and technologies to drive
the industry to a circular economy in which materials are re-used to the maximum extent, and no
products, once used, enter the natural environment. For example, we have committed to make
all our products recyclable and, by 2025, to develop a range of polyolefin products containing at
least 50% recycled product. Overall, across wider INEOS (including entities outside of the
Group), we have committed to achieving 850 kt of recycled or bio content in our polymers by
2030, which is consistent with anticipated regulatory recycled-content targets in Europe.

- Generate Cost Savings and Enhance Efficiency. We have historically succeeded in reducing costs
at our acquired businesses by making rapid reductions in underlying fixed costs and implementing
an efficient corporate and management structure. We have achieved significant fixed cost
reductions in businesses that we have acquired, delivering on average a reduction of 20% of
inherited fixed costs in the four-year period post acquisition. Continuous improvements in the
efficiency of our existing sites and opportunities for site consolidation are key aspects of this
strategy, as we seek to maintain upper quartile cost positions and world-scale facilities across the
majority of our operations. The control of fixed costs will continue to be a key priority for our
business.

- Generate Strong Cash Flow. We intend to continue our focus on cash flow generation by
maximizing the utilization of assets, leveraging existing resources, continuously improving
working capital practices, following disciplined and focused capital expenditure and cost reduction
plans and optimizing where possible our capital structure. This focus has allowed us to reduce
our costs and improve our cash flow management, such as the ability to implement lower levels
of maintenance capital expenditure. We apply the cash flows generated from these initiatives to
help reduce our debt and to strategically invest in the business.

- Maximize Utilization of Assets. As a low-cost focused producer, we believe in operating our
facilities at full capacity. We believe this allows us to maintain positive margins and cash flows,
even during downturns in industry cycles or customer demand, more readily than some of our
competitors who have higher production costs. We intend to achieve growth in production volume


-----

by improving utilization rates within the defined availability of an asset, improving availability
of an asset by minimizing planned and unplanned facility downtime and improving capacity of an
asset through de-bottlenecking projects. We have a strong track record of improving utilization
rates of acquired assets.

    - Maintain a Lean Corporate Structure and Incentivize Employees. We intend to operate our
business in a manner that is consistent with the philosophy of our shareholders and maintain a
simple and decentralized, flat organizational structure that minimizes corporate bureaucracy,
coupled with compensation arrangements that incentivize our employees. We believe that a
simple and decentralized organizational structure is cost-effective and will allow each of our
management teams the freedom to use their industry knowledge to respond to market
opportunities. We believe that we can increase the value of our business when our employees
share in the value they create. We have management and employee bonuses and long-term
incentive plans linked to the EBITDA before exceptionals performance and other factors of the
business in which they work.

    - Maximize Flexibility to Use Advantaged Feedstocks. We remain focused on our strategy of
acquiring advantaged feedstock sources and improving our flexibility to use different feedstocks
to take advantage of changing market conditions. In 2017, we entered into an agreement to
construct one of the largest butane tanks in Europe. In 2019, our butane storage tank contract
was signed to provide the largest ever built in Europe. The tank came on stream in the Port of
Antwerp, Belgium in October 2020 and allows us to import butane from the United States (and
from all over the world) to supply material to our naphtha crackers at Köln. This project
complements our contracts signed in 2012 and 2015 to source ethane directly from the United
States for our Rafnes cracker as well as our a new ethane import tank and new ethane furnace at
our Norwegian plant. The gas cracking flexibility has been enhanced further with expanded
butane supply to our cracker in Köln supported by four Rhine river barges, which were delivered
in 2020 and 2021. We are also committed to maintaining flexibility in feedstock while expanding
our olefins capacity. For example, our Chocolate Bayou plant predominantly uses liquid based
natural gas as feedstock, but has the ability to process naphtha and our Köln plant is capable
of switching between naphtha and butane as a feedstock. This enables us to manage our feedstock
mix in line with changing market and economic conditions. To further enhance our sourcing of
advantaged feedstock, we began construction of a new ethane steam cracker in Antwerp, Belgium,
referred to as Project ONE, for the production of ethylene in the summer of 2022. We believe it
is the largest investment in the European chemicals industry for the past 20 years and we expect it
to be among the most efficient and sustainable of its kind.

2025 Senior Secured Notes, (iii) the €325.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3[3]∕8% March 2026 Senior Secured Notes and
(iv) the €770.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2[7]∕8% May 2026 Senior Secured Notes.
(7) Non-guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries include, among others, Noretyl AS, the borrower of the Rafnes Facility, and the Project
ONE subsidiaries. The Rafnes Facility is guaranteed by IGH and the Project ONE Facilities are, during the construction phase,
supported by a debt service undertaking provided by IGH, IHL and INEOS US I Inc. The Group entered into the Project ONE
Facilities in December 2022 to borrow loans of up to €3.5 billion to fund the majority of the Project ONE capital expenditure
plus associated financing costs during construction. The Project ONE Facilities will be drawn in stages, throughout the construction
period. To date, €522.0 million has been drawn under the Project ONE Facilities. On July 20, 2023, the Group received a
decision from the Council for Permit Disputes annulling the permit for Project ONE. As a result of the annulment of the permit,
further drawings were suspended from that date. On January 7, 2024, a new permit was reissued. We expect the drawstop to be
lifted on or around February 22, 2024, the date that is 45 days after the permit was reinstated. In September 2023, the Group entered
into the Project ONE Interim Facility. This is a short dated facility repayable within 364 days. During the nine-month period
ending September 30, 2023 the Group made drawdowns under the Project ONE Interim Facility of €85.0 million and paid debt
issue costs of €2.0 million. The Group expects to repay the Project ONE Interim Facility from the original Project ONE Facilities
following lifting of the drawstop under the Project ONE Facilities. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Rafnes Facility”
and “Description of Other Indebtedness—Project ONE Facilities.”
(8) Refers to the Senior Secured Term Loans borrowed under the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement, dated as of April 27, 2012
and as amended, restated, supplemented and varied from time to time, among INEOS Finance plc and INEOS US Finance
LLC, as borrowers, certain subsidiaries of IGH, Barclays Bank PLC and certain lenders. We expect, on or about the Issue Date,
to draw additional New Senior Secured Term Loans in an aggregate principal amount of € million and $ million under
the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement. See “The Transactions.”
(9) Unrestricted Subsidiaries held directly or indirectly by IHL. INEOS Real Estate GmbH & Co. KG is an Unrestricted Subsidiary
(as defined in “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions”) of Lux I, which owns an office building in Köln, Germany.

**RECENT DEVELOPMENTS**

**Q4, 2023 Trading Statement**

Based on management’s preliminary analysis and certain estimates, management estimates that
EBITDA before exceptionals for the three-month period ended December 31, 2023 was approximately 15%
higher compared to EBITDA before exceptionals of €392 million for the corresponding period in 2022
and approximately 12% higher compared to EBITDA before exceptionals of €403 million for the three-month
period ended September 30, 2023.

Management estimates that EBITDA before exceptionals for the full year ended December 31,
2023 was approximately 41% lower compared to EBITDA before exceptionals of €2,841 million for the
year ended December 31, 2022. Elevated inflation and interest rates, together with continued high energy
costs in Europe have led to reduced demand levels and weak margins. North American markets were relatively
robust, taking full benefit from their current cost advantage. Market conditions in Europe and Asia have
remained weak in the quarter. Nevertheless, the business saw an improving trend in performance throughout
the quarter.

Management estimates that EBITDA before exceptionals for O&P North America for the
three-month period ended December 31, 2023 was approximately 15% lower compared to EBITDA before
exceptionals of €176 million for the corresponding period in 2022. Management estimates that EBITDA
before exceptionals for the full year ended December 31, 2023 was approximately 40% lower compared to
EBITDA before exceptionals of €1,204 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Ethylene markets were
generally subdued in the quarter with lower demand, improved industry supply availability and reduced
export opportunities. Polymer markets were soft with some erosion of margins for most products in the
quarter, although downstream pipe markets remained solid.

Management estimates that EBITDA before exceptionals for O&P Europe for the three-month
period ended December 31, 2023 was approximately 99% higher compared to EBITDA before exceptionals
of €74 million for the corresponding period in 2022. Management estimates that EBITDA before
exceptionals for the full year ended December 31, 2023 was approximately 37% lower compared to EBITDA
before exceptionals of €656 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Markets for olefins in the
quarter were generally weak with most industry crackers being trimmed across Europe. Propylene markets
were soft with weak demand across most derivatives due to high energy costs. European polymer markets
were relatively stable but continue to be subdued on overall low demand.

Management estimates that EBITDA before exceptionals for Chemical Intermediates for the
three-month period ended December 31, 2023 was approximately 9% higher compared to EBITDA before
exceptionals of €142 million for the corresponding period in 2022. Management estimates that EBITDA
before exceptionals for the full year ended December 31, 2023 was approximately 44% lower compared to
EBITDA before exceptionals of €981 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Overall demand in the
Oligomers business was solid across the product portfolio, although there was some softness in comonomers. There was modest demand improvement across most market sectors for the Oxide business,
however European glycol markets remained weak. Demand for the Nitriles business was mixed, with balanced
demand in the USA, but softer demand in Europe due to high energy costs, and Asia due to improved
industry supply. Markets for the Phenol business were firm in the USA, but weaker in Europe and Asia.

Management estimates that net debt (including the Rain Facility, the Project ONE Facilities and
the Project ONE Interim Facility) at the end of December 2023 was approximately 37% higher compared
to net debt of €6,239 million at the end of December 2022. Management estimates that cash balances at the
end of December 2023 were approximately 33% lower compared to €2,639 million at the end of
December 2022. Management estimates that net debt leverage (excluding the Rain Facilities, the Project
ONE Facilities and the Project ONE Interim Facility) was approximately 4.0 times EBITDA before
exceptionals as at December 31, 2023.

**Other Recent Developments**

**Bayport Acquisition**

In December 2023, the Group agreed with LyondellBasell to acquire its Ethylene Oxide and
Derivatives business, including the Bayport Underwood site in Texas, USA for $700 million, which includes
a 420 kt Ethylene Oxide plant, which will have just completed a major turnaround prior to completion of
the acquisition, a 375 kt Ethylene Glycols plant, a 165 kt Glycol Ethers plant and all associated third-party
activities on the site. The Bayport Acquisition adds significant capacity to our operations in the U.S. and
transforms our oxides business from a European business to a global one. The Bayport Acquisition is expected
to be completed in the second quarter of 2024, subject to regulatory and other third-party approvals and
satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. The purchase price for the Bayport Acquisition is intended
to be financed with the proceeds from the Offering.

The Bayport Acquisition will form part of our Chemical Intermediates segment. In evaluating the
Bayport Acquisition and the purchase price thereof, INEOS considered an average EBITDA over a cyclical
period from 2018 to 2022 of an estimated $85 million. During the period EBITDA ranged from an
estimated high of $185.9 million in 2018 to an estimated low of ($5.9) million in 2020. These EBITDA
figures were derived from management accounts and not from audited financial data.

**Lavéra Acquisition**

In July 2023, affiliates of the Group announced their intention to acquire to acquire TotalEnergies’
50% share of Naphtachimie (720 ktpa steamcracker), Appryl (300 ktpa polypropylene business), Gexaro
(270 ktpa aromatics business) and 3TC (naphtha storage), currently 50:50 joint ventures between
TotalEnergies and the Lavéra Businesses, at Lavéra in the south of France (the target assets being collectively
the “TotalEnergies Lavéra Business”). The acquisition also includes other infrastructure assets associated
with the site, including full ownership of the southern sections of TotalEnergies’ ethylene pipeline network
running from Lavéra to the Lyon region. A 50% share of the central and northern sections of the pipeline,
from the Lyon region to the Lorraine region, will be held equally by TotalEnergies and an affiliate of the
Group. A binding sale and purchase agreement (subject to customary conditions to completion) was signed
in October 2023. The Group will, immediately prior to the acquisition of the TotalEnergies Lavéra
Business, complete the Lavéra Reorganization, following which the acquisition of the TotalEnergies Lavéra


-----

Business will occur within the Group. The Lavéra Acquisition will bring the Lavéra Businesses back into
the Group, now with full ownership and control and without the limitations of a joint venture, which we
believe will allow us to unlock greater value in the assets. The Lavéra Acquisition is subject to regulatory
approval and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions and is expected to be completed in the
first half of 2024. The purchase price for the Lavéra Acquisition will be approximately €400 million in
aggregate. This is intended to be financed with the proceeds from the Offering.

The Lavéra Acquisition will form part of our Olefins and Polymers Europe and Chemical
Intermediates segments. In evaluating the Lavéra Acquisition and the purchase price thereof, INEOS
considered an average EBITDA over a cyclical period from 2016 to 2022 of an estimated €227 million.
During the period EBITDA ranged from an estimated high of €355.8 million in 2017 to an estimated low
of €117.7 million in 2018. These EBITDA figures were derived from management accounts and not from
audited financial data.

**Project ONE Permit Application**

On July 20, 2023, INEOS Olefins Belgium (IOB), a Restricted Subsidiary of the Group, received a
decision from the Council for Permit Disputes in Flanders annulling the permit for Project ONE, the
ethane cracker designed to be the most efficient and sustainable cracker currently in Europe, which IOB is
building in the Port of Antwerp with a nameplate capacity of 1450kt of ethylene per year. As a result of the
annulment, all construction on the Project ONE site in the Port of Antwerp had to be suspended. Works
on Project ONE in other locations (for example in module yards around the world) have, however, continued
during this period.

The Council ruled, amongst other things, that the so-called “appropriate assessment” of Project
ONE, assessing the extent of any effects of the project on special areas of conservation (which formed part
of IOB’s permit application) had not been examined by the Flemish Government based on the concrete
facts of the case; and that the appropriate assessment did not sufficiently substantiate that the nitrogenbased depositions of Project ONE will not have significant effects on the Brabantse Wal Special Protection
Area, located in the province of Noord Brabant, Netherlands.

In its decision, the Council ordered the Flemish Government to take a new decision within
six months from the day after the day of notification of the judgment. On August 18, 2023, IOB filed a
“cassation” appeal to the Council of State against the ruling of the Council for Permit Disputes. As yet, no
hearing date has been set for that appeal.

Separately, on October 4, 2023, IOB submitted an amended permit application for Project ONE
containing an updated assessment on relevant protected nature sites and species. Other parts of the permit
application remained as per the original application. The updated appropriate assessment (approximately 800
pages) aimed to address the ruling of the Council for Permit Disputes, analyzing the project in detail in
relation to individual habitat types and individual species in relevant protected areas.

On January 7, 2024, following completion of the required procedural process, a new permit was
issued for Project ONE by the Flemish Minister for Justice and Enforcement, Environment and Spatial
Development and Energy and Tourism. The permit is immediately effective from the date of issue.
Construction works on the Project ONE site in the Port of Antwerp have now resumed.

**Post-Q3 Transactions**

In December 2023, the Group declared a dividend of €697.5 million payable to its immediate
parent, INEOS Holdings Luxembourg S.A., of which €250.0 million was paid in cash.

In December 2023, the Group extended the maturity date of the Securitization Program to
December 2026.

The above-mentioned dividend and the extension of the Securitization Program are referred to
herein as the “Post-Q3 Transactions”.

Notes. In some jurisdictions, the security documents creating the
existing first-ranking liens securing the Senior Secured Term Loans,
the 2028 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured
Notes, the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes and the 2025 Senior
Secured Notes will be amended to extend such liens (or, with respect
to Belgian security, to confirm that these liens extend) to the
Notes (or, with respect to French and certain of the German security
interests, junior ranking security interests will be granted). The
existing first-ranking liens securing the Senior Secured Term Loans,
the 2028 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured
Notes, the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes and the 2025 Senior
Secured Notes that were created under English law, Scottish law,
Jersey law and Singapore law will remain in place, and new liens
over the same Collateral will be created in these jurisdictions to
secure the Notes. In these jurisdictions where new liens are created,
the ranking of these new liens relative to the existing liens will, as
a matter of general law, depend on a number of factors, such as the
nature of the liens, the order of creation of the liens, compliance
with the jurisdiction’s perfection requirements with respect to the
liens and the order of giving notices with respect to the liens, and
accordingly without the Intercreditor Deed, the new liens would
be likely to rank after the existing liens. However, the Intercreditor
Deed provides that, as a contractual matter, the liens securing the
Notes, the 2028 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior
Secured Notes, the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the 2025
Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Term Loans will rank
_pari passu and will be treated as having equal priority with respect_


-----

to the application of proceeds from the enforcement of any
Collateral. See “Description of the Collateral and the Guarantees.”

The liens on the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Term
Loans, the 2028 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured
Notes, the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes and the 2025 Senior
Secured Notes are already in place and will continue to remain in
place and will either be amended to extend the security to the
Notes, or, as mentioned above, new junior ranking liens will be
created.

In addition, the Intercreditor Deed will provide that a simple
majority in aggregate amount of all senior secured debt (including
the Notes, any additional Notes, certain hedging obligations, certain
cash management obligations, the Senior Secured Term Loans, the
2028 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the
March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the 2025 Senior Secured Notes
and any other senior secured notes or credit facilities that are
permitted to be issued under the Indenture and that the trustees or
lenders in respect thereof accede to the Intercreditor Deed) under the
Intercreditor Deed can instruct the Security Trustee with respect
to enforcement of the security. For a description of security
enforcement and other intercreditor provisions, please see
“Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Deed.”

**Additional Amounts . . . . . . . . .** All payments paid by or on behalf of the Issuer, any Guarantor or
any surviving entity under or with respect to the Notes or any
guarantee under the Notes will be made free and clear of, and
without withholding or deduction for or on account of, any present
or future tax, duty, levy, impost, assessment, withholding or other
governmental charges (including, without limitation, penalties,
interest and other similar liabilities related thereto) of whatever
nature (collectively, “Taxes”), unless such withholding or deduction
is required by law or by the interpretation or administration of
law, or by an applicable certification, identification, information or
other reporting requirement or agreement, if entering into or
complying with such requirement or agreement is required by law
of a taxing authority therein or political subdivision thereof as a
precondition to relief or exemption from such Tax. If any amount
for, or on account of Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of
any jurisdiction in which the Issuer, any Guarantor or, if applicable,
any surviving entity is incorporated, organized or otherwise
subject to Tax or from or through which any of the foregoing
makes any payment on the Notes or by any taxing authority therein
or political subdivision thereof, is required to be withheld or
deducted from any payment made under or with respect to the
Notes or any guarantee, the Issuer, Guarantor or surviving entity,
as the case may be, will pay such additional amounts as may be
necessary to ensure that the net amount received after such
withholding or deduction will be not less than the amount that
would have been received if such Taxes had not been required to be
withheld or deducted, subject to certain exceptions. See “Description
of the Notes—Payment of Additional Amounts.”

**Optional Redemption of Notes . .** Prior to, 2026, the Issuer may redeem all or a
portion of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of such Notes plus the applicable “make-whole”
premium set forth in this offering memorandum, plus accrued and
unpaid interest to the redemption date.

On or after, 2026, the Issuer may redeem all or a
portion of the Notes at the redemption prices set forth in this offering


-----

memorandum under the caption “Description of the Notes—
Optional Redemption” plus accrued and unpaid interest to the
redemption date.

In addition, at any time prior to, 2026, the Issuer
may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the
Notes with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at a
redemption price equal to % of the aggregate principal amount
of the Euro Notes or % of the aggregate principal amount of
the Dollar Notes, as applicable, plus accrued and unpaid interest to,
but not including, the redemption date; provided that at least 50%
of the sum of the originally issued aggregate principal amount of the
Notes of the applicable series and the initial aggregate principal
amount of any Additional Notes of such series issued under the
Indenture after the Issue Date remains outstanding immediately
after each such redemption and each such redemption occurs within
180 days after the date of the relevant equity offering.

In connection with any tender offer, or other offer to purchase, all
of the Notes, if holders of not less than 90% of the Notes tender
their Notes and such Notes are purchased, the Issuer may redeem
all (but not less than all) of the Notes that remain outstanding. Such
purchase may be made at a price equal to the highest price paid to
each other holder in such tender offer plus accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the
redemption date. Please see “Description of the Notes—Optional
Redemption.”

**Optional Redemption for Taxation**
**Reasons . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** In the event of certain developments affecting taxation, the Issuer
may redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes at 100% of the
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts (as defined in “Description of the Notes—
Payment of Additional Amounts”), if any, to the date of redemption.
Please see “Description of the Notes—Redemption upon Changes
in Withholding Taxes.”

**Change of Control . . . . . . . . . .** Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a “change of
control,” the Issuer is required to offer to repurchase all outstanding
Notes at a purchase price in cash of 101% of the principal amount
thereof on the date of purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, to the date of purchase. See “Description of the Notes—
Purchase of Notes upon a Change of Control.”

**Certain Covenants . . . . . . . . . .** The Indenture will contain covenants that, among other things,
limit the ability of Lux I and its restricted subsidiaries to:

                        - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain
preferred stock;

                        - make restricted payments, including dividends or other

                        - prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity;

                        - make certain investments;

                        - create or permit to exist certain liens;

                        - transfer, lease or sell certain assets;

                        - enter into arrangements that impose restrictions on the ability
of our restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other
payments to Lux I;

                        - engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

                        - consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our
assets and the assets of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis;

                        - impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of
the Notes; and

                        - amend certain documents.

Each of these covenants is subject to a number of important
limitations and exceptions as described under “Description of the
Notes—Certain Covenants.”

**Transfer Restrictions . . . . . . . . .** The Notes and the guarantees have not been, and will not be,
registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any
other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold, except pursuant
to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the
registration requirements of the Securities Act. We have not agreed
to, or otherwise undertaken to, register the Notes (including by
way of an exchange offer).

**Use of Proceeds . . . . . . . . . . . .** The proceeds from the sale of the Notes will be used as set forth in
“Use of Proceeds.”

**No Established Market for the**
**Notes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes will be new securities for which there is no existing
market. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid market for
the Notes will develop or be maintained.

**Listing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Application will be made to list the Notes on the Official List of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange, and to have the Notes admitted to
trading on the Euro MTF Market. The Euro MTF Market is not a
regulated market for purposes of MIFID II.

**SUMMARY HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

The following tables present the summary consolidated financial information and other financial
information of INEOS Group Holdings S.A. as of and for each of the years ended December 31, 2022,
2021 and 2020, which have been extracted from the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements, included
elsewhere in this offering memorandum. The Audited Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared in
accordance with IFRS and have been audited by Deloitte Audit, Société à responsabilité limitée.

During 2022, the Group has re-presented receipts from derivative contracts of €257.8 million for the
year ended December 31, 2021 and €0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 which were previously
presented as cash flows from investing activities, and are now shown net of payments on derivative
contracts within interest paid and other finance items under cash flows from financing activities in the
consolidated statement of cash flows of the 2022 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result,
the financial line items “Net cash used in investing activities” and “Net cash from/(used in) financing
activities” in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are
extracted from the unaudited comparative information included in the 2022 Audited Consolidated Financial
Statements.

In addition, the following tables also present the summary unaudited condensed consolidated
interim financial information and other financial information of INEOS Group Holdings S.A. as of
September 30, 2023 and for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022,
which have been extracted from the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
included elsewhere in this offering memorandum, unless otherwise indicated. The Unaudited Interim
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34, the standard
of IFRS applicable to interim financial statements.

The unaudited financial information for the 12 months ended September 30, 2023 is based on the
Consolidated Financial Statements and has been prepared by subtracting the unaudited financial
information of INEOS Group Holdings S.A. for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 extracted
from the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements from the corresponding
financial information of INEOS Group Holdings S.A. for the year ended December 31, 2022 extracted
from the 2022 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and then adding the corresponding unaudited
financial information of INEOS Group Holdings S.A. for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023
extracted from the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

The unaudited financial information for the 12 months ended September 30, 2023 has not been
prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the Securities Act, the EU Prospectus
Regulation, the UK Prospectus Regulation or any generally accepted accounting standards. Such financial
information has not been audited or reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted auditing standards.
INEOS Group Holdings S.A.’s unaudited financial information for the 12 months ended September 30, 2023
has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of our results of operations
for any future period and is not prepared in the ordinary course of our financial reporting. The unaudited
financial information for the 12 months ended September 30, 2023 are non-IFRS financial measures.

The tables below also include certain unaudited consolidated financial information that has been
adjusted to give pro forma effect to the Post-Q3 Transactions and the Transactions, as if they had taken
place, with respect to unaudited pro forma net debt, on September 30, 2023, and to give pro forma effect to
the Transactions, as if they had taken place, with respect to unaudited pro forma net cash interest expense, on
October 1, 2022. The unaudited consolidated pro forma financial information has been prepared for
illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what the actual consolidated financial position
would have been if the Post-Q3 Transactions and the Transactions had taken place on September 30,
2023, with respect to unaudited pro forma net debt, or if the Transactions had taken place on October 1,
2022, with respect to unaudited pro forma cash interest expense, nor does it purport to project our consolidated
financial position at any future date. The unaudited pro forma financial information set forth in this
offering memorandum is based on available information and certain assumptions and estimates that we
believe are reasonable but may differ from the actual amounts.

You should read the information summarized below in conjunction with the information contained
in “Presentation of Financial and Non-IFRS Information,” “Use of Proceeds,” “Capitalization,” “Operating
and Financial Review and Prospects,” and the consolidated financial statements and the related notes to
the financial statements of INEOS Group Holdings S.A. included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

(1) Working capital represents net current assets (current assets less current liabilities).

(2) Total interest-bearing loans and borrowings represents net loans and borrowings after deducting debt issuance costs as presented
in note 18 to each of the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and note 10 to the Unaudited Interim Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

(3) Total indebtedness represents gross long-term interest-bearing loans and borrowings plus gross short-term interest-bearing loans
and borrowings before deduction of unamortized debt issuance costs. Under IFRS, debt issuance costs are deducted from the
related debt amounts for the purposes of balance sheet presentation and are amortized over the life of the debt. See “Presentation
of Financial and Non-IFRS Information.”

(4) Net debt represents total indebtedness less cash and cash equivalents. See “Presentation of Financial and Non-IFRS Information.”

(5) EBITDA before exceptionals represents profit for the period before net finance costs or income, tax charges or credits, depreciation,
amortization and impairment, share of profit/(loss) of associates and joint ventures using the equity accounting method, profit/
(loss) on disposal of investments, profit/(loss) on disposal of fixed assets, and exceptional items as defined in the Consolidated
Financial Statements. In accordance with IFRS, we use both the FIFO and weighted average cost methods of accounting for
purposes of determining our inventory cost in connection with the preparation of our audited annual consolidated financial
statements. EBITDA before exceptionals is based on the FIFO and weighted average cost methods of accounting for inventory used
in connection with the preparation of such financial statements. EBITDA before exceptionals is derived from income statement
line items calculated in accordance with IFRS on a historical cost basis. Although our EBITDA-based measures should not be
considered a substitute measure for operating profit, profit, cash flows from operating activities or other measures of
performance as defined by IFRS, we believe that they provide useful information regarding our ability to meet future debt service
requirements. The EBITDA-based measure presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other
companies. See “Presentation of Financial and Non-IFRS Information—Use of Non-IFRS Financial Information.” EBITDA
before exceptionals includes the impact of IFRS 16 Leases. Excluding the impact of IFRS 16 Leases (of €241.2 million, reflecting
€180.8 million in respect of the payment of the capital element of lease liabilities and €60.4 million in respect of interest expense
payable on lease liabilities for the 12-month period ended September 30, 2023), our EBITDA before exceptionals for the 12-month
period ended September 30, 2023 is €1,384.5 million. See “Presentation of Financial and Non-IFRS Information.”
(6) Net cash interest expense comprises interest payable on senior notes, interest payable on bank loans and overdrafts and interest
payable on securitization, less interest income on bank balances (2022: €27.0 million, 2021: €1.0 million, 2020: €2.5 million,
nine-month period ended September 30, 2023: €61.3 million, nine-month period ended September 30, 2022: €10.0 million, 12-month
period ended September 30, 2023: €78.3 million). See “Presentation of Financial and Non-IFRS Information.”
(7) Capital expenditures represents payments to acquire property, plant and equipment as recorded on the consolidated cash flow
statements for the periods indicated.

(8) _Pro forma net debt represents total indebtedness less cash and cash equivalents giving pro forma effect to the Post-Q3 Transactions_
and the Transactions. We assume a different acceptance rate in each Tender Offer, which is presented herein solely for illustrative
purposes. The actual amounts accepted in each Tender Offer may vary substantially. Pro forma net debt does not include lease
liabilities (which are recognized as indebtedness under IFRS 16 Leases) of €1,144.2 million (composed of current lease liabilities
of €183.7 million and non-current lease liabilities of €960.5 million) as of September 30, 2023. Pro forma net debt also excludes
(i) the Rain Facilities, entered into in December 2022 by our Unrestricted Subsidiary INEOS China Holdings Limited, with an
aggregate principal amount of RMB 1,045 million and $785 million and guaranteed by IHL and IGH, (ii) the Project ONE
Facilities, entered into in December 2022, which provide for an aggregate principal amount of up to €3.5 billion with a current
amount outstanding of €522 million and (iii) the Project ONE Interim Facility, which provides for an aggregate principal
amount of up to €400 million with a current amount outstanding of €85 million. We expect the Project ONE Facilities to continue
to be drawn in stages, beginning in the first quarter of 2023 and throughout the Project ONE construction period to 2026. See
“Description of Other Indebtedness—Rain Facilities”, “Description of Other Indebtedness—Project ONE Facilities” and
“Description of Other Indebtedness—Project ONE Interim Facility.”

(9) Gives pro forma effect to the Post-Q3 Transactions and the Transactions as if they had taken place, with respect to unaudited
_pro forma net debt, on September 30, 2023, and gives pro forma effect to the Transactions as if they had taken place, with respect_
to unaudited pro forma net cash interest expense, on October 1, 2022. For presentational purposes, euro equivalents of dollardenominated indebtedness have been converted using an exchange rate of $1.0563 per €1.00, which is the exchange rate used for
our balance sheet as of September 30, 2023. The Bloomberg Composite Rate on January 26, 2024, was $1.0853 per €1.00. The ratio
of pro forma net debt including the Rain Facilities, the Project ONE Facilities and the Project ONE Interim Facility to EBITDA
before exceptionals is 5.8x. The ratio of pro forma net debt excluding the Rain Facilities, the Project ONE Facilities and the
Project ONE Interim Facility to EBITDA before exceptionals excluding the impact of IFRS 16 Leases would be 5.7x. Including
the Rain Facilities, the Project ONE Facilities and the Project ONE Interim Facilities the ratio of pro forma net debt to EBITDA

**RISK FACTORS**

**Risks Relating to Our Businesses and Industries**

**_Cyclicality of the petrochemical industry—Changing market demands and prices may negatively affect our_**
**_operating margins and impair our cash flows, which, in turn, could affect our ability to make payments on our_**
**_debt or to make further investments in our businesses._**

Cyclicality and volatility in supply and demand in the petrochemical industry may affect our prices
and may negatively impact our operating margins and cash flows and cause us to incur losses. For example,
the recent decline in industry margins has adversely affected our business, results of operations and
cashflows. A decline to fourth quarter of 2008 or second quarter of 2020 margin levels, or further, or
prolonged periods of low margins, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations
and cash flow. Any cyclical downturn may affect our prices and may negatively impact our operating
margins and cash flows and cause us to incur losses. Furthermore, increased volatility in industry margins
could have a significant impact on our short-term results. In such cases, we would have to absorb any losses
or borrow additional funds. If we experience significant margin volatility or if we incur losses over a
prolonged period and are unable to obtain additional funds, our liquidity could be materially adversely
affected and our ability to make debt payments could be impaired.

The relationship between supply and demand in the petrochemical industry in general, and in our
various petrochemical segments historically, has been highly cyclical. This is primarily because product
supply is driven by alternating periods of substantial capacity additions and periods in which no or limited
capacity is added. Historically, the markets for some of our products have tended to follow trends in economic
growth and have experienced alternating periods of constrained supply, causing prices and margins to
increase, followed by periods of capacity additions, resulting in oversupply and declining prices and margins.
In response, companies typically reduce capacity or limit further capacity additions, eventually causing the
market to be relatively undersupplied. Any slowdown in growth for any reason could have a disproportionately
negative effect on industry margins for our petrochemical products. For a discussion of the current market
environment, see “Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—Overview—Key Factors Affecting Our
Results of Operations,” “Industry and Market Overview—Olefins & Polyolefins—Market Environment”
and “Industry and Market Overview—Chemical Intermediates—Market Environment.”

Historically, margins in the petrochemical industry have been volatile due to a number of factors,
most of which are beyond our control. These factors include:

    - short-term utilization rate fluctuations due to planned and unplanned plant outages;

     - political and economic conditions, which drive rapid changes in prices for our key feedstocks,
including the price of crude oil, gas and naphtha;

    - customers’ inventory management policies; and

     - exchange rate fluctuations.

In addition, we and other petrochemical companies with large asset bases in Europe face pressures
due to the fact that many of our key customers in Europe are subject to competition with low-cost producers
in Asia. If our European customers are unable to successfully compete with Asian manufacturers, they
could reduce their volume of purchases, including from us, or cease making such purchases altogether. To a
lesser extent we are also exposed to the risk of our customers in North America being unable to compete
in the global marketplace. Each of these risks could materially adversely affect our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

**_Raw materials and suppliers—If we are unable to pass on increases in raw material prices, or to retain or_**
**_replace our key suppliers, our results of operations may be negatively affected._**

Our margins are largely a function of the relationship between the prices that we are able to charge
for our products and the cost of the feedstocks and energy we require to make these products. The prices
for a large portion of our raw materials are cyclical and are correlated closely to the prices of crude oil. Prices
of oil rose during 2016 and continued to rise during 2017 and most of 2018, before falling again towards
the end of 2018. Prices again rose in 2019, but fell significantly in early 2020 on the back of global uncertainties
when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other major oil producing nations
(“OPEC+”) were initially unable to reach an agreement on production levels for crude oil, at which point
Saudi Arabia and Russia initiated efforts to aggressively increase production. The convergence of these events
with the COVID-19 pandemic created the unprecedented dual impact of a dramatic decline in the demand


-----

for oil as a result of the significant slowdown in the global economy coupled with the risk of a substantial
increase in supply. The result was a steep decline in oil prices during the first half of 2020, which negatively
impacted our margins due to inventory holding losses, however, price increases in the second half of 2020
mitigated full year losses. Prices increased further in 2021 and have become more volatile as a result of
sanctions against Russia imposed in early March 2022. After having reached a peak mid-2022, prices have
slightly declined since but, at the date of this offering memorandum, remain significantly above 2021
levels.

While we attempt to match raw material price increases with corresponding product price increases,
our ability to pass on increases in the cost of raw materials to our customers is, to a large extent, dependent
upon our contractual arrangements and market conditions. There may be periods of time during which
we are not able to recover increases in the cost of raw materials due to our contractual arrangements or to
weakness in demand for, or oversupply of, our products. Specifically, timing differences in pricing between
raw material prices, which may change daily, and product prices, which in many cases are negotiated only
monthly or less often, sometimes with an additional lag in effective dates for increases, have had and may
continue to have a negative effect on profitability. Even in periods during which raw material prices decline, we
may suffer decreasing profits if raw material price reductions occur at a slower rate than decreases in the
selling prices of our products.

Significant volatility in raw material costs tends to place pressure on product margins and working
capital needs as sales price increases could lag behind raw material cost increases. Conversely, when raw
material costs decrease, customers may seek relief in the form of lower sales prices. Even where we are able
to pass on raw material price increases to our customers, timing differences between when we purchase raw
materials and when we sell our products have had and may continue to have a negative effect on our
results of operations. In addition, some of our customers take advantage of fluctuating prices by building
inventories when they expect product prices to increase and reducing inventories when they expect product
prices to decrease. Further, volatility in costs and pricing can result in commercial disputes with customers
and suppliers with respect to interpretations of complex contractual arrangements. Significant adverse
resolution of any such disputes could also reduce our profitability.

Recently, we have seen increasing pressure on our supply chain due to several factors, including
labor availability, global logistics and increasing energy prices, that are in part due to the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine on the global economy. See “—Outbreaks of
disease—The outbreak of contagious diseases may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations, financial condition and cash flows.” and “—Invasion of Ukraine—The ongoing military
action between Russia and Ukraine could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations.”If our suppliers are negatively affected by events beyond our control, including unforeseen public
health crises, terrorist attacks, wars and other armed conflicts, including Hamas’s attack against Israel and
the ensuing war, and political instabilities, they could become unable to provide products and services as
agreed, leading to follow-on consequences for our relationships with our customers, subcontractors and
other third parties. See “—Wars and other armed conflicts—The ongoing military actions between Russia
and Ukraine and between Israel and Hamas could adversely affect our business, financial condition and
results of operations”. In addition, sanctions imposed on Russia in connection with its conflict with
Ukraine, Nordstream pipeline explosions and limitations on LNG imports can put severe pressure on gas
supply, which we rely on for our production. Russia still supplies gas to some European countries and remains
one of the largest global producers, putting pressure on regional and global markets. While this has been
mitigated so far by the warm 2022/2023 winter, an increase of European LNG import capacity, high storage
levels and increased usage of coal, we cannot rule out future disruptions as demand increases.

Climate change, and regulatory requirements related to addressing climate change, may also result
in higher raw material and energy costs, higher operating costs or supply chain disruptions due to extreme
weather events, extreme temperatures, or increased demand for limited resources or renewable fuel mandates,
which may also impact our operations and sales, including profitability and customer retention. See
“—Climate change—Existing and proposed regulations to address climate change by limiting greenhouse
gas emissions may cause us to incur significant additional operating and capital expenses.”

We obtain a significant portion of our raw materials from selected key suppliers. If any of these
suppliers is unable to meet its obligations under present supply agreements, we may be forced to pay higher
prices to obtain the necessary raw materials and we may not be able to increase prices for our finished
products. Therefore, volatility in raw material prices or interruptions in supply could place increased pressure
on our margins and reduce our cash flow, which could impair our ability to make debt payments or make
further investments in our business.


-----

If we fail to maintain our relationships with our current suppliers, our suppliers offer pricing and
other terms that are not satisfactory to us or a supplier fails to supply raw materials that meet our quality,
quantity and cost requirements, we may be unable to fill our customers’ orders on a timely and cost-effective
basis or in the required quantities, which could result in order cancellations, decreased revenues or loss of
market share and damage to our reputation.

**_Global economy—Our industry is affected by global economic factors including risks associated with economic_**
**_recessions and our customers’ access to credit._**

We face risks attendant to changes in consumer demand for goods that incorporate our products,
economic environments, increasing energy prices, rising inflation and changes in interest rates, and instability
in securities markets around the world, among other factors. In particular, a worsening economic climate
can result in decreased industrial output and decreased consumer demand for products including automobiles,
consumer goods and building materials, all of which incorporate our products. Adverse economic
conditions can affect consumer and business spending generally, which would result in decreased demand
for goods that incorporate our products and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

Our financial results are substantially dependent upon the overall economic conditions in the United
States, Europe and Asia. An extended recession in any of these locations or globally—or public perceptions
that result in declining economic conditions—could substantially decrease the demand for our products
and adversely affect our business. During 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, margins and volumes
were adversely impacted across all regions, as numerous countries experienced lockdowns resulting in
lower market demand. During the second half of 2022 and into 2023, an era of high interest rates, rising
inflation, geopolitical uncertainty and climate chaos is undermining economic confidence around the globe.
Moreover, many of our customers rely on access to credit to adequately fund their operations. The
inability of our customers to access credit facilities may adversely affect our business by reducing our sales,
increasing our exposure to accounts receivable bad debts and reducing our profitability.

**_Currency fluctuations—We are exposed to currency fluctuation risks in several countries that could adversely_**
**_affect our profitability._**

Although we report our results in euro, we conduct a significant portion of our business in
countries that use currencies other than the euro, and we are subject to risks associated with currency
fluctuations.

Our results of operations may be affected by both the transaction effects and the translation effects
of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We are exposed to transaction effects when one of our
subsidiaries incurs costs or earns revenue in a currency different from its functional currency. Fluctuations
in exchange rates may also affect the relative competitive position of our manufacturing facilities, as well as
our ability to market our products successfully in other markets. We are exposed to currency fluctuation
when we convert currencies that we may receive for our products into currencies required to pay our debt,
or into currencies in which we purchase raw materials, meet our fixed costs or pay for services, which could
result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates. In particular, a large proportion of
our manufacturing costs, and our selling, general and administrative expenses are incurred in currencies
other than the euro, principally the U.S. dollar and the British pound, reflecting the location of our sites and
corporate and business support centers. In addition, a large proportion of our outstanding debt instruments
is denominated in currencies other than the euro, including the U.S. dollar. At the same time, although
many of our sales are invoiced in currencies other than the euro, our consolidated revenues are reported in
euro. Our financial results in any given period are materially affected by fluctuations in the value of the euro
relative to the U.S. dollar, British pound and other relevant currencies. If the value of the euro declines
against currencies in which our obligations are denominated or increases against currencies in which our
revenues are denominated, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially affected.

This could include the possibility of an increase in the amount of our U.S. dollar-denominated
indebtedness when converted into euro, as was the case in 2018 and 2019 when the value of the U.S. dollar
relative to the euro increased, before decreasing in 2020, increasing again in 2021 and most of 2022 and then
decreasing again at the end of 2022 with periods of volatility in 2023 (although remaining below the peak
2022 levels and above 2021 levels).

**_Outbreaks of disease—The Group’s operations and financial results have been negatively impacted by the_**
**_outbreak of COVID-19, and the outbreak of other contagious diseases may have a material adverse effect on_**
**_our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows._**

Around the world, governments have been taking measures since 2020 in response to the COVID-19
outbreak, including imposing quarantines, vaccine requirements and travel restrictions and closures of


-----

various institutions; additional measures may also be imposed in response to new variants of the
SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including such
governmental actions, have resulted in significant disruptions and uncertainty in economic activity around
the world.

The adverse impacts the Group has or may experience due to COVID-19 or future contagious
diseases or global health pandemics include, but are not limited to:

    - infections and quarantining of the Group’s employees in areas in which the Group operates;

     - the Group’s ability to satisfy the terms of its contracts with customers in a timely or appropriate
manner;

    - cancellations, delays or downsizing of projects by the Group’s customers;

     - our customers, service providers or suppliers experiencing financial distress, filing for bankruptcy
protection or insolvency, going out of business, or suffering disruptions in their businesses;

    - weaker demand in all regions for some of our core products;

     - logistical complexities in, and disruptions to, personnel travel and equipment and supply delivery
to certain locations;

    - the need to introduce measures to reduce the Group’s costs and capital expenditure including
reduction of its global workforce, implementation of a hiring and salary freeze and executive pay
cuts, a review and deferral of the timing of planned turnarounds and a reduction in nonessential capital expenditures;

    - increased risk of impairments as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the
Group’s profitability;

     - liquidity challenges, including the inability to refinance debt, obtain additional financing or sell
assets on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, exhaustion of borrowing capacity and the need
to implement liquidity preservation measures, as well as impacts related to delayed customer
payments and payment defaults associated with customer liquidity issues and bankruptcies;

     - structural shifts in the global economy and its demand for petrochemical products as a result of
changes in the way people work, travel and interact, or in connection with a global recession or
depression;

     - the risk that the Group’s insurance coverage is not likely to cover losses associated with pandemics
like COVID-19 under its policies; and

    - cybersecurity issues, as digital technologies may become more vulnerable and experience a
higher rate of cyberattacks in the environment of remote connectivity due to stay-at-home orders.

Although we have experienced no significant impact from the COVID-19 pandemic to date and do
not currently expect any impact in 2024 and beyond, the Group’s operations and financial results were
negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and any worsening of the current situation or the
occurrence of new disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and
results of operations.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had significant impacts on the financial markets. The associated
principal risks to us as a result of this volatility in the financial markets include weaker currencies and the
liquidity risk associated with potential increases in borrowing costs and the availability of debt financing. The
economic impact of COVID-19 and of any future contagious diseases will depend on the continuing
spread of the outbreak and the responses of the authorities and the global community. Although the Group
has taken various measures as of the date of this offering memorandum to address the impacts of
COVID-19, we can give no assurance that these or other measures implemented in the future will be
sufficient. The COVID-19 situation and any resurgence thereof is dynamic, and updates on travel restrictions,
shutdowns of non-essential businesses and shelter-in-place/stay-at-home orders are continually evolving.
The extent of the COVID-19 outbreak’s continued effects and any future pandemic’s impact on the Group’s
operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration, spread
and intensity of the outbreak and other variants and the government measures implemented in response, or
whether widespread shutdowns return, all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict considering the
rapidly evolving landscape. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic or any future pandemic adversely affects


-----

our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations, it may also have the effect of
heightening other risks described in this offering memorandum.

**_International operations—We are exposed to risks related to conducting operations in several different_**
**_countries._**

We currently have manufacturing facilities located in the United Kingdom, the United States,
Germany, Belgium, Norway, Singapore and Canada. Notwithstanding the benefits of geographic
diversification, our business is subject to risks related to the differing legal, political, social and regulatory
requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions. Risks inherent in international operations
include the following:

     - general economic, social or political conditions in the countries in which we operate could have
an adverse effect on our earnings from operations in those countries;

     - risk of a widespread outbreak of an illness or other public health crisis, such as the COVID-19
outbreak, the timing and nature of which may differ across the various jurisdictions in which we
operate, see also “—Outbreaks of disease—The outbreak of contagious diseases may have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.”;

     - compliance with a variety of laws and regulations, including sanctions, in various jurisdictions
may be burdensome, see also “—Compliance—We are exposed to the risk of violations of anticorruption laws, economic and trade sanctions or other similar regulations.”;

    - unexpected or adverse changes in laws or regulatory requirements in various jurisdictions may
occur;

     - the imposition of withholding taxes or other taxes or royalties on our income, or the adoption of
other restrictions on foreign trade or investment, including currency exchange controls;

     - adverse changes in export duties, quotas and tariffs and difficulties in obtaining export licenses;

     - intellectual property rights may be more difficult to enforce;

    - transportation and other shipping costs may increase;

     - staffing difficulties, national or regional labor strikes or other labor disputes;

     - the imposition of any price controls;

     - difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables; and

    - volatility of foreign exchange rates, see also “—Currency fluctuations—We are exposed to
currency fluctuation risks in several countries that could adversely affect our profitability.”

In addition, as we increase our footprint into new territories such as Asia, our business may be
exposed to further economic and geopolitical risks as well as political and social instability which may
adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, certain
markets in which we may operate in the future are emerging markets that are rapidly developing and differ
from the economies of most developed countries in material respects, including the macroeconomic challenges
they face, the rapidly evolving nature of their financial and legal systems and the extent of government
involvement. Operating in these markets presents certain risks, including political and economic instability,
the inability to protect contractual or legal rights, market volatility and liquidity, rapid demographic and
market changes, evolving laws and regulations in respect of the chemical industry, potential expropriation
or nationalization of property or assets, and comparatively underdeveloped legal, financial and enforcement
systems.

**_The Chinese government’s policy and regulations and changes thereto with respect to outbound investment,_**
**_foreign currency, export levels and trade protectionism, as well as negative changes in the political and economic_**
**_conditions in China, present geopolitical risks that could harm our business, results of operations and financial_**
**_condition due to our increased manufacturing footprint in China._**

We conduct a significant portion of our business in China through sales of materials and products
in the country. We also maintain a large physical presence in China through our interest in joint ventures
held through Unrestricted Subsidiaries. We have recently increased our manufacturing presence in China to
meet rapidly growing demand of our products in the region. China was one of the world’s fastest growing
economies for a number of years but recently has experienced a period of economic uncertainty and sluggish


-----

growth in 2023. If China’s pace of growth continues to decline, this may result in further negative
consequences such as more tariffs which may create impediments to trade in China and other regions. As a
result, negative changes in the economic conditions in China can have a material and adverse impact on
our financial condition.

The Chinese government has occasionally made significant changes in its policies and regulations
with respect to foreign investment and foreign currency, including increases in interest rates, application of
exchange controls, changes in tax policies, price controls, currency devaluation and capital controls, among
other measures. Chinese companies with the majority of their operations in China, including our joint
venture partner Sinopec, as well as any future Chinese partners, may be adversely affected by these policies
and regulations, especially with regard to the amount of foreign currency they are able to remit from China.
For instance, in response to persistent capital outflow from China, the People’s Bank of China (“PBOC”)
and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (“SAFE”) have implemented a series of capital control
measures, including stricter vetting procedures for Chinese domestic companies to remit foreign currency for
overseas investments, dividend payments and other capital account transactions. Although these capital
controls purport to apply only to capital account transactions, in practice they have also caused delays to
current account transactions, including payments of contractually agreed fees. Any reduction or elimination
of the amounts our partners in China are able to pay to us, or any constraints placed on our ability to
enter into or obtain revenue from contracts with Chinese entities in the future, would have a material adverse
impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.

The government of China has also implemented economic policies aimed at increasing domestic
consumption of Chinese-made goods. These policies may have the effect of reducing the supply of goods
available for exports and the level of international trading and may, in turn, result in a decrease in demand
for our products in China.

The U.S.-China trade war, that has imposed tariffs on our production in those countries since 2018
and 2019, has resulted in uncertainty in the global economy, reducing confidence and growth. Future
actions of the U.S. administration and that of other governments, including China, with respect to tariffs
or international trade agreements and policies remain unclear. The escalation of a trade war, tariffs, retaliatory
tariffs or other trade restrictions on products and materials imported by us into or out of China may
significantly hinder our ability to provide our products to customers in China or other affected locations.
Such developments may result in a decrease in demand for our products as well as delays in payments from
our customers and, due to the location of our production facilities and customer base, could
disproportionately affect our products as compared to those of our competitors. All of the above could
hinder our ability to compete effectively in the markets in which we operate in the future and our competitive
position and results of operations may suffer as a result.

**_Wars and other armed conflicts—The ongoing military actions between Russia and Ukraine and between_**
**_Israel and Hamas could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations._**

On February 24, 2022, Russian military forces launched a military action against Ukraine, which has
resulted in sustained conflict and disruption in the region. We do not have operations in Belarus, Russia or
Ukraine, and revenue generated in these countries is not material to the Group. To date we have not
experienced any material disruption to our operations from the ongoing military action between Russia and
Ukraine. However, the length, impact and outcome of the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine is highly
unpredictable. This conflict could lead to significant market and other disruptions, including significant
volatility in energy and other commodity prices. It could also lead to significant disruptions to financial
markets and the supply chain and changes in consumer or purchaser preferences, as well as increases in
cyberattacks and espionage. See “—Global economy—Our industry is affected by global economic
factors including risks associated with economic recessions and our customers’ access to credit.”

Russia’s annexation of Crimea, recognition of two separatist republics in the Donetsk and Luhansk
regions of Ukraine and subsequent military action against Ukraine have led to sanctions being levied by
the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada, Switzerland, Japan and other
countries against Russia, Belarus, the Crimea, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions of Ukraine, the so-called
Donetsk People’s Republic and the so-called Luhansk People’s Republic, including, among others, the
removal of certain Russian financial institutions from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial
Telecommunication (SWIFT) payment system, which can significantly hinder the ability to transfer funds
in and out of Russia. The situation is rapidly evolving as a result of the conflict in Ukraine, and the United
States, the European Union, the United Kingdom and other countries or jurisdictions may implement
additional sanctions, export controls or other measures against Russia or other countries, regions, officials,


-----

individuals or industries in the respective territories. Such sanctions and other measures, as well as any
potential responses from Russia or other countries to such sanctions, tensions and military actions, could
adversely affect the global economy and financial markets and could adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations. For further details on sanctions see “—Compliance—We are exposed
to the risk of violations of anti-corruption laws, economic and trade sanctions or other similar regulations.”

On October 7, 2023, Hamas infiltrated Israel’s southern border from Gaza and conducted a series
of attacks on civilian and military targets. Following the attack, Israel’s security cabinet declared war
against Hamas and launched a military campaign against Hamas-led Palestinian militant groups. We do
not have operations in Israel or Gaza and revenue generated in these regions is not material to the Group.
To date we have not experienced any material disruption to our operations from the ongoing military action
between Israel and Hamas. However, the length, impact and outcome of the ongoing military conflict in
the Middle East is highly unpredictable and there can be no assurances that further unforeseen events related
to this conflict will not have a material adverse effect on our operations in the future. For example, conflict
in and around the Red Sea could pose risks to transportation, shipping and picking up in the area. This may
have an impact on the transport of modules and materials for Project ONE and may impact INEOS’
businesses generally.

We are actively monitoring the situations in Ukraine and the Middle East and assessing their
impact on our business. We have no way to predict the progress or outcome of the conflicts in Ukraine and
the Middle East or their impact in these regions as the conflict, and any resulting government reactions,
are rapidly developing and beyond our control. The extent and duration of the military actions, sanctions
and resulting market disruptions could be significant and could potentially have substantial impact on the
global economy and our business for an unknown period of time. Any of the abovementioned factors
could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any such disruptions may also
magnify the impact of other risks described in this offering memorandum.

**_Competition—We face significant competition in our industries, whether through efforts of new or current_**
**_competitors or through consolidation of existing customers, which may adversely affect our competitive position,_**
**_sales and overall operations._**

The markets for most of our products are highly competitive. We are exposed to the competitive
characteristics of several different geographic markets and industries. Competition in most of our industries
is based primarily on price and, to a lesser extent, on product performance, product quality, product
deliverability and customer service. Our principal competitors vary from business to business and range
from large global petrochemical companies to numerous smaller regional companies. Some of our competitors
are larger and more vertically integrated than we are and therefore may be able to manufacture products
more economically than we can. In addition, some of our competitors have greater financial, technical,
research and technology and marketing resources than we do. Furthermore, some of our competitors are
fully or partially state-owned and could have broader goals than maximizing profits, such as investing in the
economies of their respective countries and providing local employment and therefore may continue to
provide capacity and products even at unprofitable price points creating downward pricing pressure on our
products. As the markets for our products expand, we expect that existing competitors may commit more
resources to the markets in which we operate, further enhancing competition. All of the above could hinder
our ability to compete effectively in the markets in which we operate in the future and our competitive
position and results of operations may suffer as a result. For example, in the petrochemical industry in
Europe, where the majority of our petrochemical assets are concentrated, and, to a lesser extent, in North
America, we face competitive pressures from companies with facilities in the Middle East, which enjoy
substantial cost advantages due to access to low-cost gas feedstock available in this region. In addition,
our export business in Europe faces competitive pressures from export businesses in North America (including
our own North American operations) due to the abundance and use of low-cost ethane in North America.
These cost advantages are particularly significant when oil prices are high, as has been the case in recent years.
The competitive pressure we experience could be exacerbated if the Chinese economy fails to grow as
expected or Chinese capacity additions are more than expected, in which case more of the product
manufactured in the Middle East to meet the growth expected in China could be redirected to Europe and
North America, potentially resulting in greater supply to these markets and corresponding downward pricing
pressure.

In addition, a number of our customers are participants in industries that are undergoing
consolidation. We could lose these customers to competitors if they are acquired by, or consolidate with,
other companies that have relationships with our competitors.


-----

**_Customers—We are subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers._**

Our credit procedures and policies may not be adequate to minimize or mitigate customer credit
risk. Our customers may experience financial difficulties, including bankruptcies, restructurings and
liquidations. These and other financial problems that may be experienced by our customers, as well as
potential financial weakness in our industry, may increase our risk in extending trade credit to customers. A
significant adverse change in a customer relationship or in a customer’s financial position could cause us
to limit or discontinue business with that customer, require us to assume more credit risk relating to that
customer’s receivables or limit our ability to collect accounts receivable from that customer, all of which could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our
insurance may not compensate us for all or any of such negative effects.

**_Acquisition of DEA UK, certain subsidiaries of Fairfield Energy and DONG Energy A/S Oil & Gas business_**
**_by INEOS Upstream Limited—We face a risk of loss if INEOS Upstream Holdings Limited is unable to repay_**
**_the loans extended to the related party._**

INEOS Upstream Limited has acquired natural gas assets in the North Sea from a U.K. subsidiary
of DEA Deutsche Erdoel AG, which is part of the LetterOne Group and from Fairfield Energy (collectively,
the “2015 Upstream Acquisitions”) by way of acquiring certain of its subsidiaries. INEOS Upstream
Limited is a wholly-owned, oil and gas subsidiary of INEOS Limited, thereby making it our affiliate. In
connection with the 2015 Upstream Acquisitions, the Group advanced a loan of $623.7 million to INEOS
Upstream Limited, the proceeds of which have been on-lent to certain of its subsidiaries. Following a
corporate reorganization, this loan has been novated to INEOS Upstream Holdings Limited. The loan is
unsecured, matures in June 2024 and bears interest at 7% per annum.

On September 29, 2017, INEOS Upstream Limited acquired further natural gas assets in the
North Sea through its acquisition of the entire oil and gas business of DONG Energy A/S (the “DONG
**Acquisition”). In connection with the DONG Acquisition, the Group advanced a loan of $376.2 million to**
INEOS Upstream Limited, the proceeds of which were on-lent to certain of its subsidiaries. Following a
corporate reorganization, this loan has been novated to INEOS Upstream Holdings Limited. The loan is
unsecured, matures in June 2024 and bears interest at 7% per annum.

As at September 30, 2023, the total aggregate amount outstanding on the 2015 Upstream
Acquisition loan and the DONG Acquisition loan was $617.1 million (€584.2 million).

In the event that INEOS Upstream Holdings Limited is unable to repay the 2015 Upstream
Acquisitions loan or the DONG Acquisition loan, the Group will suffer losses as a result.

**_Inability to maximize utilization of assets—We may be adversely affected if we are unable to implement our_**
**_strategy to maximize utilization of assets._**

Our results of operations are materially influenced by the degree to which we utilize our assets in
order to achieve the most efficient production volumes. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to
implement our strategy of maximizing utilization of assets in accordance with our plans or at all. For
example, the number and length of turnarounds (scheduled outages of a unit in order to perform necessary
inspections, tests to comply with industry regulations and any maintenance activities that may be necessary)
and unplanned outages have had, and may in the future have, an impact on our operating results, even if such
outages are covered by insurance.

**_Joint ventures—Several of our petrochemical facilities are owned and operated in joint ventures with third_**
**_parties. We do not control these joint ventures, and actions taken by our joint venture partners in respect of these_**
**_joint ventures could materially adversely affect our business._**

Several of our petrochemical facilities are owned and operated in whole or part by joint ventures
with one or more third parties. These facilities include Cedar Bayou in Texas, which is operated by Chevron
Phillips Chemical Company LLC (“Chevron Phillips”) in a 50:50 joint venture with Chevron Phillips, the
Shanghai SECCO Petrochemical Company Limited facility in Shanghai, China (“SECCO”), which is
operated by Sinopec in a 50:50 joint venture with an Unrestricted Subsidiary of the Group. In August 2023,
the Group acquired a 50% interest in, through an Unrestricted Subsidiary, another 50:50 joint venture
concerning the Tianjin Nangang Ethylene Project, which is currently under construction by Sinopec and is
expected to be on-stream in the second half of 2024. While we have a certain amount of influence over each
of these joint ventures, we do not control them and are therefore dependent on our respective joint
venture partners to cooperate with us in making decisions regarding the relevant joint venture. Moreover,


-----

the day-to-day operation of the relevant facilities is the responsibility of the management team of the joint
venture or our joint venture partner. Therefore, our ability to influence these operations on a day to day basis
is limited and we may be unable to prevent actions that we believe are not in the best interests of our joint
ventures or our Group as a whole. Any such actions could materially adversely affect our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

**_Climate change—Existing and proposed regulations to address climate change by limiting greenhouse gas_**
**_emissions and restrictions on other air emissions, may cause us to incur significant additional operating and_**
**_capital expenses or adversely affect demand for our products._**

Our operations result in emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHGs”), such as carbon dioxide and
methane. Growing concern about the sources and impacts of global climate change has led to a number of
regional, national and supranational legislative and administrative measures, both proposed and enacted, to
monitor, regulate and limit carbon dioxide and other GHG emissions. As a result, our operations, as well
as those of our customers, are subject to stringent regulations relating to carbon dioxide and other GHG
emissions. Compliance with these requirements may require us to install additional pollution reduction and
control equipment, purchase additional emissions allowances or credits or implement other operational
changes, such as alternative fuels, which could increase our production or compliance costs or, to the extent
such requirements affect demand by, or increase costs for, our customers, negatively affect our profitability
or demand for our products.

At the international level, many nations have agreed to limit emissions of GHGs pursuant to the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, also known as the “Kyoto Protocol.” Methane,
a primary component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide, a byproduct of the burning of oil, natural gas,
and refined petroleum products, are two of the GHGs addressed by the Kyoto Protocol. Although the United
States is not a party to the Kyoto Protocol at this time, all member states of the European Union and the
United Kingdom have ratified it. As a result of commitments made at the UN climate conference in Durban,
South Africa in December 2011, certain members of the international community negotiated a treaty at
the December 2015 Conference of Parties in Paris (the “Paris Agreement”). The Paris Agreement, which
entered into force in November 2016, requires developed countries to set targets for emissions reductions once
the Paris Agreement is adopted by those individual countries within their respective national or federal
law. Additional measures requiring reductions in GHG emissions have been, or may be, implemented by
countries in which we operate.

The European Union committed in December 2020 to reduce GHG emissions in its member states
to no more than 55% of 1990 levels by 2030, on the condition that other major economies undertake to do
their part in the global attempt to reduce emissions and commit to taking steps to achieve net-zero GHG
emissions in the European Union by 2050. The European Climate Law, adopted by the European Union
in July 2021, includes legally binding targets to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 and to reduce net GHG
emissions by at least 55% by 2030. Such targets are binding on all European Union member states.

In the European Union, our GHG emissions are currently regulated under the European Union
Emissions Trading System (the “EU ETS”), an EU-wide system that imposes emissions limits and permits
trading of allowances for industrial GHG emissions. The EU ETS has become, and is expected to continue to
become, progressively more stringent over time, including by reducing the total number of allowances to
emit GHGs as well as those that EU member states will allocate without charge to industrial facilities and
by introducing and/or increasing fees for allowances. Such measures could result in increased costs for us to:
(i) operate and maintain our facilities; (ii) install new emission controls; (iii) purchase or otherwise obtain
allowances to emit GHGs; and (iv) administer and manage our GHG emissions program. Our costs to
purchase emissions allowances under the EU ETS and UK ETS (discussed below) totaled approximately
€20.0 million in 2022, and annual costs are expected to be similar for 2023 and 2024.

In line with the European Union’s goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 and a 55% reduction
in GHGs by 2030, on July 14, 2021, the European Commission released a number of legislative proposals
collectively called “Fit for 55”. The proposals envision significant changes to current EU ETS functions and
requirements, including: new national limits on GHG emissions, a new carbon border adjustment
mechanism (“CBAM”) to impose carbon pricing on imports into the European Union of selected products,
further reduction of free CO2 allowances allocated to heavy industry and extending emissions trading
requirements to additional industrial sectors. Specifically with respect to CBAM, which was formally adopted
by the EU on May 10, 2023, importers of certain goods (initially including cement, iron and steel,
aluminium, fertilizers, hydrogen and electricity, as well as certain precursors) have to report emissions
embedded in their goods in a transitional phase, which began on October 1, 2023. Once the definitive system


-----

is fully operational (expected in 2026), EU importers will also be required to surrender CBAM certificates
purchased at prices that correspond to the carbon price that would have been paid if the goods had been
produced in the EU (less any carbon price actually paid by the non-EU producer of the goods). Although
the initial list of goods covered by CBAM is limited, such list may be expanded to include other imported
goods, the process for obtaining carbon emissions information from non-EU producers or the cost and
availability of future allowances or CBAM certificates. The Council and the European Parliament reached
a provisional political agreement on certain points of the “Fit for 55” package in December 2022, and a
majority of the proposals have since been adopted. The measures remain subject to the EU legislative
process, including adoption or implementation by individual member states, and at this time we cannot
predict the terms of any regulations that may be enacted in the future or the impact of any such regulations
on our business, operations or financial condition.

The United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union on January 31, 2020 pursuant to
Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union (“Brexit”). Accordingly, the UK government is no longer
subject to the EU legislation that commits the EU member states to reducing carbon emissions, increasing
energy efficiency and increasing renewable energy production, including in respect of the European Climate
Law adopted by the European Commission. In addition, the United Kingdom is no longer a participant
in the EU ETS. In January 2021, the United Kingdom implemented a UK Emissions Trading Scheme (“UK
**ETS”), which was subsequently extended through 2050. Like the EU ETS, the UK ETS has industrial**
sites receiving or purchasing allowances to emit GHGs and surrendering one allowance for each ton of
carbon dioxide emitted. Companies which emit fewer GHGs than their allowances cover are able to sell the
excess allowances, whereas those which emit more must buy additional allowances through the UK ETS.
At present, no agreement to link the carbon pricing systems in the EU and the UK has been formalized. In
December 2023, the UK government announced that it plans to make various reforms to the UK ETS,
including aligning the UK ETS cap with the net zero trajectory beginning in 2024 and expanding the UK
ETS to include CO2 venting by the upstream oil and gas sector, the waste and maritime sectors as well as,
subject to consultation, engineered GHG removals. Separately, the UK government has announced that it
plans to implement its own CBAM by 2027, by applying a carbon price to imported goods from the
following sectors: aluminium, cement, ceramics, fertiliser, glass, hydrogen, iron, and steel. Further details
relating to the design and implementation of the UK CBAM will be subject to further consultation in 2024.
In addition, as a result of the Paris Agreement, in June 2019, the UK government enacted legislation
requiring reduction of GHG emissions to net zero by 2050, including a target to reduce GHG emissions by
68% of 1990 levels by 2030, and more recently committed to a target to reduce GHG emissions by 78% of
1990 levels by 2035. In connection with Brexit, the UK government also introduced legislation designed to
transfer responsibility for the Industrial Emissions Directive (“IED”), which takes an integrated approach
to controlling pollution and sets strict industry standards for the most polluting industries, and the BAT
Conclusion, which contain emissions limits associated with Best Available Techniques (“BAT”), to
competent authorities in the UK and to put in place a process for determining future UK BAT Conclusions
for industrial emissions. The UK government’s Clean Air Strategy for England sets out actions for
determining future UK BAT for industrial emissions. Our operations in the UK will continue to operate
under the legislative framework applied in the United Kingdom. The Environment Act 2021 received royal
assent on November 9, 2021, and introduced certain provisions regarding targets, plans and policies for
improving the natural environment and certain other matters, including provisions relating to air quality.
Commencement regulations to bring certain provisions in the Environment Act 2021 into force have yet to
be enacted.

In the United States, we are required to monitor and report to the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (“EPA”) annual GHG emissions from certain of our U.S. facilities. In addition, the EPA has
promulgated regulations under the Clean Air Act (“CAA”), which subject the GHG emissions of certain
newly constructed or modified facilities to pre-construction and operating permitting requirements. Pursuant
to these requirements, newly constructed or modified facilities with the potential to emit certain quantities
of GHGs are required to implement “best available control technology,” which may include carbon efficiency
standards, GHG emission concentration limits, specific technology requirements or other measures.
Significant uncertainty exists as to how newer or stricter GHG regulations will in the future impact large
stationary sources, such as our facilities in the United States, and what costs or operational changes these
regulations may require. For example, in early 2024, the EPA is expected to finalize its butadiene maximum
achievable control technology (“MACT”) rule. At this time, the estimated cost for the Chocolate Bayou
site to comply with this regulation by the deadline in 2026 is expected to be approximately $40 million, to
be incurred over three years.

In addition, the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce
emissions of GHGs and numerous U.S. states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of


-----

GHGs primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and or/regional GHG capand-trade programs. Although the U.S. Congress has not adopted such legislation at this time, it, or
additional U.S. states, may do so in the future, along with other countries (in addition to the European
Union). U.S. President Biden has made climate change a focus of his administration. In addition to reentering the Paris Agreement, on January 27, 2021 President Biden issued a pair of executive orders and a
presidential memorandum setting out several administrative priorities undertakings focused on climate
change. In April 2021, the Biden administration announced a target for the country to achieve a 50-52%
reduction in GHG emissions compared to 2005 levels by 2030 and a goal of achieving net zero GHG
emissions by 2050. We cannot yet predict the form regulations or other binding obligations adopted by the
United States, the European Union or the United Kingdom to meet their commitments under the Paris
Agreement or to otherwise reduce their GHG emissions will take (such as a cap-and-trade program,
technology mandate, emissions tax, carbon floor price or other regulatory mechanism) or, consequently,
estimate any costs that we may be required to incur in respect of such requirements, for example, to install
emissions control equipment, purchase emissions allowances, administer and manage our GHG emissions
program or address other regulatory obligations. Such requirements could also adversely affect our
energy supply, or the costs (and types) of raw materials we use for fuel. Requirements arising from these, or
different, regulations controlling or limiting GHG emissions could have a material adverse impact on our
business, financial condition or results of operations, including by reducing demand for our products.

In addition, our two joint-ventures in China with Sinopec are also subject to emission requirements
under the laws of the People’s Republic of China on Environmental Protection.

**_Environmental matters—We will have ongoing costs and may have substantial obligations and liabilities_**
**_arising from health, safety, security and environmental (“HSSE”) laws, regulations and permits applicable to_**
**_our operations._**

Our businesses are subject to a wide range of HSSE laws and regulations in all of the jurisdictions
in which we operate. These requirements govern our facilities and our operations, including the manufacture,
storage, handling, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, water
consumption, wastewater discharges, air emissions (including GHG emissions), noise emissions, the
operation and closure of landfills, human health and safety, process safety and risk management and the
clean-up of contaminated sites. Many of our operations require permits and controls to monitor or prevent
pollution, and these permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation by issuing authorities. We
have incurred, and will continue to incur, substantial ongoing capital and operating expenditures to ensure
compliance with current and future HSSE laws, regulations and permits or the enforcement of such
requirements.

We expect that our operations will be subject in the future to new and increasingly stringent HSSE
laws, regulations and permit conditions and that substantial costs will be incurred by us to ensure continued
compliance. We anticipate that these laws, regulations and permit conditions, including in respect of GHG
emissions reduction commitments or requirements, will continue to require us to incur substantial costs and
impose additional operating and capital obligations. Given the nature of our business, violations of HSSE
requirements, whether currently alleged or arising in the future, may result in substantial fines or penalties, the
imposition of other civil or criminal sanctions, cleanup costs, claims for personal injury or property
damages, or restrictions on, or the suspension of, our operating permits or activities or require the installation
of costly pollution control equipment. Our facilities are subject to periodic inspections by regulatory
authorities to assess compliance with applicable HSSE laws and regulations. If we do not predict accurately
the amount or timing of costs of any future compliance, remediation requirements or private claims, our
environmental provisions may be inadequate and the related impact on our business, financial condition or
results of operations in any period in which such unanticipated costs need to be incurred could be material.

At certain sites where we operate, regulators have alleged, or we have otherwise identified potential
or actual noncompliance with HSSE laws and/or the permits which authorize operations at these sites.
Some of these allegations or instances of noncompliance are ongoing, and substantial amounts may need
to be spent to attain and/or maintain compliance. In addition, we have in the past paid, and in the future may
pay, penalties to resolve such matters. Our businesses and facilities have experienced, and in certain cases,
are in the process of investigating or remediating, hazardous materials in the soil and groundwater at locations
where we operate and/or adjacent properties and/or natural resources at public and private lands not
owned by us.

Many of our sites have an extended history of industrial chemical processing, storage and related
activities, and may currently be subject to engineering or institutional controls or restrictions or may


-----

become subject to such controls or restrictions in the future. We are currently, and from time to time have
been or in the future may be, required to investigate and remediate releases of hazardous materials or
contamination at or migrating from certain of these sites, as well as properties we formerly owned, leased
or operated. We are, and in the future may be, responsible for investigating and cleaning up contamination
at off-site locations where we or our predecessors disposed of or arranged for the disposal or treatment of
hazardous wastes. Under some environmental laws, including the U.S. Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly referred to as “Superfund,”liability for contamination
can be imposed retroactively, without regard to fault or knowledge, and on a joint and several basis. In
addition, we could be subject to claims by government authorities, individuals and other third parties seeking
damages for alleged personal injury or property or natural resource damages resulting from environmental
contamination or hazardous exposure caused by our operations, facilities or products. The discovery of
previously unknown contamination, or the imposition of new obligations to investigate or remediate
contamination at our facilities, could result in substantial unanticipated costs. We could be required to
establish or substantially increase financial reserves for such obligations or liabilities and, if we fail to
accurately predict the amount or timing of such costs, the related impact on our business, financial condition
or results of operations in any period in which such unanticipated costs need to be incurred could be
material. In addition, HSSE laws and regulations can impose various financial responsibility requirements
on us, and pursuant to these requirements we may be required to post bonds, create trust funds or provide
other assurances that we will be able to address contamination at our sites and comply with our
decommissioning obligations once our facilities reach the end of their useful lives.

Our operations involve the intensive use of hazardous materials and we have been from time to
time subject to claims made for damage to property or injury, including adverse health effects, to employees
and other persons, resulting from our operations. Claims made in the future could have a material adverse
effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.

Our operations involve significant water usage, with material annual industrial water costs expected
to be incurred in 2023 and 2024 similar to those incurred in previous years. Changes to environmental
regulations and other factors, such as water shortages as a result of climate change, could increase the cost
and/or limit the availability of water, which would in turn impact our operating and production costs.

Our financial results may be adversely affected if environmental liability arises for which we are not
adequately indemnified, or from a disposal of assets or businesses for which we provided a seller’s
indemnification in respect thereof. Although we believe that the indemnities given by the selling parties
from whom we have acquired assets or businesses will help defray the costs associated with pre-acquisition
environmental liabilities, our financial results may still be adversely affected to the extent that:

     - the sellers do not fulfill their respective indemnification obligations;

     - we breach our obligations not to undertake certain activities that may aggravate existing
conditions or to mitigate associated losses;

     - we incur indemnification obligations for other environmental liabilities owed as part of certain
disposals of assets or businesses; or

     - we incur significant costs for pre-acquisition conditions that are not covered by the indemnities.

**_Potential hazards—Our operations are subject to hazards which could result in significant liability to us._**

Our operations are subject to hazards associated with chemical manufacturing and the related use,
storage, transportation and disposal of raw materials, products and wastes. These hazards include explosions,
fires, severe weather (including but not limited to floods, hurricanes on the U.S. Gulf Coast or in Gulf
waters or other adverse weather that may be increasing in intensity and/or frequency as a result of climate
change) and natural disasters, accidents, mechanical failures, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous
substances or gases, transportation interruptions, human error, pipeline leaks and ruptures and terrorist
activities. These hazards can cause, and have caused from time to time, personal injury and loss of life, severe
damage to or destruction of property and equipment as well as environmental damages, and may result in
suspension of our operations and the imposition of civil and criminal liabilities, including penalties and
damage awards. For instance, in July 2023, an ethylene pipeline ruptured and ignited at a remote location
in Texas, causing a fire that resulted in business losses estimated to be approximately €49 million. While we
believe our insurance policies are in accordance with customary industry practices, such insurance may not
cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations, including deductibles
and maximum liabilities covered. We may incur losses beyond the limits, or outside the coverage, of our
insurance policies, including liabilities for violations of environmental requirements and contamination. In


-----

addition, from time to time, various types of insurance for companies in our industries have not been
available on commercially acceptable terms or, in some cases, have not been available at all. In the future, we
may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels, and/or our premiums may increase significantly on
coverage that we maintain. Costs associated with unanticipated events in excess of our insurance coverage
could have a material adverse effect on our business, competitive or financial position or our ongoing results
of operations. For additional related disclosure, see “Business—Health, Safety, Security and Environment.”

**_Compliance—We are exposed to the risk of violations of anti-corruption laws, economic and trade sanctions_**
**_or other similar regulations._**

As a result of our international activities, we are subject to the laws and regulations of the various
countries in which the Group operates. In particular, our international operations may be subject to anticorruption laws and regulations such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, the UK Bribery Act
of 2010 and the local anticorruption laws of any jurisdiction applicable to us. In addition, our international
operations may be affected by sanctions and economic restrictions imposed by the UK Office of Financial
Sanctions Implementation, the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control, the European Union, the United
Nations, or other law enforcement agencies or sanctions authorities. Countries or jurisdictions that are
subject to economic sanctions and export controls currently imposed by the United States, the European
Union or the United Kingdom include the Crimea, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions of Ukraine (in each
case to the extent that such areas of Kherson or Zaporizhzhia are under control of Russia), the so-called
Donetsk People’s Republic, the so-called Luhansk People’s Republic, Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Syria.
Such list of countries or jurisdictions may change from time to time.

While we have developed policies, procedures and training designed to achieve and maintain
compliance with applicable laws, the Group could be exposed to investigations, claims and other regulatory
proceedings for alleged or actual violations of laws related to our operations, including anti-corruption
and anti-bribery legislation, trade laws and sanctions laws. As there can be no assurance regarding EU, UK
or U.S. enforcement policy with respect to economic sanctions, it is possible that the relevant authorities
could take a different view regarding our sanctions compliance efforts, which could potentially lead to
negative adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition and prospects. If we are found to be
subject to any laws or regulations which we considered were not applicable, our policies, procedures and
actions may be in breach of such law or regulation and we may be subject to censure, prosecution, fines or
other negative consequences. Furthermore, laws, regulations or licensing policies on economic sanctions or
export controls could change and additional countries may introduce economic sanctions, export control
or similar regimes. Any alleged violation of current or future applicable laws or regulations, either erroneously
or substantiated in the future, could result in civil or criminal liability for us, our employees, entities or
partners, the imposition of fines, or other penalties, as well as negative publicity or reputational damage,
and could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Third parties—Our business and operations are subject to business interruption risks due to the actions of_**
**_third parties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and_**
**_results of operations._**

Due to the nature of our business, we are at risk of business interruption due to the actions of
third parties. For example, many of our vendors and subcontractors have operations that are also subject to
HSSE risks, including those associated with the use, storage and transport of hazardous materials. Any
future HSSE-related incidents affecting our vendors and subcontractors may result in significant regulatory
actions, fines and other penalties, including restrictions, prohibitions or sanctions on their operations
which could impair their ability to perform their contracts with us or could otherwise subject us to claims
or liability, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition
and results of operations. In addition, if any facilities experience damage or temporary closures due to
incidents or events, including protests, caused by third parties, our reputation, business and results of
operations may be adversely affected.

**_Product stewardship regulation—Our business could be adversely affected by chemical safety regulation of our_**
**_products and raw materials._**

We use and manufacture hazardous chemicals that are subject to regulation by the European
Union and by many national, provincial and local governmental authorities in the countries in which we
operate. In order to obtain regulatory approval of certain new products and production processes, we are
required, among other things, to demonstrate to the relevant authorities that the product is safe for its
intended uses and that we are capable of manufacturing the product in accordance with applicable regulations.


-----

The process of obtaining approvals can be time-consuming and subject to unanticipated and significant
delays. Approvals may not be granted to us on a timely basis, or at all. Any delay in obtaining, or any failure
to obtain or maintain, these approvals would adversely affect our ability to introduce new products, to
continue distributing existing products and to generate revenue from those products, which could have a
material adverse effect on our business and prospects. New laws and regulations may be introduced in the
future that could result in additional compliance costs, confiscation, recall or monetary fines, any of which
could prevent or inhibit the development, distribution and sale of our products.

In addition, some of our products (including our raw materials) are subject to extensive
environmental and industrial hygiene regulations that require the registration and safety analysis of and, in
some cases, impose restrictions on, their component substances. For example, in connection with the European
Union’s Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (“REACH”) Regulation and/or the
European Union’s Classification, Labelling and Packaging (“CLP”) Regulation, any key raw material,
chemical or substance, including some of our products, could be classified as having a toxicological, healthrelated or otherwise adverse or relevant effect, including impacts on the environment, on users of our
products, or workers handling these products. In the event of such a classification, those key raw materials,
chemicals, substances and/or products could be banned or restricted for certain uses. The European
Commission aims to propose a revision of the REACH regulation in 2024. At this time we cannot predict
the impact of any such revision. We manufacture, process, or use certain substances classified as substances
of very high concern under REACH, including 2-methoxyethanol and propylene oxide, and the continued
use of these substances may require authorization from the European Chemicals Agency (“ECHA”). If we
cannot obtain authorization, we may need to discontinue use of such substances.

In June 2016, amendments to the U.S. Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”) became effective,
and it is possible that they could result in risk screening by the EPA of substances we produce or use, and
this risk screening could lead to new or more stringent regulatory obligations and/or restrictions, including
prohibitions on the manufacture and sale of certain substances. Since December 19, 2016, the EPA has
designated 20 chemical substances as high-priority and 20 chemical substances as low-priority that are the
subject of the EPA’s initial chemical risk evaluations, as required by TSCA. This list includes multiple chemicals
we manufacture, including carbon tetrachloride, methylene chloride and 1,3-butadiene. The list of
substances is expected to be expanded over time.

In Ontario, Canada, the Toxics Reduction Act (which was repealed on December 31, 2021)
required a review of the use of toxic substances including certain raw materials from which our products
are synthesized. Among other things, this statute required tracking, preparation and publication of toxic
substance reduction plans and government and public reporting. The Chemicals Management Plan, which
was created in 2006 under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999, governs the assessment and
management of risks associated with chemical substances to human health and the environment, including
government and public reporting. Similar regulations are being considered in other jurisdictions, including
the United States, which could result in additional requirements, including notification, testing, labelling and
record-keeping obligations, on our operations.

We are further subject to emerging laws and regulations governing workplace exposure to certain
chemicals. For example, benzene has been identified as a genotoxic carcinogen. ECHA’s Committee for
Risk Assessment (“RAC”) proposed reducing the occupational exposure limit (“OEL”) for benzene to 0.05
ppm as the maximum allowable concentration in air at workplaces in the European Union. In response,
the EU Commission published the fourth revision of the Carcinogenic and Mutagenic Directive (“CMD”)
which sets out a revised OEL for benzene of 0.5 ppm for a transitional period from April 2024 to April 2026
and 0.2 ppm from April 2026. The European Commission will assess a further reduction of the OEL for
benzene according to the CMD. The CMD also sets out a new OEL of 0.45 ppm for acrylonitrile, a monomer
used in many plastics, which becomes effective April 2026. Because we produce benzene and acrylonitrile,
we will become subject to these OELs. As another example, butadiene has been classified as a known human
carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the U.S. National Toxicology Program
and the EPA. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration currently limits the permissible
employee exposure to butadiene. If studies on the health effects of butadiene result in additional regulations
in the United States or new regulations in Europe that further restrict or prohibit the use of, and exposure
to, butadiene, we could be required to change our operations, which could affect the quality of our products
and increase our costs.

Growing concern about the sources and impacts of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”)
may also lead to increased regulation of such substances in jurisdictions where the Group operates. For
instance, in January 2023, the EPA proposed a rule that would prevent the manufacture, processing, or use


-----

of an estimated 300 PFAS without a complete EPA review and risk determination. In December 2022, the
EPA also proposed a rule that would eliminate an exemption that allowed facilities to avoid reporting
information on PFAS when those chemicals were used in limited concentrations. In October 2023, the EPA
published a final rule that requires all manufacturers (including importers) of PFAS and PFAScontaining articles in any year since 2011 to report information to the EPA on PFAS uses, production
volumes, disposal, exposures and hazards. In addition, in the EU several national authorities submitted to
ECHA a universal proposal to restrict PFAS. A consultation was launched in 2023. The European
Commission, together with the EU Member States, will evaluate and determine if any PFAS restrictions
will be formally proposed or enacted. Such enacted and proposed regulations, and other being considered
or adopted in jurisdictions in which the Group operates, could require the Group to incur significant costs
including, inter alia, relating to compliance, modifying operations, and altering product inputs.

The regulation or reclassification of any of our raw materials or products could result in a ban on
its import, purchase or sale, adversely affect the availability of raw materials or marketability of our
products, or require us to incur increased costs to comply with notification, labeling, handling, processing,
distribution, sale and transport requirements, each of which could result in a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_ESG—A failure to understand, manage and provide greater transparency of our exposure to environmental,_**
**_social and governance (ESG) related risks may have increasingly adverse implications for us and our_**
**_stakeholders._**

ESG-related risks may directly or indirectly impact our business and the achievement of our
strategy and consequently our key stakeholders, which range from our employees, customers, investors and
suppliers, to policymakers, regulators, industry organizations and local communities. For example, new
and proposed laws and regulations in the UK, EU and the U.S. requiring the identification, quantification
and disclosure of ESG risks, including those relating to sustainability, climate change, supply chain, human
capital, diversity and cybersecurity, are under consideration or being adopted, or may be in the future.
These requirements have resulted in, and may continue to result in, our need to make additional investments
and implement new practices and reporting processes, which will require management attention and the
incurrence of additional compliance risk. Any failure or perceived failure to accurately report on our current
or future ESG-related commitments, including our GHG emissions reduction commitments, and any
differences between our commitments and those of any companies to which we are or may be compared,
could harm our reputation, adversely affect our ability to effectively compete or expose us to potential legal
liability. In addition, any failure or perceived failure to transparently and consistently implement our ESG
strategy across our business or to achieve our goals and commitments, may adversely impact our financial
condition and reputation and may negatively impact our stakeholders, each of whom, in turn, have ESGrelated expectations, concerns and aims, which may differ, both within and across the markets in which we
operate. For more information on our ESG strategy, see “Business—Sustainability.”

**_ESG—Increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors, lenders and other market participants_**
**_with respect to ESG performance and policies may impose additional costs on us or expose us to additional_**
**_obligations or risks._**

Companies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny related to ESG issues, including
those relating to sustainable development, renewable resources, environmental stewardship, supply chain
management, climate change, diversity and inclusion, workplace conduct, employee well-being, human
rights, philanthropy and support for local communities. Investor advocacy groups, certain institutional
investors, investment funds, lenders, employees and other market participants are increasingly focused on
ESG practices, performance and disclosures. In recent years, financial stakeholders have placed increased
importance on the environmental and social cost and impact of their investments and consider that the
petrochemicals industry faces ESG risks that some other industries do not. The increased focus and
activism related to ESG and similar matters may hinder access to or increase the cost of capital, as investors
and lenders may decide to reallocate capital or to not commit capital as a result of their assessment of a
company’s ESG practices. We have made certain voluntary commitments with respect to ESG performance,
such as a 33% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 (as compared to 2019) and achievement of net zero
by 2050, and achieving these commitments will require us to implement facility upgrades that we expect to
require significant capital investments. If we fail to meet applicable standards or expectations with respect to
these issues across all of our operations and activities, our reputation and brand image could be damaged,
we may lose the trust of our stakeholders (including investors, customers and employees), and our business,
financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted. In addition, while we seek to


-----

report our ESG practices and performance in alignment with certain relevant reporting frameworks and to
engage with leading sustainability rating agencies and other stakeholders, these frameworks and ratings
providers may not be the same as those evaluated by our stakeholders, may emphasize different aspects of
ESG practices and performance, or may not accurately reflect our ESG performance in certain respects. In
addition, changes in consumer and market demands, regulatory requirements and other ESG-related
considerations may negatively impact our perceived ESG performance or otherwise impact our reputation
and accordingly our business and financial results.

**_ESG Risk Ratings—The third-party ESG Risk Ratings referenced in this offering memorandum may not_**
**_accurately reflect our risks based on environmental, social and governance matters. Any actual or perceived_**
**_lack of transparency or underperformance regarding ESG matters as a result of increasing scrutiny and changing_**
**_expectations from investors, lender and other market participants may adversely affect the value of the Notes._**

The impact of our ESG-related risks and practices, including with respect to various environmental,
social and governance matters in our business and in the local communities in which we operate, has been
and will continue to be independently assessed by non-accredited ratings organizations and various
stakeholders in the ESG community. These rating agencies and stakeholders may not view our ESG policies
as sufficiently transparent or consistent with their performance standards or goals. If this view were
shared in the broader ESG community, our reputation could be damaged which, in certain cases, could
effectively limit our access to capital markets and result in scrutiny regarding our commitment to ESG
principles and standards.

In addition, ESG ratings may vary among the different ESG ratings organizations and are subject
to differing methodologies, assumptions and priorities used by such organizations to assess ESG
performance and risks. Each ESG rating provider’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other
ESG rating provider’s rating. There is no guarantee that the methodology used by any particular ESG rating
provider will conform with the expectations or requirements of any investor or any present or future
applicable standards, recommendations, criteria, laws, regulations, guidelines or listing rules. As a result,
our ESG ratings are not necessarily indicative of our current or future operating or financial performance,
our commitment to ESG standards and principles, or any future ability to service our indebtedness including
the Notes, and are only current as of the dates on which they were issued. Any ESG rating obtained by the
Group or its affiliates provides no guarantee as to the actual environmental and/or social impacts of the
Group or its affiliates. In addition, individual company ratings may be based on only publicly available
information and in other cases may be based on information supplied by the relevant companies. As such,
the quality of information in respect of each company included in our rankings may not be comparable and
therefore there may be limitations on the utility of these rankings. Prospective investors must determine
for themselves the relevance of any such ESG rating information contained in this offering memorandum
or elsewhere in making an investment decision. Moreover, ESG ratings are not a recommendation by us or
any other entity or person to buy, sell or hold the Notes. Each of the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates
makes no representations as to the accuracy or validity of the ESG Risk Ratings and assume no liability
with respect to the consequences of any reliance that may be placed on this information. As of the date of
this offering memorandum, none of Sustainalytics, which has provided an ESG rating for INEOS Group
Holdings S.A. as disclosed in “Business—Sustainability—Sustainalytics Rating”, and EcoVadis, which
has provided an ESG rating for INEOS AG, one of our ultimate parent undertakings, as disclosed in
“Business—Sustainability—EcoVadis Gold Award”, is subject to any regulatory or other governmental
oversight in respect of its determination of ESG ratings or the underlying methodologies it uses to make such
determinations and may revise or replace entirely the methodology it applied to derive its ESG ratings. No
assurance can be given that the ESG Risk Ratings will remain constant for any given period of time or that
the ESG Risk Ratings will not be withdrawn entirely by Sustainalytics or EcoVadis if, in their judgment,
circumstances in the future so warrant. The past or future issuance of any ESG ratings which reflect low
performance on ESG matters or high ESG-related risk, or are not consistent with our own views on our
commitment to implement ESG principles and standards throughout our business and our commitment to
our business and local communities as an ESG company, could adversely affect the value of the Notes.

**_A failure to implement and commercialize recycling solutions may have adverse implications for us and our_**
**_stakeholders._**

Increasingly, governmental authorities are considering, or have already adopted, legislation that
requires a minimum amount of recycled content in certain products and applications. For now, officially
adopted legislation focuses mostly on packaging. For example, in the European Union the Packaging and
Packaging Waste Regulation (“PPWR”) requires a minimum recycled content of between 10% and 35% for


-----

the plastic part of packaging by 2030. In the U.S., minimum recycled content requirements are being
defined at the state level. For example, California requires 25% of plastics to be recycled by 2025 and 65%
by 2032. Industry-specific regulations have been adopted in some jurisdictions, such as the End-of-Life
Vehicles (“ELV”) Directive for automotive applications in the European Union and the Waste Electrical
and Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”) regulations in the United Kingdom and European Union for electronics
and household applications.

In order to maintain our competitive market share, we will have to invest in recycling technologies
to support our customers. This ongoing investment and research carries various risks, such as significant
capital expenditure requirements that could divert available resources, as well as implementation failure. We
are pursuing partnership and cooperation agreements for multiple recycling technologies but there is a
risk that we invest in the wrong technology or fail to successfully implement the chosen technology.
Regulations on recycled content require waste access in large volumes and high purity levels for recycled
materials. As waste collection, sorting and cleaning infrastructure is just being developed, there is a risk of
lack of sufficient feedstock.

Our efforts to implement and commercialize recycling solutions also presents regulatory and
product safety risks. For example, food industry regulations require recycled plastics to comply with the
same regulations as non-recycled plastics. While we can steer recycling and cleaning processes, we do not have
the same influence on waste streams and their composition. This presents a risk of contamination and
potential liabilities.

**_Tax Burden—Our tax burden could increase due to changes in tax law or the application or interpretation_**
**_thereof, or as a result of current or future tax audits or investigations._**

Our tax burden is dependent on certain aspects of tax laws across several different jurisdictions
and their application and interpretation. Changes in tax laws or their interpretation or application could
increase our tax burden. As a result of future tax audits or other review actions of the relevant financial or
tax authorities, additional taxes could be identified, which could lead to an increase in our tax obligations,
either as a result of the relevant tax payment being levied directly on us or as a result of us becoming
liable for tax as a secondary obligor due to a primary obligor’s (such as, for example, an employee’s) failure
to pay. Due to our international focus, we are exposed to tax risks, in particular with regard to transfer
pricing rules that apply in several jurisdictions. Pursuant to these rules, related enterprises must conduct any
inter-company transactions at conditions that would apply among unrelated third parties concluding
comparable agreements (the “arm’s length principle”) and provide sufficient documentation thereof, subject
to particular rules applicable to them in the relevant jurisdiction. Although we have adopted a transfer
pricing policy, tax authorities may, and from time to time do, challenge our compliance with applicable
transfer pricing rules, and we therefore must seek to ensure that our transfer pricing policies accurately reflect
the operating model of our business. Any successful challenge to our arrangements, including with respect
to exit charges, could cause us to face a higher tax burden and be subject to tax penalties or fines, which could
have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_Litigation—We are subject to certain risks related to litigation filed by or against us, and adverse results may_**
**_harm our business._**

We cannot predict with certainty the cost of defense, the cost of prosecution or the ultimate
outcome of litigation and other proceedings filed by or against us, including remedies or damage awards,
and adverse results in any litigation and other proceedings may materially harm our business. Litigation and
other proceedings may include, but are not limited to, actions relating to intellectual property, commercial
arrangements (including disputes with contractors, suppliers and customers), environmental matters, permits,
health and safety, joint venture agreements, mergers and acquisitions, labor and employment or other
harms resulting from the actions of individuals or entities outside of our control. For example, appeals
contesting our first full environmental permit for Project ONE were filed with the Council for Permit
Disputes in Flanders, Belgium, resulting in the annulment of the permit. Although a second permit was
granted by the Flemish Minister for Justice and Enforcement, Environment and Spatial Development and
Energy and Tourism on January 7, 2024, had our application been unsuccessful and a new permit not granted,
this would have had a material adverse effect on our ability to successfully complete Project ONE within
the anticipated timeframe and, if we were unsuccessful after significant expenditure had been incurred on
the project, this could have had a material adverse effect on our business. Although at this time no appeals to
the new permit have been filed, it is expected that one or more parties could challenge the issuance of the
new permit prior to the expiration of the appeals period in February 2024. Any such appeal, if successful,
could significantly delay the project and significantly increase costs. If ultimately a permit cannot be retained,


-----

it is possible that the project may not be completed, which would require us to write off significant sunk
costs and leave us with significant debt in connection with facility financing for Project ONE. Other challenges
to our permit for Project ONE, or for other operations, if filed in the future, could have a material adverse
effect on our business. See also “Business—Legal proceedings.”

In the case of intellectual property litigation and proceedings, adverse outcomes could include the
cancellation, invalidation or other loss of material intellectual property rights used in our business and
injunctions prohibiting our use of business processes or technology that are subject to third-party patents
or other third-party intellectual property rights or the imposition of license fees to be paid to the holders of
any such third-party intellectual property rights. Litigation based on environmental matters or human
exposure to hazardous substances in the workplace or from our products could result in significant liability
for us. Adverse outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business.

**_Product liability—We may be liable for damages based on product liability claims._**

The sale of our products involves the risk of product liability claims arising out of the use of, or
exposure to, our products or the chemicals in them. While most of our products have some hazardous
properties, some of them, such as acrylonitrile, require specialized handling procedures due to their acute
and chronic toxicity. Furthermore, our polymer products have widespread end uses in a variety of consumer
industries, including food packaging and medical applications. A successful product liability claim or
series of claims against us in excess of our insurance coverage for payments for which we are not otherwise
indemnified or have not otherwise provided for could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition or results of operations and cash flows. In particular, we could be required to increase
our debt or divert resources from other investments in our business in order to discharge any such claims.

In addition, we have licensed our polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinylchloride, vinyl
chloride monomer, ethylene dichloride and acrylonitrile technologies to third parties. Generally, our licensing
agreements provide that any liability arising from the implementation of such technology is retained by us
during the first 18 months of the agreements. As a result, we are liable for any damages arising from the
implementation by our licensees of our technology during this period.

**_Key personnel—Our success depends on the continued service of certain key personnel._**

Our success depends in significant part upon the continued service of our shareholders, directors
and senior management, including James A. Ratcliffe, Andrew Currie and John Reece and the executive
officers at each of our business divisions. In addition, our future growth and success also depends on our
ability to attract, train, retain and motivate skilled managerial, sales, administration, operating and technical
personnel. We generally do not have employment agreements with, and we do not maintain any “key
man” life insurance for, any member of our senior management. The loss of one or more of our key
management or operating personnel, or the failure to attract and retain additional key personnel, could
have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Relations with employees and service providers—We depend on good relations with our workforce and service_**
**_providers, and any significant disruption could adversely affect us._**

As of September 30, 2023, we had approximately 7,500 employees (measured as full-time equivalents
(“FTEs”)) in our operations around the world, not including employees of our joint ventures. The majority
of our employees are unionized. In addition, a majority of our employees resides in countries in which
employment laws provide greater bargaining or other rights to employees than the laws of the United States.
These employment rights may require us to expend greater time and expenses in altering or amending
employees’ terms of employment or making staff reductions. For example, most of our employees in Europe
are represented by works councils which generally must approve changes in conditions of employment,
including salaries and benefits. Further, a labor disturbance or work stoppage at any of our facilities as a
result of any changes to our employment terms and conditions or for any other reason could have a material
adverse effect on that facility’s operations and, potentially, on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

We also use independent contractors to provide us with certain technical assistance and services. In
certain cases, we may exercise limited control over the activities and business practices of these providers
and any inability on our part to maintain satisfactory commercial relationships with them or their failure to
provide quality services (including as a result of work stoppages or labor disturbances at such providers)
could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.


-----

**_Intellectual property—The failure of our patents, trademarks and confidentiality agreements to protect our_**
**_intellectual property could adversely affect our business._**

Proprietary protection of our processes, apparatuses and other technology is important to our
business, including our manufacturing activities. Our actions to protect our proprietary rights may be
insufficient to prevent others from developing similar products to ours. In particular, we may be unable to
secure adequate protection or management of intellectual property during capital investment projects, in
particular in new countries and certain of the emerging-markets jurisdictions in which we operate, or
when key personnel leave our company to join a competitor, which may weaken our intellectual property
rights and undermine our competitive advantage. In addition, the laws of many foreign countries do not
protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and the United
Kingdom. Furthermore, any pending patent application filed by us may not result in an issued patent, or
if patents are issued to us, such patents may not provide meaningful protection against competitors or against
competitive technologies. Oppositions or other actions initiated by third parties may also limit the scope
of our patents and other intellectual property rights, thereby weakening our protection against competitors
or against competitive technologies. You should be aware that the expiration of a patent or the failure of
our patents to protect our formulations, processes, apparatuses, technology or proprietary know-how could
result in intense competition, with consequent erosion of profit margins. In addition, our competitors and
any other third parties may obtain patents that restrict or preclude our ability to lawfully manufacture and
market our products in a competitive manner, which could materially adversely affect our business, results
of operations and financial condition.

Some of our patents and patent applications are jointly owned with third parties. In many
countries, both owners have full rights under a jointly-owned patent. In the absence of a specific agreement,
such third parties may use our jointly-owned patents to compete with us or grant a license to our
competitors. In addition, co-owners may not cooperate with us to enforce or to defend a jointly-owned
patent where necessary to protect our rights.

We also rely upon unpatented proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation and
other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. While it is our policy to enter into
confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property, there
can be no assurances that:

    - our confidentiality agreements will not be breached;

    - such agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary knowhow; or

     - adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of these
trade secrets and know-how.

In addition, there can be no assurances that others will not obtain knowledge of these trade secrets
through independent development or other access by legal means.

In the past we have received communications asserting that our products or their applications
infringe on a third party’s proprietary rights. Currently, there is no material pending litigation against us
regarding any intellectual property claim but we cannot assure you that there will not be future claims. Such
claims, regardless of merit, could subject us to costly litigation and divert our technical and management
personnel from their regular responsibilities. Furthermore, if such claims are adversely determined against
us, we could be forced to suspend the manufacture of products using the contested intellectual property and
our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected if any such products are
material to our business.

We may also initiate lawsuits to defend the ownership of our inventions and our intellectual
property. Like defending against litigation, initiating litigation relating to intellectual property rights is
costly and may divert technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. Furthermore,
we may not prevail in any such litigation or proceeding. A determination in an intellectual property
litigation or proceeding that results in a finding of a non-infringement by others to our intellectual property
or an invalidation of our patents may result in the use by competitors of our technologies or processes
and sale by competitors of products that resemble our products, which may adversely affect our ability to
compete as well as create increased supply and corresponding downward pricing pressure.

**_Cybersecurity—We are subject to cybersecurity risks. A cyber incident could occur and result in information_**
**_theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss._**

Our industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain
processing activities. For example, we depend on digital technologies to perform many of our services and
to process and record financial and operating data. At the same time, cyber incidents, including deliberate
attacks, have increased. Our technologies, systems and networks, and those of our vendors, suppliers and
other business partners, may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches, such as
cyber-fraud, viruses, malware infections, or social engineering activities like phishing and employee
impersonation, all of which could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or
destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of business operations. In recent years,
cyberattacks have become more prevalent and much harder to detect and defend against. These threats
may arise from a variety of sources, all ranging in sophistication from an individual hacker to alleged statesponsored attacks. A cyberattack may be generic, or it may be custom-crafted to target the specific
information technology used by us. If, as a result of such cyberattack, our information technology systems
were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely way, we may be unable to fulfil critical business functions,
which could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business,
financial condition, and results of operations.

Although our businesses’ IT governance, risk management and compliance programs provide
availability, confidentiality and an overall security approach to all systems and business processes, including
cybersecurity controls (like intrusion detection/intrusion prevention, firewalls, mobile device management,
malware and virus protection, notebook encryption, secure VPN access, network segmentation, industrial
control system security monitoring, email and internet security, security information and event management,
threat and vulnerability management), any failure of these programs could result in a cybersecurity incident.
Increased reliance on technology carries with it an increased risk of cybersecurity issues, including phishing
and end point vulnerability, which has been particularly heightened in light of the current environment
of remote working in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended
period. Our systems for protecting against cybersecurity risks may not be sufficient. As cyber incidents
continue to evolve, we will likely be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance
our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents. Further, the
General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679), came into effect in Europe in May 2018,
which has created a range of new compliance obligations, and increased financial penalties for non-compliance
significantly. The General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) has been incorporated
into domestic law in the United Kingdom, with minor amendments, by virtue of the EUWA. While our IT
compliance programs contain certain procedures to cover (“GDPR”) by providing records of processing
activities, performing assessments on technical and organizational security measures and stipulating
contractual agreements with external service providers and business partners and our demand, change and
project management procedures have been implemented, which guarantee the involvement of the legal
department and IT security team to assess new business applications and systems, identifying GDPR
relevance and security vulnerabilities upfront, any failures of these programs could result in potential liability
for our business, losses of confidential information, reputational consequences, financial damages, higher
insurance premiums, damage to assets, safety issues, operational downtime or delays, and revenue losses,
adversely impacting our prospects, results of operations and financial condition. The significance of any such
event is difficult to quantify, but may in certain circumstances be material to the Group and could have
adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Internal controls—If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting, we_**
**_may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud._**

We have designed and continue to design our internal controls with the objective of providing
reasonable assurance that (1) our transactions are properly authorized; (2) our assets are safeguarded
against unauthorized or improper use; and (3) our transactions are properly recorded and reported, all to
permit the preparation of our consolidated financial information in conformity with applicable accounting
principles. We design our internal controls through the use of internal resources, external consultants
and, as the case may be, with joint venture partners.

Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not
absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any control system
is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other


-----

inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving
its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. Any failure to maintain
adequate internal controls or to be able to produce accurate consolidated financial information on a
timely basis could increase our operating costs and materially impair our ability to operate our business.

**_The Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement, the Existing Indentures and the Indenture—Our Senior Secured_**
**_Term Loans Agreement and the Existing Indentures impose, and the Indenture will impose, significant operating_**
**_and financial restrictions, which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and taking_**
**_certain actions._**

Our Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement and the Existing Indentures impose, and the Indenture
will impose, significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions include limitations on
our ability to:

    - make investments and other restricted payments, including dividends;

    - incur additional indebtedness;

     - sell our assets or consolidate or merge with or into other companies;

     - enter into joint ventures; and

    - make capital expenditures.

Our Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement and the Existing Indentures contain, and the Indenture
will contain, covenants that may adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations and capital
needs and to pursue available business opportunities. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a
default in respect of the related debt. If a default were to occur, the relevant holders or the relevant lenders (as
applicable) of such debt could elect to declare the debt, together with accrued interest and other fees,
immediately due and payable and, subject to certain limitations, proceed against any Collateral securing
that debt. Refer to “Description of Other Indebtedness” for further information.

**_Future acquisitions or developments—Any future acquisitions or developments may prove difficult for us to_**
**_consummate._**

We have a history of making acquisitions and in the future we may acquire companies or assets
engaged in similar or complementary businesses to our own if we identify appropriate acquisition targets,
including acquisitions of interests from our joint venture partners. For example, in April 2023, we acquired
the entire asset base of Mitsui Phenols Singapore Ltd from Mitsui Chemicals. Following announcement
of the intention to do so in July 2023, in October 2023, affiliates of the Group agreed to acquire TotalEnergies’
50% share of certain petrochemical assets at Lavéra currently operated as 50:50 joint ventures between
TotalEnergies and the Lavéra Businesses, as well as certain other infrastructure assets associated with the
site, including part of TotalEnergies’ ethylene pipeline network in southern France. The Group will,
immediately prior to the acquisition of the TotalEnergies Lavéra Businesses, complete the Lavéra
Reorganization, following which the acquisition of the TotalEnergies Lavéra Business will occur within the
Group. The Lavéra Acquisition is subject to regulatory approval and satisfaction of other customary
closing conditions and is expected to be completed in the first half of 2024. In December 2023, the Group
agreed with LyondellBasell to acquire its Ethylene Oxide and Derivatives business, including the Bayport
Underwood site in Texas, USA for $700 million. The Bayport Acquisition is expected to be completed in
the second quarter of 2024, subject to regulatory and other third-party approvals and satisfaction of other
customary closing conditions.

In addition, we also intend to organically grow our business. INEOS announced its major capital
investment in Antwerp, Belgium on January 14, 2019 (“Project ONE”) consisting of a new Ethane Steam
Cracker and a Propane Dehydrogenation Unit, for the production of ethylene and propylene, respectively,
along with associated utilities, tankage and infrastructure. Following a strategic review in 2020, INEOS has
determined that the demand for propylene in the quantities previously envisaged was less urgent. As a
result, Project ONE was rescoped to only consist of an ethane steam cracker with a nameplate capacity of
approximately 1,450 kta and associated utilities, tankage and infrastructure. Any additional European
propylene capacity will be considered separately in the future.

INEOS has selected Technip Energies to provide the operating technology for the new ethane
cracker. We believe that Project ONE remains the largest investment in the European chemicals industry for
the past 20 years and we expect it to be among the most efficient and sustainable of its kind. It is planned
to be equipped with the best available technologies with a high efficiency in use of raw materials and energy,


-----

CO2 emissions that are expected to be less than half of the currently best performing similar units in
Europe from the outset and a clear path to carbon neutrality on a Scope 1 and Scope 2 basis within 10 years
of start-up of the cracker. Latest estimates suggest that the project will represent a capital investment of
approximately €4.2 billion (of which approximately €1.1 billion was invested by the end of 2023 and
approximately €1.5 billion is expected to be invested in 2024) largely funded by debt secured on the Project
ONE assets. Construction on site began in the summer of 2022, but was suspended in the second half of 2023.
Works on Project ONE in other locations (for example in module yards around the world) have, however,
continued during this period. Works on the Project ONE site in the Port of Antwerp resumed in January 2024
when a new environmental permit was granted by the Flemish Minister for Justice and Enforcement,
Environment and Spatial Development and Energy and Tourism on appeal. See also “—Litigation—We are
subject to certain risks related to litigation filed by or against us, and adverse results may harm our
business.”

In addition, we acquired an interest in the SECCO facility in Shanghai, China, which is operated
by Sinopec in a 50:50 joint venture with an Unrestricted Subsidiary of the Group. In August 2023, we
completed, through an Unrestricted Subsidiary, another 50:50 joint venture concerning the Tianjin Nangang
Ethylene Project, which is currently under construction by Sinopec and is expected to be on-stream in the
second half of 2024. To date we have not paid any costs associated with the construction of the ethylene
complex. Under the terms of our agreement with Sinopec we are due to pay our share of the net investment
within a few months of completion. The total expected net payment is RMB 5.4 billion, the bulk of which
we expect to pay in 2024. It is our intention to fund the majority of the purchase price through incremental
limited recourse financing arrangements, similar to the Rain Facilities. We may not be able to successfully
implement our strategic and operational initiatives for these joint ventures, and an inability to realize the full
extent of anticipated benefits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

The success of these and other projects and the ability to complete them within the expected
budget and schedule will depend in part on us continuing to adequately addressing any technical, regulatory,
environmental, labor, litigation and legal challenges or other issues that may arise in connection with such
projects. We may be required to make significant additional capital expenditure beyond that planned or
exceed the respective anticipated timeframe in order to resolve issues that may arise. There can be no
assurance that the projects will be completed or that each would be completed at the anticipated cost or
within the indicated timeframe, or, once completed, operate at the anticipated rates or capacity. We may not
be able to successfully implement our strategic and operational initiatives, and an inability to realize the
full extent of anticipated benefits of such projects could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

Moreover, restrictions in the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement, the Existing Indentures and
the Indenture may limit or preclude our ability to make certain acquisitions or capital expenditures.
Further, we may use debt financing for any permitted acquisitions or capital expenditures, which would
increase our debt service requirements. In order to manage any acquisitions or development projects we
successfully complete, we will need to expand and continue to improve our operational, financial and
management information systems. If making acquisitions or integrating any acquired business or development
projects divert too much management attention from the operations or our core businesses, this could
adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Any acquisition or development project
that we make could be subject to a number of risks, including, as applicable:

     - problems with effective integration of operations;

     - the inability to maintain key pre-acquisition business relationships;

     - increased operating costs;

     - costs related to achieving or maintaining compliance with laws, rules or regulations;

    - the loss of key employees of the acquired company;

     - exposure to unanticipated liabilities; and

     - difficulties in realizing projected efficiencies, synergies and cost savings.

We cannot assure you that any acquisition or development project we consummate will ultimately
provide the benefits we originally anticipate. Furthermore, we may not succeed in identifying attractive
acquisition candidates or financing and completing potential acquisitions on favorable terms and development
projects may experience delays and cost overruns. In addition, we may make investments in joint ventures


-----

or Unrestricted Subsidiaries for future acquisitions or development projects. In that case, such joint
ventures or Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be bound by the covenants in the Senior Secured Term Loans
Agreement and the Indenture (including with respect to limitations on indebtedness and restricted
payments, including dividends).

**_Credit and capital market conditions—Adverse conditions in the credit and capital markets may limit or_**
**_prevent our ability to borrow or raise capital._**

While we believe we have facilities in place that should allow us to borrow or otherwise raise funds
as needed, adverse conditions in the credit and financial markets could prevent us from obtaining financing,
if the need arises. Our ability to invest in our businesses and refinance maturing debt obligations could
require access to the credit and capital markets and sufficient bank credit lines to support cash requirements.
If we are unable to access the credit and capital markets, we could experience a material adverse effect on
our financial position or results of operations.

**_Pension plans—Significant changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions relating to pension_**
**_costs may adversely affect the valuation of pension obligations, the funded status of pension plans, and our_**
**_pension cost._**

Our funding policy for pension plans is to accumulate plan assets that, over the long run, will
approximate the present value of projected benefit obligations. Our pension cost is materially affected by
the discount rate used to measure pension obligations, the level of plan assets available to fund those
obligations at the measurement date and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Significant
changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets may result in
corresponding increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets, particularly equity securities, or in a
change of the expected rate of return on plan assets. Any change in key actuarial assumptions, such as the
discount rate, would impact the valuation of pension obligations, affecting the reported funded status of
our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following fiscal years. Any declines in the fair
values of the pension plans’ assets could require additional payments by us in order to maintain specified
funding levels. Any decrease in interest rates will result in an increase of pension liabilities. Our pension plans
are subject to legislative and regulatory requirements of applicable jurisdictions.

**_Eurozone—Market perceptions concerning the instability of the euro, the potential re-introduction of individual_**
**_currencies within the eurozone, or the potential dissolution of the euro entirely, could have adverse consequences_**
**_for us with respect to our outstanding debt obligations that are euro-denominated._**

The Eurozone continues to be heavily indebted, which has contributed to the instability of the
financial markets. Financial markets may continue to be negatively impacted by concerns about a slowdown
in growth in certain economies of the Eurozone and uncertainties regarding the overall stability of the
euro and the sustainability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political
circumstances in individual member states. Governments and regulators have implemented austerity programs
and other remedial measures to respond to these concerns around the economies and financial system of
the Eurozone, but the actual impact of such programs and measures is difficult to predict.

In the event that concerns around the economies and financial system of the Eurozone and the
stability and sustainability of the euro are not resolved, it is possible that one or more countries may
default on their debt obligations and/or cease using the euro and re-establish their own national currency or
that the Eurozone may collapse. Should the euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences
for holders of euro-denominated obligations and for parties subject to other contractual provisions referencing
the euro such as supply contracts would be determined by laws in effect at such time.

The official exchange rate at which our euro-denominated debt instruments (including the Senior
Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Term Loans denominated in euro) may be re-denominated may not
accurately reflect their value in euro. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these
and related issues, could adversely affect the value of our euro-denominated debt instruments and could
have adverse consequences for us with respect to our outstanding debt obligations that are euro-denominated,
and, as we have a substantial amount of debt denominated in euro, our financial condition may be
materially affected.

Furthermore, a number of our debt instruments (including the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior
Secured Term Loans Agreement and the Existing Indentures) contain, and the Indenture will contain,
covenants restricting our and our subsidiaries’ corporate activities. See “Risks Relating to the Notes and
Our Capital Structure—Restrictive covenants in our debt instruments—We are subject to restrictive debt


-----

covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and to pursue
business opportunities and activities. If we default under these covenants, we will not be able to meet our
payment obligations.”Certain of such covenants impose limitations based on euro amounts (e.g., the amount
of additional indebtedness we or our subsidiaries may incur). As such, if the euro were to significantly
decrease in value, the restrictions imposed by these covenants would become tighter, further restricting our
ability to finance our operations and conduct our day-to-day business.

**_Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Capital Structure_**

**_Significant indebtedness—Our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to react to changes in_**
**_our business, and we may be limited in our ability to fulfill our obligations with respect to the Notes and to use_**
**_debt to fund future capital needs._**

We are, and after the issuance of the Notes will continue to be, significantly indebted and as of
September 30, 2023, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, we would have had total consolidated
loans and borrowings of € million as compared to total equity of €1,863.1 million. In addition,
IHL and IGH have guaranteed indebtedness of our Unrestricted Subsidiary, INEOS China Holdings
Limited, under the Rain Facilities with an aggregate principal amount of RMB 1,045 million and
$785.0 million. We also would have had €540.8 million available for future borrowings under the unused
portion of our Securitization Program. Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to
holders of the Notes by adversely affecting our financial position including, but not limited to:

     - requiring us to dedicate all of our cash flow from operations (after the payment of operating
expenses) to payments with respect to our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our
cash flow for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures, product research
and development, and other general corporate expenditures;

     - increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, adverse general
economic or industry conditions;

     - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, competition or changes in our business or
industry;

     - limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing;

     - restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or exploring business opportunities; and

     - placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that have less debt or greater
financial resources.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to
satisfy our debt obligations, including with respect to the Notes. Our ability to make payments on and
refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash from our operations. Our ability to
generate cash from operations is subject, in large part, to general economic, competitive, legislative and
regulatory factors and other factors that are beyond our control. We may not be able to generate enough
cash flow from operations nor obtain enough capital to service our debt or fund our planned capital
expenditures.

In addition, we may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future, including indebtedness
in connection with any future acquisition and indebtedness in connection with any inventory financing or
similar arrangements. The terms of the Existing Indentures and the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement
permit, and the Indenture will permit, our subsidiaries to do so, in each case, subject to certain limitations.
If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the risks that we now face could intensify. Moreover, some of
the debt we may incur in the future could be structurally senior to the Notes, and may be secured by
collateral that does not secure the Notes. For example, in connection with Project ONE, we entered into
project financing agreements to fund the majority of the capital expenditure plus associated financing costs
during construction. The indebtedness is secured by the Project ONE assets and, during the construction
phase, supported by a debt service undertaking provided by IGH, IHL and INEOS US I Inc. The Project
ONE assets will not form part of the Collateral that secures the Notes. See also “Description of Other
Indebtedness—Project ONE Facilities” and “Description of Other Indebtedness—Project ONE Interim
Facilities.”

For further information regarding our substantial leverage and for more information about our
outstanding indebtedness, see also “Operating and Financial Review and Prospects” and “Description of
Other Indebtedness.”

**_Restrictive covenants and financial covenants in our debt instruments—We are subject to restrictive debt_**
**_covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and to pursue business_**
**_opportunities and activities. We are also subject to financial covenants in certain of our debt instruments which_**
**_require us to maintain minimum levels of financial performance. If we default under these covenants, we will_**
**_not be able to meet our payment obligations._**

The Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement and the Existing Indentures contain, and the Indenture
will contain, a number of significant covenants that restrict some of our and our subsidiaries’ corporate
activities, including our and their ability to:

     - incur or guarantee additional debt and issue certain preferred stock;

    - make restricted payments, including paying dividends or making other distributions and
prepaying or redeeming subordinated debt or equity;

     - create or incur certain liens;

     - sell, lease or transfer certain assets;

     - enter into arrangements that restrict dividends or other payments to us;

    - create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or
advances and on the transfer of assets;

     - engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

     - create unrestricted subsidiaries; and

     - consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries
on a consolidated basis.

All of these limitations are or will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See
“Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants.” The covenants to which we are subject could limit our
ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities
and activities that may be in our interest.

Also, the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement requires us and some of our subsidiaries to
comply with certain affirmative covenants. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Senior Secured Term
Loans.”

Our ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond our
control. These include prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If we breach any of these
covenants or restrictions, we could be in default under the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement. This
would permit the lenders to take certain actions, including declaring all amounts that we have borrowed under
the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid
interest. A failure to pay such amounts would also result in an event of default under the Existing Indentures
and the Indenture. If we are unable to repay our debt to the lenders, they could proceed against the
Collateral that secures the debt under the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement, the Existing Notes,
certain hedging liabilities and certain cash management liabilities, and the Notes. If the debt under our Senior
Secured Term Loans Agreement, the Existing Notes or any other material financing arrangement that we
enter into were to be accelerated, our assets may be insufficient to repay in full the Notes and our other debt.

Further, our other debt instruments may include maintenance financial covenants. For instance,
our Unrestricted Subsidiary, INEOS China Holdings Limited as borrower is subject to financial covenants
under the terms of the Rain Facilities, which are tested by reference to SECCO EBITDA, as well as net
debt incurred by SECCO. IGH and IHL are both guarantors under the Rain Facilities. The EBITDA
covenant is tested with effect from the 12-month period expiring December 31, 2023, while the net debt
covenant is tested with effect from December 31, 2023. With SECCO’s EBITDA being, as of the date of this
offering memorandum, negative, INEOS China Holdings Limited may not be able to meet the financial
covenants under the Rain Facilities, which would require us to make certain sinking fund payments to cure
any default. If INEOS China Holdings Limited breaches any of these covenants and any such breaches are
not cured, the lenders of the Rain Facilities may be permitted to take certain actions, including declaring
all amounts that INEOS China Holdings Limited has borrowed (and IGH and IHL have guaranteed) under
the Rain Facilities to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. This may have an
impact on our ability to continue to make payments in respect of the Notes when due. See also “Description
of Other Indebtedness—Rain Facilities.”


-----

**_Securitization Program—We use the Securitization Program to meet some of our liquidity requirements, and_**
**_are subject to various covenants under the Securitization Program, which, if we are unable to comply with them,_**
**_could result in the acceleration of our debt._**

Unless the maturity date of the Securitization Program is extended, the Securitization Program will
mature in December 2026. We satisfy a significant amount of our short-term liquidity needs with amounts
available under the Securitization Program. While we have in principle agreed to terms with our securitization
providers, our ability to refinance the Securitization Program could be affected by a number of factors,
including volatility in the financial markets, contractions in the availability of credit, including in interbank
lending, and changes in investment markets, including changes in interest rates, exchange rates and
returns from equity, property and other investments. Our liquidity will be adversely affected if we are
unable to refinance the Securitization Program on acceptable terms or at all, and we can provide no assurance
we will be able to do so.

The availability under the Securitization Program varies depending on the underlying receivables.
For a more detailed discussion, please see “Description of Other Indebtedness—Securitization Program.”
In addition, the Securitization Program contains various covenants, and if we fail to comply with these
covenants, a default may occur under the Securitization Program. If a default occurs under the
Securitization Program, we may need to fund our working capital requirements from other sources.

**_No Revolving Credit Facility—We do not have a revolving credit facility, which may adversely affect our_**
**_short-term liquidity._**

We do not have a revolving credit facility. While we believe we have sufficient cash on our balance
sheet to meet our working capital needs, such amounts may not be sufficient. Should we require cash in an
amount exceeding the cash available for cash collateralized letters of credit, our short-term liquidity will be
adversely affected.

**_Ability to repay and service debt—To repay or refinance and service our debt, we will require a significant_**
**_amount of cash._**

Our ability to make principal or interest payments when due on our indebtedness, including the
Notes, the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement and the Existing Notes, will depend upon our future
performance and our ability to generate cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond
our control. The ability of our subsidiaries to transfer monies upstream to us, as well as to pay operating
expenses and to fund planned capital expenditures, any future acquisitions and research and development
efforts, will depend on our businesses’ ability to generate cash in the future, as well as limitations that may be
imposed under applicable law. This, to an extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive,
legislative, regulatory and other factors, including those factors discussed in this “Risk Factors” section or
elsewhere in this offering memorandum, many of which are beyond our and our subsidiaries’ control. Please
see “Selected Consolidated Financial Information” and “Operating and Financial Review and Prospects.”
If we sustain losses in the future, our ability to repay and service our debt may be materially impaired.

If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our payment obligations, we may be
forced to reduce or delay planned expansions or capital expenditures, sell significant assets, discontinue
specified operations, obtain additional funding in the form of debt or equity capital or attempt to restructure
or refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity. We cannot assure you that we would be
able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.
In addition, the terms of our debt, including the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement, the Existing
Indentures and the Indenture, will limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives. If we are unsuccessful
in any of these efforts, we may not have sufficient cash to meet our obligations.

**_Financing a change of control offer—We may not be able to raise the funds necessary to finance a change of_**
**_control offer required by the Existing Indentures and the Indenture, and, if this occurs, we would be in default_**
**_under the Existing Indentures and the Indenture._**

Under the terms of the Existing Indentures and the Indenture, we will be required to offer to
repurchase or repay the Existing Notes or the Notes, as applicable, if certain events constituting a change
of control occur. Our obligations under the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement could also be accelerated
upon the occurrence of a change of control under the Existing Indentures or the Indenture or other
change of control events. It is possible that we may not have sufficient funds at the time of a change of
control to repurchase any or all of the Existing Notes or the Notes, or repay our outstanding obligations
under the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement. We expect that we would require third party financing to


-----

make an offer to purchase or repay, as applicable, the Existing Notes and the Notes or to repay our
outstanding obligations under the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement upon a change of control. We
cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such financing. Our failure to repurchase or repay, as
applicable, any or all of the Existing Notes and the Notes would be an event of default under the Existing
Indentures and the Indenture, respectively, and would cause a cross default under the Senior Secured
Term Loans Agreement. Similarly, a failure to repay the Senior Secured Term Loans upon a change of
control would cause a cross default under the Existing Indentures and the Indenture. You should read the
section titled “Description of the Notes—Purchase of Notes upon a Change of Control” for further
information regarding the change of control provisions.

The change of control provisions contained in the Indenture may not protect you in the event of
highly leveraged transactions and other important corporate events, including reorganizations, restructurings,
recapitalizations, mergers or similar transactions that may adversely affect you, because these transactions
may not involve a change in voting power or beneficial interest of the magnitude required to trigger the
change of control provisions or, even if they do, may not constitute a “Change of Control” as defined in
the Indenture.

Except as described under “Description of the Notes—Change of Control,” the Indenture will not
contain provisions that would require us to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a
reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The definition of “Change of Control” under the Indenture will include a disposition to any
person of “all or substantially all” of the assets of Lux I and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole.
Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no
precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there
may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all
or substantially all” of the assets of Lux I and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may
be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an
offer to repurchase the Notes.

**_Post-Closing Guarantees and Collateral—The Subsequent Guarantors will not initially guarantee the Notes_**
**_and the Subsequent Collateral will not initially secure the Notes._**

When issued, the Notes will only be guaranteed by the Initial Guarantors. We will agree in the
Indenture to take such necessary actions to cause the Subsequent Guarantors to guarantee the Notes
within 90 days from (and excluding) the Issue Date (the date of such Subsequent Guarantor guaranteeing
the Notes being the “Subsequent Guarantor Accession Date”). There can be no assurance, however, that we
will be successful in procuring such guarantees and liens within the time periods specified, the failure of
which would result in an “event of default” under the Indenture. Liens on Collateral to be granted by the
Issuer and the Initial Guarantors will (subject to certain limited exceptions) be granted on the Issue Date. We
will agree in the Indenture to take such necessary actions so that no later than 90 days from (excluding )
the Issue Date, as specified in the Indenture, certain additional collateral that secures the Senior Secured Term
Loans Agreement, the Existing Senior Secured Notes, certain hedging liabilities and certain cash
management liabilities will be granted to secure the Notes (the “Post-Closing Collateral”). See also
“Description of the Collateral and the Guarantees,” “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the
Guarantees and the Security Interests” and “—Guarantees and Collateral limitations—The guarantees and
pledges of Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable
laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability.”

**_Finance Subsidiary Issuer—The Issuer is a finance company with no independent operations and is dependent_**
**_on payments under the Notes Proceeds Loan to provide it with funds to meet its obligations under the Notes._**

The Issuer is a wholly-owned finance company that conducts no business operations. It has limited
assets, no subsidiaries and a limited ability to generate revenues. Upon completion of the Offering, the only
significant assets of the Issuer will be its rights under each of the Notes Proceeds Loan, the Existing
Senior Secured Notes Proceeds Loans and the Senior Secured Term Loans Euro Proceeds Loans made by it
to IHL. The Issuer’s material liabilities will include the Notes, the Existing Senior Secured Notes, the eurodenominated Senior Secured Term Loans, the guarantee of obligations under the dollar-denominated Senior
Secured Term Loans and any additional debt it may incur in the future.

As such, the Issuer will be dependent upon payments from IHL in order to make any payments
under the Notes. If IHL fails to make scheduled payments on the Notes Proceeds Loan, the Existing Senior


-----

Secured Notes Proceeds Loans or the Senior Secured Term Loans Euro Proceeds Loans, it is not expected
that the Issuer will have any other sources of funds that would allow it to make payments on its indebtedness.

In addition, IHL is a holding company that conducts no independent business operations. The
ability of our subsidiaries to make payments to IHL to fund payments on the Notes Proceeds Loan, the
Existing Senior Secured Notes Proceeds Loans and the Senior Secured Term Loans Proceeds Loans, and the
ability of our subsidiaries to make upstream payments in general, will depend upon their cash flows and
earnings which, in turn, will be affected by all of the factors discussed in these “Risk Factors” and elsewhere
in this offering memorandum.

The payment of dividends and the making, or repayment, of loans and advances to IHL by IHL’s
direct subsidiaries and such payments by its indirect subsidiaries to their respective parent entities are
subject to various restrictions. Existing and future debt of certain of these subsidiaries may prohibit the
payment of dividends or the making, or repayment, of loans or advances to IHL or its parent entities. The
terms of the Intercreditor Deed also restrict certain intra-group payments (other than payments under the
Notes Proceeds Loan, the Existing Senior Secured Notes Proceeds Loans and the Senior Secured Term
Loans Proceeds Loans). In addition, the ability of any of IHL’s direct or indirect subsidiaries to make certain
distributions may be limited by the laws of the relevant jurisdiction in which the subsidiaries are organized
or located, including financial assistance rules, corporate benefit laws and other legal restrictions which, if
violated, might require the recipient to refund unlawful payments.

Although the Existing Indentures and the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement limit, and the
Indenture will limit, the ability of IHL’s subsidiaries to enter into future consensual restrictions on their
ability to pay dividends and make other payments to IHL, there are significant qualifications and exceptions
to these limitations. We cannot assure you that arrangements with IHL’s subsidiaries and the funding
permitted by the agreements governing existing and future indebtedness of IHL’s subsidiaries will provide
IHL with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans to fund payments on the Notes Proceeds Loan, the
Existing Senior Secured Notes Proceeds Loans and the Senior Secured Term Loans Euro Proceeds Loans
when due. See “Description of Other Indebtedness” and “Description of the Notes.”

**_Realization of Collateral—It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes._**

The Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances,
liens and other imperfections permitted under the Indenture. The existence of any such exceptions, defects,
encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral securing
the Notes as well as the ability of the Trustee to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the firstpriority ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the
timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or recharacterization under the laws of certain
jurisdictions.

The security interests of the Security Trustee are subject to practical problems generally associated
with the realization of security interests in the Collateral securing the Notes. For example, the Trustee or
the Security Trustee may need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest. We cannot
assure you that the Trustee or the Security Trustee, as applicable, will be able to obtain any such consents.
We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a
foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Trustee or the Security Trustee may not have the ability to foreclose
upon those assets and the value of the Collateral securing the Notes may significantly decrease.

Furthermore, under applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can
only be properly perfected, and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured
party and/or the grantor of the security. The liens in the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected
with respect to the claims of the Notes if we or the Trustee or the Security Trustee fail or are unable to
take the actions required to take to perfect any of these liens.

In addition, our business requires a variety of national, state and local permits and licenses. The
continued operation of properties that comprise part of the Collateral and which depend on the maintenance
of such permits and licenses may be prohibited. Our business is subject to regulations and permitting
requirements and may be adversely affected if we are unable to comply with existing regulations or
requirements or changes in applicable regulations or requirements. In the event of foreclosure, the transfer
of such permits and licenses may be prohibited or may require us to incur significant cost and expense.
Further, we cannot assure the holders of the Notes that the applicable governmental authorities will
consent to the transfer of all such permits. If the regulatory approvals required for such transfers are not


-----

obtained or are delayed, the foreclosure may be delayed, a temporary shutdown of operations may result
and the value of the Collateral may be significantly decreased.

**_Sufficiency of the Collateral—The Collateral may not be sufficient to secure the obligations under the Notes._**

The Notes and the guarantees thereof granted under the Indenture are secured by security interests
in the same Collateral that secures the obligations under the Senior Secured Term Loans, the Existing
Senior Secured Notes, certain hedging liabilities and certain cash management liabilities. The Collateral
may also secure additional debt to the extent permitted by the terms of the Indenture, the Existing Senior
Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement and the Intercreditor Deed, including
certain hedging obligations and cash management arrangements. Your rights as a holder of the Notes to
the Collateral would be diluted by any increase in the first-priority debt secured by the Collateral or a
reduction of the Collateral securing the Notes.

The value of the Collateral and the amount to be received upon a sale of such Collateral will
depend upon many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, the
condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers. The book value of
the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. All or a portion of
the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Likewise, we cannot assure
you that there will be a market for the sale of the Collateral, or, if such a market exists, that there will not
be a substantial delay in its liquidation. In addition, the share pledges of an entity may be of no value if that
entity is subject to an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding. The Collateral is located in a number of
countries, and the multi-jurisdictional nature of any foreclosure on the Collateral may limit the realizable
value of the Collateral. The Collateral will be released in connection with an enforcement sale pursuant to the
Intercreditor Deed.

**_Limitations on the value of the Collateral—The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the_**
**_assets that have been granted as security for the Notes._**

If there is an event of default on the Notes, the holders of the Notes will be secured only to the
extent of the value of the assets that have been granted as security for the Notes. Not all of the INEOS
Group’s assets secure the Notes. For example, in connection with Project ONE, we entered into project
financing agreements to fund the majority of the capital expenditure plus associated financing costs during
construction, which is secured by the Project ONE assets that will not form part of the Collateral that
secures the Notes. In addition, the assets of our Unrestricted Subsidiaries, including the entities that own
the Gemini assets and our Chinese joint venture interests, are not part of the Collateral. In addition, in the
future, the obligations to provide additional guarantees and grant additional security over assets, whether as
a result of the acquisition or creation of future assets or subsidiaries or otherwise, is subject to agreed
security principles under the Indenture and, in certain circumstances, indirectly through the Senior Secured
Term Loans Agreement, subject to certain other agreed security principles. To the extent that lenders
under the Senior Secured Term Loans are granted security, the negative pledge in the Indenture may require
such security to also be granted for the benefit of the holders of the Notes. The agreed security principles
set forth in the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement contain a number of limitations on the rights of the
lenders to be granted security in certain circumstances. The operation of the agreed security principles
may result in, among other things, the amount recoverable under any Collateral provided being limited or
security not being granted or perfected over a particular type or class of assets. Accordingly, the agreed
security principles may affect the value of the security provided by the Issuer and the Guarantors.

To the extent that the claims of the holders of the Notes exceed the value of the assets securing the
Notes and other obligations, those claims will rank equally with the claims of the holders of all other
existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness ranking pari passu with the Notes. As a result, if the
value of the assets pledged as security for the Notes is less than the value of the claims of the holders of the
Notes, those claims may not be satisfied in full before the claims of certain unsecured creditors are paid.

**_Challenges to Collateral—The grant of Collateral to secure the Notes might be challenged or voidable in an_**
**_insolvency proceeding._**

The grant of Collateral in favor of the Security Trustee may be voidable by the grantor or by an
insolvency trustee, liquidator, receiver or administrator or by other creditors, or may be otherwise set aside
by a court, or be unenforceable if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if
the grantor is deemed to be insolvent at the time of the grant, or if the grant permits the secured parties to
receive a greater recovery than if the grant had not been given and an insolvency proceeding in respect of the
grantor is commenced within a legally specified “clawback” period following the grant.


-----

For example, if certain Collateral were secured after the Issue Date and the grantor of such
security interest were to become subject to a bankruptcy or winding up proceeding after the Issue Date,
then any mortgage or security interest in Collateral delivered after the Issue Date would face a greater risk
than security interests in place on the Issue Date of being avoided by the grantor or by its trustee, receiver,
liquidator, administrator or similar authority, or otherwise set aside by a court, as a preference under
applicable insolvency law. In addition, the granting of shared security interests to secure future indebtedness
permitted to be secured on the Collateral may restart or reopen hardening periods for such security
interests in Germany or certain other jurisdictions, in particular as the Indenture permits the release and
retaking of security interests in certain circumstances. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is
voided, you would lose the benefit of the security interest. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability
_of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

**_Structural subordination—The Notes and each guarantee will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities and_**
**_any preferred stock of the non-Guarantor subsidiaries._**

Some, but not all, of our subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. Unless a subsidiary is a Guarantor
of the Notes, our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the Notes or to make
funds available for that purpose. Accordingly, you should only rely on the guarantees of the Notes to provide
credit support in respect of payments of principal or interest on the Notes.

Our operating subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and those of our subsidiaries that
do not guarantee the Notes (including our Unrestricted Subsidiaries) have no obligation, contingent or
otherwise, to pay any amounts due pursuant to the Notes or to make any funds available therefor, whether
by dividends, loans, distributions or other payments, and do not guarantee the payment of interest on, or
principal of, the Notes. Generally, claims of creditors of a non-Guarantor subsidiary, including trade
creditors, and claims of any preferred stockholders of the subsidiary, will have priority with respect to the
assets and earnings of the subsidiary over the claims of creditors of its parent entity, including claims against
IHL by the Issuer under the Notes Proceeds Loan, the Existing Senior Secured Notes Proceeds Loans and
the Senior Secured Term Loans Euro Proceeds Loans and by noteholders under the guarantees. In the event
of any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, reorganization, administration or other
bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of any of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries, the creditors of the
Guarantors (including the holders of the Notes) will have no right to proceed against such subsidiary’s
assets and holders of their indebtedness and their trade creditors and preferred stockholders will generally
be entitled to payment in full of their claims from the assets of those subsidiaries before any Guarantor, as
direct or indirect shareholder, will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary. As such,
the Notes, each guarantee, the Notes Proceeds Loan, the Existing Senior Secured Notes Proceeds Loans and
the Senior Secured Term Loans Euro Proceeds Loans are each structurally subordinated to the creditors
(including trade creditors) and any preferred stockholders of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries. For example,
in connection with Project ONE, we entered into project financing agreements to fund the majority of the
capital expenditure plus associated financing costs during construction. See “Description of Other
Indebtedness—Project ONE Facilities.” The indebtedness will be secured by the Project ONE assets and,
during the construction phase, supported by a debt service undertaking provided by IGH, IHL and INEOS
US I Inc. The Project ONE assets will not form part of the Collateral that secures the Notes and are all
held by non-Guarantors.

**_Decisions regarding Collateral—Holders of the Notes will not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral._**

No later than 90 days after the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured by the same Collateral that
secures the Senior Secured Term Loans and the Existing Senior Secured Notes. In addition, under the
terms of the Indenture, we will be permitted in the future to incur additional indebtedness and other
obligations that may share in the liens on the Collateral securing the Notes and the liens on the collateral
securing our other secured debt.

The Intercreditor Deed provides that a common security trustee, who will serve as the Security
Trustee for the secured parties under the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement, the Existing Senior
Secured Notes Indentures and the Indenture will (subject to certain limited exceptions) act with respect to
the Collateral only at the direction of creditors holding a simple majority of the aggregate amount of
outstanding first-priority secured debt (including the Notes, any additional notes, the Senior Secured Term
Loans, the Existing Senior Secured Notes, certain hedging liabilities, certain cash management liabilities
and any other senior secured notes or credit facilities that are permitted to be issued under the Indenture and
that the trustees or lenders in respect thereof accede to the Intercreditor Deed) and only such creditors
will be able to instruct the Security Trustee to enforce the security. No noteholder will have any separate right


-----

to enforce or to require the enforcement of the Collateral. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—
Intercreditor Deed.” As a result, the holders of the Notes will not be able to force a sale of such Collateral
or otherwise independently pursue the remedies of a secured creditor under the relevant security documents
for so long as any amounts under any other first priority senior secured debt (including the debt outstanding
under the Senior Secured Term Loans, the Existing Senior Secured Notes and any other senior secured
notes or debt that are permitted to be issued under the Indenture, and that the trustees or lenders in respect
thereof accede to, the Intercreditor Deed) remains outstanding in an amount equal to or greater than
50% of the aggregate principal amount of the total first-priority senior secured debt. The creditors under
the Senior Secured Term Loans and the holders of the Existing Senior Secured Notes may have interests that
are different from the interests of holders of the Notes and they may not elect to pursue their remedies
under the security documents at a time when it would otherwise be advantageous for the holders of the Notes
to do so.

In addition, if the Security Trustee sells the shares of our subsidiaries that have been pledged as
Collateral through an enforcement of their security interest in accordance with the Intercreditor Deed,
claims under the guarantees of the Notes by such subsidiaries and the liens over any other assets of such
subsidiaries securing the Notes and the guarantees may be released. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—
Intercreditor Deed” and “Description of the Notes—Security.”

It is possible that disputes may occur between the holders of the Notes, the holders of the Existing
Senior Secured Notes and the lenders under the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement as to the appropriate
manner of pursuing enforcement remedies with respect to the Collateral. In such an event, the holders of
the Notes will be bound by any decisions of the creditors holding a simple majority of the aggregate amount
of outstanding first-priority secured debt (including the Notes, any additional notes, the Existing Senior
Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Term Loans, certain hedging liabilities, certain cash management liabilities
and any other senior secured notes or credit facilities that are permitted to be issued under the Indenture
and that the trustees or lenders in respect thereof accede to the Intercreditor Deed), which may result in
enforcement actions against the Collateral that are not approved by the holders of the Notes or that may be
adverse to you. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Deed.”

Further, the security interests in the Collateral that will constitute security for the obligations of
the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes, but
rather to the Security Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes. The Indenture will also operate socalled “Parallel Debt” obligations to satisfy a requirement under the laws of Belgium, Germany, Switzerland
and France (and any other applicable jurisdictions with similar requirements) that the Security Trustee, as
grantee of certain types of Collateral, be a creditor of the relevant security provider or, in regard to Germany,
the secured claim. The Parallel Debt is in the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations
of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Indenture and the Notes (the “Principal Obligations”). Any
payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any
payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Although
the Security Trustee will have, pursuant to the Parallel Debt, a claim against the Issuer and the Guarantors for
the full principal amount of the Notes, holders of the Notes bear some risks associated with a possible
insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Trustee. In addition, there is no assurance that such a structure
will be effective before courts in the governing law jurisdictions of the security documents as there is no
judicial or other guidance as to its efficacy, and therefore the ability of the Security Trustee to enforce the
Collateral may be restricted. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the
Security Interests.”

Since German law does not generally permit the appropriation of pledged assets by the pledgee
upon the occurrence of an enforcement event, an enforcement of a pledge governed by German law (such
as, in particular, any pledges over shares in any German Guarantor) usually requires the sale of the relevant
collateral through a formal disposal process involving a public auction. Certain waiting periods and notice
requirements may apply to such disposal process. Thus, the disposal of pledged assets under German law will
be subject to statutory restrictions and may be delayed.

**_Release of Collateral and Guarantees—There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the_**
**_Notes under which the Collateral securing the Notes and the guarantees will be released automatically and under_**
**_which the guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, Collateral securing the Notes and the guarantees granted thereunder
will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged, including:


-----

- in connection with any sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition of such Collateral (other
than capital stock in Lux I) to a Person that is not the Parent, a Parent Intermediate Holdco (as
defined under “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions”), Lux I or a Restricted Subsidiary
(as defined under “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions”) or, subject to certain
requirements, to any other Person that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor, in each case, if the sale,
assignment, transfer or other disposition does not violate the requirements described under
“Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sale of Assets” or is otherwise
permitted by the Indenture;

- if such Collateral is an asset of a Guarantor (other than the Parent any Parent Intermediate
Holdco or Lux I) or any of its Subsidiaries (as defined under “Description of the Notes—
Certain Definitions”), in connection with any sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition of
capital stock of that Guarantor or Subsidiary (or of the capital stock of any direct or indirect
parent company of such Guarantor or Subsidiary, in each case, other than the Parent, any Parent
Intermediate Holdco, Lux I or the Issuer) as a result of which such Guarantor or such Subsidiary
ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary, if such sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition
does not violate the requirements of the covenant set forth under “Description of the Notes—
Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sale of Assets” or is otherwise permitted by the Indenture;

- in the case of any Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee (as defined under “Description
of the Notes—Certain Definitions”) pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, any Security

Deed or any additional intercreditor deed (which release shall be of the liens on the property
and assets, and capital stock, of such Guarantor);

- in connection with any Permitted Receivables Financing (as defined in the “Description of the
Notes—Certain Definitions”), which release shall be of the liens on receivable assets transferred
in connection therewith;

- if Lux I designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance
with the applicable provisions of the Indenture (which release shall be of the liens on the property
and assets, and capital stock, of such Restricted Subsidiary);

- upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as
described under “Description of the Notes—Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance of Indenture”
and “Description of the Notes—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

- as described under “Description of the Notes—Modifications and Amendments” and
“Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens”;

- in connection with an enforcement sale pursuant to or other sales contemplated and permitted
by the Intercreditor Deed;

- in the case of any Collateral (other than any capital stock in Lux I), upon written notice by
Lux I to the Trustee and the Security Trustee if the Collateral is intended to secure (A) Indebtedness
incurred under certain capital lease obligations or purchase money obligations or other
Indebtedness of the Parent, any Parent Intermediate Holdco, Lux I or any Restricted Subsidiary
incurred for the purpose of financing all or any part of the acquisition, development,
construction or improvement of real or personal, movable or immovable, property or assets
(including Capital Stock) used or to be used in the business of Lux I and its Restricted Subsidiaries,
or any refinancing of any such Indebtedness, or (B) Indebtedness incurred under any lines of
credit, bilateral facilities, working capital or overdraft facilities or other operating facilities
permitted to be incurred by the covenant described under “Description of the Notes—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”; provided that the Fair Market Value (as defined in
“Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions”) of all the Collateral released from liens under
this provision of the Indenture (excluding any portion thereof to the extent Liens thereon are
subsequently granted in favor of the Security Trustee, for the benefit of the holders of the Notes,
and with the Fair Market Value of any property or assets being measured at the time of the
release and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value) does not exceed €50.0 million
in the aggregate;

- in the case of any Escrowed Proceeds (as defined in “Description of the Notes—Certain
Definitions”), in accordance with the release provisions set forth in the applicable security
documents creating liens thereon;


-----

    - with respect to liens on any Proceeds Loan (as defined under “Description of the Notes—
Certain Definitions”), upon the payment in full or other discharge of such Proceeds Loan
(including as a result of any merger or consolidation of the payor or the payee thereunder);

     - to release and/or re-take any Lien on any Collateral to the extent otherwise permitted by the
terms of the Indenture, the security documents governing the Collateral or the Intercreditor Deed
or any additional intercreditor agreement;

    - to the extent set forth in “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Consolidation,
Merger, Sale of Assets”, in connection with any merger, consolidation, amalgamation, sale,
assignment, conveyance, transfer or other disposition made in compliance with the covenant
described under “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Consolidation, Merger, Sale
of Assets”;

    - in accordance with the covenant described under “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—
Impairment of Security Interests”;

     - with respect to all Collateral upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations
of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture;

    - in connection with a Permitted Reorganization (as defined in “Description of the Notes—
Certain Definitions”);

     - in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the
Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;

    - in connection with any inventory financing or similar arrangement incurred pursuant to
clause (22) of the definition of Permitted Indebtedness (as defined in “Description of the Notes—
Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”) (which release shall be of the Liens on the
inventory and related assets transferred in connection therewith);

     - if the Lien granted in favor of each of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Existing
Senior Secured Notes is released (only to the extent that there is no other Indebtedness secured
by a Lien on the assets constituting such Collateral that would result in the requirement for the
Notes and/or the Guarantees to be secured on such property or assets pursuant to the covenant
described under the caption “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
Liens”, it being understood that the foregoing limitation will not be applicable to the extent that
such Indebtedness is secured by a Permitted Lien, provided that, for the purposes of this
provision only, clauses (a) and (bb) of the definition of “Permitted Liens” in the “Description of
the Notes” shall not apply and clause (hh) of the definition of “Permitted Liens” in the
“Description of the Notes” shall not apply to any Indebtedness that was outstanding on the
Issue Date);

     - in connection with the funding of, or by, German pension trusts or in respect of sale and
leaseback transactions funded directly or indirectly by any such pension trusts;

    - with respect to Liens on any Capital Stock of INEOS Belgium (as defined in “Description of the

Restricted Subsidiaries that is not a Guarantor, any other Restricted Subsidiary that is not a
Guarantor or any Project Finance Entity (as defined in “Description of the Notes—Certain
Definitions”), in connection with incurrence of Indebtedness by any such Restricted Subsidiary
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or by any such Project Finance Entity; and

    - in the case of any Collateral, upon written notice by the Company to the Trustee and the
Security Trustee, if the release of the Lien on such Collateral is for bona fide purposes in
connection with any commercial transaction, so long as the Fair Market Value of the Collateral
being released does not exceed €2.5 million in the aggregate for any release or series of related
releases (as defined in “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions”).

Under various circumstances, guarantees will be automatically and unconditionally released and
terminated, including:

     - with respect to any Guarantor that is a Restricted Subsidiary of Lux I (a “Subsidiary Guarantor”),
in connection with any sale, assignment, transfer (including any transfer to certain joint ventures)
or other disposition (including by way of merger, consolidation or amalgamation) of all or
substantially all of the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor (determined after giving effect to


-----

any substantially concurrent sales, assignments, transfers or other dispositions to Lux I, a
Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary) to a person that is not (after giving effect to such
transaction or any related transaction) Lux I, a Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary, if such
sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition does not violate the requirements of the covenant
set forth under “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sale of Assets”;

    - with respect to any Subsidiary Guarantor, in connection with any sale, assignment, transfer
(including any transfer to certain joint ventures) or other disposition of the capital stock of such
Subsidiary Guarantor (or of the capital stock of any direct or indirect parent company of such
Subsidiary Guarantor (other than the Parent, any Parent Intermediate Holdco, Lux I or the Issuer)
that results in such Subsidiary Guarantor ceasing to be a Restricted Subsidiary, if such sale,
assignment, transfer or other disposition does not violate the requirements of the covenant set
forth under the heading “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sale of
Assets”;

    - with respect to any Subsidiary Guarantor, if such Subsidiary Guarantor is designated as an
“Unrestricted Subsidiary” in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

    - with respect to any Guarantor, as provided under “Description of the Notes—Certain

as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; provided that, after giving effect to such
release, the Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement) of
the Issuer and the Guarantors is at least 85% of the Consolidated EBITDA of the Parent,
Lux I and its Restricted Subsidiaries and the consolidated total assets of the Issuer and the
Guarantors is at least 85% of the consolidated total assets of the Parent, Lux I and its Restricted
Subsidiaries, in each case, calculated in accordance with, and in the manner provided by and
subject to the same exceptions as those set forth in, the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement
as in effect on the Issue Date (after giving effect to the modifications included in Exhibit L-1
thereto);

    - upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations of the Issuer under the
Notes and the Indenture; and

    - with respect to any Guarantor, upon written notice from Lux I to the Trustee, as part of any
Permitted Reorganization (as defined under “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions”).

**_Post-petition interest—The value of the Collateral securing the Notes may not be sufficient to secure post-_**
**_petition interest in the United States._**

In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or similar proceeding against
us in the United States, holders of the Notes will only be entitled to post-petition interest under the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code to the extent that the value of their security interest in the Collateral is greater than their prebankruptcy claim. Holders of the Notes that have a security interest in Collateral with a value equal or
less than their pre-bankruptcy claim will not be entitled to post-petition interest under the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code. No appraisal of the fair market value of the Collateral has been prepared in connection with the
Offering and therefore the value of the noteholders’ interest in the Collateral may not equal or exceed the
principal amount of the Notes.


-----

**_Controlling shareholders—The interests of our principal shareholders may conflict with your interests._**

Messrs. Ratcliffe, Currie and Reece own INEOS Limited, our ultimate parent holding company.
Mr. Ratcliffe controls INEOS Limited. Our controlling shareholder has power to elect all of the directors
of our companies, to change their management, to approve any changes to their organizational documents,
and to approve any acquisitions or dispositions. As a result, his actions can affect our strategic decisions,
including the payment of dividends the size of which may change or increase from time to time and may not
necessarily be in line with past practice, our legal and capital structure and our day-to-day operations. In
addition, our principal shareholders may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures or other
transactions, including repurchases of our debt, on the open market or otherwise, that, in their judgment,
could enhance their equity investment, even though these transactions might involve risks to you. In the
event of a conflict of interest between you and our principal shareholders, their actions could affect our
ability to meet our payment obligations to you.

**_Enforcement in multiple jurisdictions—Enforcing your rights as a noteholder or under the guarantees granted_**
**_under the Indenture or security across multiple jurisdictions may prove difficult._**

The Notes will be issued by the Issuer, a company incorporated under the laws of England and
Wales, and will be guaranteed by the Guarantors, which are incorporated or organized under the laws of
Belgium, Canada, England and Wales, Germany, Jersey, Luxembourg, Norway, Singapore, Switzerland and
certain states in the United States. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings
could be initiated in Belgium, England and Wales, Germany, Jersey, Luxembourg, Norway, Singapore,
Switzerland and certain states in the United States. Proceedings could also be initiated in Canada, France or
Scotland to enforce noteholders’rights against Collateral located in Canada, France or Scotland. Such multijurisdictional proceedings are likely to be complex and costly for creditors and otherwise may result in
greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of your rights. Your rights under the Notes, the
guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to the insolvency and administrative laws of several jurisdictions
and there can be no assurance that you will be able to effectively enforce your rights in such complex,
multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings.

In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of the Guarantors’
jurisdictions of organization may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other and those of
the United States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors,
ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceeding. These laws in certain jurisdictions
may limit the exercise of certain contractual rights (such as terminating an agreement, claiming an accelerated
payment or forfeiture of term under an agreement). Under these laws, the Trustee may be restricted and
prohibited from terminating the Indenture or declaring the Notes to be due and payable following an Event
of Default due to a Guarantor’s bankruptcy or insolvency. The application of these laws, or any conflict
among them, could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s law should apply, adversely affect
your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes, the guarantees and the security in those jurisdictions
or limit any amounts that you may receive. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees
and the Security Interests” with respect to certain of the jurisdictions mentioned above.

Moreover, in certain jurisdictions, including Germany, it is unclear whether all security interests in
the Collateral give the Security Trustee a right to prevent other creditors from foreclosing on and realizing
the Collateral or whether certain security interests only give the Security Trustee and the holders of the Notes
priority (according to their rank) in the distribution of any proceeds of such realization. Accordingly, the
Security Trustee and the holders of the Notes may not be able to avoid foreclosure by other creditors (including
unsecured creditors) on the Collateral.

The laws of certain of the jurisdictions in which the Guarantors are organized limit the ability of
these subsidiaries to guarantee debt of, or provide security for, other companies. See “Limitations on
Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”

**_Prior ranking security interests—Any creditors with prior ranking liens will have prior access to proceeds of_**
**_certain Collateral and your rights to enforce your security over the Collateral are limited._**

To the extent that holders of other secured debt or third parties enjoy liens (including statutory
liens) or other prior ranking security interests, whether or not permitted by the Indenture, such holders or
third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to certain Collateral securing the Notes and the
guarantees that, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy the obligations under the
Notes and the guarantees. In addition, certain security interests will, as a matter of local law, be granted as
junior ranking security interests in relation to the security granted in respect of the Senior Secured Term


-----

Loans and the Existing Senior Secured Notes. The existing first-ranking liens securing the Senior Secured
Term Loans and the Existing Senior Secured Notes that were created under Luxembourg, Norwegian and
New York law will remain in place and will extend to secure the Notes. In some jurisdictions, the Security
Documents creating the existing first-ranking liens securing the Senior Secured Term Loans and the Existing
Senior Secured Notes will be amended to extend such liens to the Notes (or, with respect to French and
certain of the German security, junior ranking security interests will be granted). The existing first-ranking
liens securing the Senior Secured Term Loans and the Existing Senior Secured Notes that were created
under English law, Scottish law, Jersey law and Singapore law will remain in place, and new liens over the
same Collateral will be created in these jurisdictions to secure the Notes. In these jurisdictions where new liens
are created, the ranking of these new liens relative to the existing liens will, as a matter of general law,
depend on a number of factors, such as the nature of the liens, the order of creation of the liens, compliance
with the jurisdiction’s perfection requirements with respect to the liens and the order of giving notices
with respect to the liens, and accordingly without the Intercreditor Deed, the new liens would be likely to
rank after the existing liens. Therefore, you may not be able to recover on such security interests or, in respect
of security interests under German law, accessory security interests, because the beneficiaries of the senior
ranking security interests will have a prior claim to all proceeds from the enforcement of the same, although
the Intercreditor Deed provides for certain pari passu rules of allocation agreed as between the parties to
it. See the specific local law security interests described under “Description of the Collateral and the
Guarantees—Summary of the Collateral and the Guarantees and Collateral for the Notes,” “Limitations
on Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees and the Security Interests” and “Description of Other
Indebtedness—Intercreditor Deed.”

**_Enforcement of French share pledges—Under the security interests governed by French law, you may be_**
**_required to pay a “soulte” in the event you decide to enforce the pledges of the shares by judicial or contractual_**
**_foreclosure of the Collateral consisting of shares of INEOS France SAS or INEOS Technologies France_**
**_SAS rather than by a sale of such Collateral in a public auction._**

Security interests governed by French law may only secure a creditor up to the secured amount
that is due and unpaid to it. The pledges over shares of French companies may be enforced at the option of
the secured creditor either by a sale of the pledged shares in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale
being paid to the secured creditors), by judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or by contractual
foreclosure (attribution conventionnelle) of the shares to the secured creditor, following which the secured
creditor is the legal owner of the pledged shares. If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of
foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or contractual foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed
extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed securities. A judge (in the context of a judicial foreclosure)
or an expert (in the context of a contractual foreclosure pre-contractually agreed or appointed by a judge),
will value the Collateral (in this case, the pledged shares) and if the value of the Collateral exceeds the amount
of secured debt, the secured creditors may be required to pay the obligor a soulte equal to the difference
between the value of the shares and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual
amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditors from a subsequent sale of the Collateral.

Consequently, in the event (i) the lenders under the Senior Secured Term Loans, the holders of the
Existing Senior Secured Notes or the holders of the Notes decide to, and are entitled to, enforce the share
pledges over the shares of INEOS France SAS and INEOS Technologies France SAS through a judicial or
contractual foreclosure and (ii) the value of such shares exceeds the amount of the secured debt, such
lenders under the Senior Secured Term Loans, the holders of the Existing Senior Secured Notes or the
holders of the Notes may be required to pay to the pledgor a soulte equal to the amount by which the value
of such shares exceeds the amount of secured debt.

If the value of such shares is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed
to the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such shares, and the remaining
amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured.

Security interests governed by French law may only secure payment obligations and may only be
enforced following a payment default (including following acceleration) and up to the secured amount that
is due and remaining unpaid.

**_Sufficiency of liens—We will not have the U.S. mortgage documents delivered at the Issue Date._**

In order to ensure that each of the U.S. mortgage liens secures the obligations under the Notes,
several of the mortgages already existing on the Issue Date may need to be amended and searches in the
real property records where the owned U.S. real property is located may need to be conducted. There can be


-----

no assurance as of the Issue Date that, among other things, (i) the U.S. mortgages definitively secure the
obligations under the Notes, (ii) the U.S. real property encumbered by each mortgage includes all of the
relevant U.S. property that it was intended to include, (iii) we own the rights to the owned properties that we
purport to own in each mortgage and that our title to such owned U.S. real property is not encumbered by
liens not permitted by the Indenture and (iv) no encroachments, adverse possession claims, or other
restrictions exist with respect to such owned U.S. real properties which could result in a material adverse
effect on the value or utility of such owned U.S. real properties.

**_Value of Collateral—The Collateral is subject to casualty risks._**

We intend to continue to maintain insurance or otherwise insure against hazards in the manner
described in this offering memorandum. There are, however, certain losses that may be either uninsurable
or not economically insurable, in whole or in part. Insurance proceeds may not compensate us fully for our
losses. If there is a complete or partial loss of any of the Collateral, the insurance proceeds may not be
sufficient to satisfy all of the secured obligations, including the Notes and the guarantees. In addition, even
if there is sufficient insurance coverage, if there is a total or partial loss of certain Collateral, there may be
significant delays in obtaining replacement Collateral.

**_Perfection of security interests—Your rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to_**
**_perfect security interests in the Collateral._**

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be
properly perfected, and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party or the
grantor, as applicable, of the security. The liens in the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected
with respect to the claims of the Notes if we fail or are unable, or the Security Trustee fails or is unable, to
take the actions we are or it is required, as the case may be, to take to perfect any of these liens. In addition,
applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security
interest, such as real property, equipment subject to a certificate and certain proceeds, can only be perfected
at or promptly following the time such property and rights are acquired and identified.

Prior to the renewal of certain registrations with the Belgian National Pledge Register on October 22,
2020 of security interests on the Belgian security, the liens on the Belgian security for the benefit of the
Senior Secured Term Loans, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the 2025 Senior Secured Notes and the
Schuldschein Loan did not constitute, as a matter of Belgian law, first-ranking liens due to the failure of the
security trustee under the Belgian security documents to renew certain registrations with the Belgian
National Pledge Register.

The Trustee and the Security Trustee will not monitor, or we may not comply with our obligations
to inform the Trustee or the Security Trustee of, any future acquisition of property and rights by us, and
the necessary action may not be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired property
or rights. Such failure may result in the invalidity of the security interest in the Collateral or adversely
affect the priority of the security interest in favor of the Notes against third parties. Neither the Trustee nor
the Security Trustee has any obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights by us
or the perfection of any security interest.

**_Guarantees and Collateral limitations—The guarantees and pledges of Collateral will be subject to certain_**
**_limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit_**
**_their validity and enforceability._**

The Indenture will provide that certain guarantees will be limited to the maximum amount that
can be guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor without rendering the relevant guarantee voidable or
otherwise ineffective under applicable law and enforcement of each guarantee would be subject to certain
generally available defenses. These laws and defenses include those that relate to corporate benefit, fraudulent
transfer or conveyance, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance
or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. See “Limitations on Validity
and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under fraudulent conveyance and
other laws, a court could subordinate or void the guarantees and, if payment had already been made under
a guarantee, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant Guarantor, if the court were to
find that:


-----

     - the relevant guarantee was incurred with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or
shareholders of the Guarantor or, in certain jurisdictions, even when the recipient was simply
aware that the Guarantor was insolvent when it granted the relevant guarantee;

     - the Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for the relevant
guarantee and the Guarantor was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant
guarantee; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant guarantee;
or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at
maturity;

    - the relevant guarantees were held to exceed the corporate objects of the Guarantor or not to be
in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor; or

    - the amount paid or payable under the relevant guarantee was in excess of the maximum amount
permitted under applicable law.

The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer, preference, transfer at undervalue
and other laws vary depending upon applicable governing law. Generally, an entity would be considered
insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness:

     - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, is greater than the fair value of all its assets;

     - the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay the probable
liability on its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they become due; or

     - it cannot pay its debts as they become due.

If a court were to find that the issuance of the Notes or a guarantee of the Notes was a fraudulent
conveyance, preference or transfer at undervalue or held it unenforceable for any other reason, the court
could hold that the payment obligations under the Notes or such guarantee are ineffective, or require the
holders of the Notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the Notes or such guarantee. In the event
of a finding that a fraudulent conveyance, preference or transfer at undervalue occurred, you may cease to
have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and, if
applicable, of the other Guarantors under any guarantees which have not been declared void.

Additionally, any future pledge of Collateral in favor of the Security Trustee, including pursuant to
security documents delivered after the date of the Indenture, might be avoidable by the pledgor (as debtorin-possession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy or similar official if certain events or circumstances exist or
occur, including, among others, if the pledgor is insolvent at the time of the pledge, the pledge permits the
holders of the Notes to receive a greater recovery than if the pledge had not been given and a bankruptcy
proceeding in respect of the pledgor is commenced within 90 days following the pledge, or in certain
circumstances, a longer period.

In addition, under the terms of the Indenture, we will be permitted in the future to incur additional
indebtedness and other obligations that may share in the liens on the Collateral securing the Notes and the
liens on the collateral securing our other secured debt. The granting of new security interests may require the
releasing and retaking of security or otherwise create new hardening periods in certain jurisdictions. The
applicable hardening period for these new security interests will run from the moment each new security
interest has been granted or perfected. At each time, if the security interest granted or recreated were to be
enforced before the end of the respective hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be
declared void or ineffective or it may not be possible to enforce it. Further, certain security documents
governing the security interests granted by the Guarantors will provide that the amounts guaranteed by
such security interests will be limited to the extent of the amount guaranteed by such Guarantor. Therefore,
limitations in the guarantees will also serve to limit the amounts guaranteed by the pledges of Collateral.

**_Insolvency laws—Relevant insolvency laws in England, Luxembourg and other jurisdictions may provide you_**
**_with less protection than U.S. bankruptcy law._**

The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of England and Wales.
Therefore, any insolvency proceedings by or against the Issuer or such Guarantors would likely be based on
English insolvency laws. IGH and certain of the other Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of
Luxembourg. Therefore, any insolvency proceedings by or against IGH or such other Guarantors would
likely be based on Luxembourg insolvency laws. The other Guarantors are incorporated or organized or have
assets located in Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Jersey, Norway, Scotland, Singapore, Switzerland
and the United States. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security


-----

Interests” for a description of the insolvency and similar laws in Luxembourg, Belgium, Canada, England
and Wales, France, Germany, Jersey, Norway, Scotland, Singapore, Switzerland and the United States, which
could limit the enforceability of the guarantees and the security interests.

The procedural and substantive provisions of the insolvency and similar laws in many of the
jurisdictions in which the Guarantors are organized are generally more favorable to secured creditors than
comparable provisions of U.S. law and afford debtors and unsecured creditors only limited protection from
secured creditors. The lenders under the Senior Secured Term Loans and the holders of the Existing
Senior Secured Notes have, and the holders of the Notes will have, first ranking security on substantially all
of the assets of IHL and substantially all of the assets of the Guarantors. As a result, after the enforcement
of the assets securing the Senior Secured Term Loans, the Existing Senior Secured Notes or the Notes, the
Senior Security Agent (as defined in the Intercreditor Deed) at the request of the senior creditors under
the Intercreditor Deed whose senior credit participations constitute the simple majority in aggregate principal
amount of the total senior credit participations will have effective control of and the right to direct the
disposition of the assets of IHL and those subsidiaries.

In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, the Guarantors, any future Guarantors, if any, or
any other of our subsidiaries experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in
which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency, corporate arrangement (if applicable) or similar proceedings
would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Guarantees and security provided by entities
organized in jurisdictions not discussed in this offering memorandum are also subject to material limitations
pursuant to their terms, by statute or otherwise. Any enforcement of the guarantees or security after
bankruptcy or an insolvency event in such other jurisdictions will be subject to the insolvency laws of the
relevant entity’s jurisdiction of organization or other jurisdictions. The insolvency and other laws of each of
these jurisdictions may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other, including in the areas
of rights of secured and other creditors, the ability to void preferential transfer, priority of governmental and
other creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceeding. The application
of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s laws
should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the guarantees or the security in
these jurisdictions and limit any amounts that you may receive.

**_Enforcement of civil liabilities—You may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law_**
**_violations._**

The Issuer and most of the Guarantors are companies incorporated outside the United States.
Most of our directors and executive officers and the directors and executive officers of the Guarantors are
non-residents of the United States. Although the Issuer and the Guarantors have submitted to the jurisdiction
of certain New York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to
effect service of process within the United States on our directors and executive officers or the directors and
executive officers of the Guarantors. In addition, as most of our assets and those of our directors and
executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce against them
judgments obtained in the U.S. courts predicated upon civil liability provisions of the Federal securities laws
of the United States. In addition, we have been informed that it is questionable whether certain non-U.S.
courts would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if proceedings were commenced in such non-U.S.
jurisdictions predicated solely upon U.S. Federal securities laws. See “Service of Process and Enforcement
of Judgments.”

**_Lack of public market—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to_**
**_sell your Notes may be limited._**

There is no existing market for the Notes. We cannot assure you as to:

     - the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

     - your ability to sell your Notes; or

     - the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Certain of the Initial Purchasers of the Notes have informed us that they intend to make a market
in the Notes after completing the Offering. However, the Initial Purchasers are not obligated to make a
market in the Notes and may cease market-making at any time. In addition, changes in the overall market
for high yield securities and changes in our financial performance or in the markets where we operate may


-----

adversely affect the liquidity of the trading market in these Notes and the market price quoted for these
Notes. As a result, we cannot assure you that an active trading market will actually develop for these Notes.

Historically, the markets for non-investment grade debt such as the Notes have been subject to
disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in their prices. Future trading prices for the Notes will
depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing interest rates, our operating results and
the market for similar securities. The market, if any, for the Notes may be subject to similar disruptions. Any
disruptions may have an adverse effect on the holders of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and
financial performance. As a result, there is no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the
Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your holding of the Notes at a fair
value, if at all.

Although an application will be made for the Notes to be listed on the Official List of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market, we cannot assure you
that the Notes will become or remain listed. Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes
as a result of the admission to trading on the Euro MTF Market, failure to be approved for listing or the
delisting of the Notes, as applicable, from the Official List may have a material effect on a holder’s ability to
resell the Notes in the secondary market.

In addition, the Indenture will allow the Issuer to issue additional Notes in the future which could
adversely impact the liquidity of the Notes.

**_Transfer of the Notes—The transfer of the Notes is restricted._**

The Notes and the guarantees thereof have not been registered under the Securities Act or the
securities laws of any jurisdiction and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold except pursuant to
an exemption from, or transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any
other applicable laws. See “Notice to Investors.” We have not agreed to or otherwise undertaken to register
any of the Notes, and we do not have any intention to do so. In addition, by acceptance of delivery of any
Notes, the holder thereof agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which it has
purchased the Notes that it shall not transfer the Notes in an aggregate principal amount of less than
$200,000, in the case of the Dollar Notes, or €100,000, in the case of the Euro Notes. It is your obligation to
ensure that your offers and sales of Notes comply with these transfer restrictions and applicable law.

**_Book-entry interests—Certain considerations relating to book-entry interests._**

Unless and until Notes in definitive registered form, or definitive registered notes, are issued in
exchange for book-entry interests, owners of book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders
of the respective Notes. The nominee of the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the
sole holder of the global notes representing the euro-denominated Notes, and the nominee for DTC will
be the sole holder of the global notes representing the dollar-denominated Notes. After payment to the
Paying Agent for onward payment to Euroclear and Clearstream or the DTC, as applicable, the Issuer will
have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of
book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest, you must rely on the procedures of
Euroclear, Clearstream or DTC, as applicable, and if you are not a participant in Euroclear, Clearstream or
the DTC, on the procedures of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights
of a holder under the Indenture. See “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form.”

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct
right to act upon the Issuer’s solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of
the relevant Notes. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the
extent you have received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear, Clearstream or the DTC. There can
be no assurance that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable you
to vote on any consents, requests for waivers or other actions on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Indenture, unless and until
definitive registered notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a book-entry interest,
you will be restricted to acting through Euroclear, Clearstream or the DTC, as applicable. The Issuer
cannot assure you that the procedures to be implemented through Euroclear, Clearstream or the DTC will
be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the relevant Notes. See “Book-Entry; Delivery and
Form.”

**_Foreign currency exchange risks—You may face currency exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Euro Notes are denominated and payable in euro, while the Dollar Notes are denominated and
payable in dollars. If you measure your investment returns by reference to a currency other than the currency
in which your Notes are denominated, investment in such Notes entails foreign currency exchange-related
risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the euro or the dollar, as
applicable, relative to the currency you use to measure your investment returns, caused by economic,
political and other factors which affect exchange rates and over which we have no control. Depreciation of
the currency in which your Notes are denominated against the currency by reference to which you measure
your investment returns would cause a decrease in the effective yield of such Notes below their stated
coupon rates and could result in a loss to you when the return on such Notes is translated into the currency
by reference to which you measure your investment returns. There may be tax consequences for you as a
result of any foreign currency exchange gains or losses resulting from your investment in the Notes. U.S.
investors with U.S. dollars as their functional currency may have important tax consequences as a result of
foreign exchange gains or losses, if any, as a result of investments in the Euro Notes. See “Certain Tax
Considerations—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.” You should consult your tax advisor
concerning the tax consequences to you of acquiring, holding and disposing of the Notes.

**_Interest rate risks—Certain of our borrowings bear interest at floating rates that could rise significantly,_**
**_increasing our interest cost and reducing cash flow._**

A substantial part of our indebtedness, including borrowings under the Senior Secured Term
Loans Agreement, bears or will bear interest at per annum rates depending on EURIBOR, SOFR and
similar benchmarks, in each case adjusted periodically, plus a spread. Furthermore, we may incur additional
indebtedness that bears interest at a floating rate. These interest rates could rise significantly in the future,
thereby increasing our interest expenses associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for
capital expenditures and hindering the Issuer’s ability to make payments on the Notes.

**_Changes or uncertainty in respect of EURIBOR, SOFR or other interest rate benchmarks may affect our_**
**_sources of funding, increasing our interest cost and reducing cash flow._**

Some of our sources of funding are linked to EURIBOR, SOFR or other interest rate benchmarks.
See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Senior Secured Term Loans.” Various interest rate benchmarks
are the subject of recent national and international regulatory guidance and proposals for reform, including
the EU Benchmarks Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/1011). The Bank of England has established the
Sterling Over Night Index Average rate (SONIA) as the primary sterling interest rate benchmark in
replacement of sterling LIBOR, and the publication of the one-week and two-month LIBOR for U.S.
dollars ceased immediately after December 31, 2021. In addition, immediately after June 30, 2023, publication
of the overnight and 12-month LIBOR for U.S. dollars and the one-month, three-month and six-month
LIBOR for U.S. dollars were discontinued, except, in the case of one-month, three-month and six-month
LIBOR for U.S. dollars, on a synthetic basis through September 2024. As a result of these developments, the
Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement was amended in November 2022 to accommodate the phase-out
of LIBOR for U.S. dollars. Any further significant change to the setting or existence of EURIBOR, SOFR
or other interest rate benchmarks could affect the ability of amounts available to us to meet our obligations
under our sources of funding or could have a material adverse effect on the value or liquidity of, and the
amount payable under, our sources of funding, including our ability to make payments on the Notes. The
discontinuation of or changes in the manner of administration of EURIBOR, SOFR or other interest rate
benchmarks could result in adjustment to the conditions applicable to our sources of funding or other
consequences as relevant to our sources of funding including, without limitation, early redemption,
discretionary valuation, delisting or other consequences. No assurance can be provided that relevant changes
will not be made to EURIBOR, SOFR or any other relevant benchmark rate or that such benchmarks
will continue to exist. Furthermore, under the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement, the administrative
agent and the borrowers are required to endeavor to amend the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement to
replace EURIBOR or SOFR with a replacement benchmark rate in certain circumstances such as if the
administrator of EURIBOR or SOFR or the supervisor for the administrator of EURIBOR or SOFR
announces that such administrator has ceased or will cease to provide the applicable benchmark rate,
permanently or indefinitely, or if the supervisor for the administrator of EURIBOR or SOFR announces a
specific date after which EURIBOR or SOFR shall no longer be used for determining interest rates for
loans denominated in the applicable currency.

**_The Group may incur additional indebtedness, which indebtedness could increase its leverage and may have_**
**_terms that are more or less favorable than the terms of the Group’s existing indebtedness._**

The Group or its subsidiaries may incur substantial additional debt. Prior to the maturity of the
Notes, we will be required to refinance or repay certain other debt, including our obligations under the
Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement and the Existing Indentures. In connection with the Group’s financial
strategy, the Group continually evaluates different financing alternatives, and the Group may decide to
enter into new credit facilities, access the debt capital markets or incur other indebtedness from time to time.
Any such offering or incurrence of debt will be made at the Group’s election or the election of its relevant
subsidiaries, and if such debt is in the form of securities, would be offered and sold pursuant to, and on the
terms described in, an additional offering memorandum. The interest rate with respect to any such
additional debt will be set at the time of the pricing or incurrence of such debt and may be less than or
greater than the interest rate applicable to the Group’s existing debt, including, in the case of a refinancing,
the debt that is being refinanced, which would have a corresponding effect on the Group’s net cash
interest expense on a pro forma basis. In addition, the maturity date of any such additional debt will be set
at the time of pricing or incurrence of such debt and may be earlier or later than the maturity date of the
Group’s existing debt. The other terms of such additional debt would be as agreed with the relevant
lenders or holders thereof and could be more or less favorable than the terms of the Group’s existing
indebtedness. There can be no assurance that the Group will elect to raise any such additional debt or that
any effort to raise such debt will be successful, and there can be no assurance as to the timing of such offering
or incurrence, the amount or terms of any such additional debt. If the Group incurs new debt in addition
to its current debt, the related risks that the Group now faces, even in a refinancing transaction, as described
above and elsewhere in these “Risk Factors,” could intensify. If we are unable to obtain new debt financing
as needed, we would have to consider other options, such as selling assets; restructuring all or a portion
of our debt before maturity; obtaining additional equity capital; foregoing opportunities such as acquisitions;
or reducing or delaying our business activities and capital investments. For example, in connection with
Project ONE, we entered into project financing agreements to fund the majority of the capital expenditure
plus associated financing costs during construction. The indebtedness is secured by the Project ONE assets,
that will not form part of the Collateral that secures the Notes, and, during the construction phase,
supported by a debt service undertaking provided by IGH, IHL and INEOS US I Inc. In addition, in
connection with our acquisition of the SECCO joint venture interest, our Unrestricted Subsidiary, INEOS
China Holdings Limited, incurred RMB 1,045 million and $785.0 million of indebtedness, which is also
guaranteed by IHL and IGH. See also “Description of Other Indebtedness—Project ONE Facilities” and
“Description of Other Indebtedness—Rain Facilities.”

**_Certain covenants may be suspended upon the occurrence of a change in the ratings of the Notes._**

The Indenture will provide that, if at any time following the date of the Indenture, the Notes satisfy
the Investment Grade Requirement (as defined under “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions”)
and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, then beginning on that day and continuing
until such time, if any, at which the Investment Grade Requirement ceases to be satisfied, certain covenants
will automatically cease to be applicable to the Notes and release the guarantees of the Notes (other than
the guarantees of any parent of the Issuer). See “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension of
Covenants and Release of Guarantees on Achievement of Investment Grade Status.” If these covenants
were to cease to be applicable, we would be able to incur additional debt or make payments, including
dividends or investments, which may conflict with the interests of holders of the Notes. There can be no
assurance that the Notes will ever achieve an investment grade rating or that any such rating will be
maintained.


-----

**THE TRANSACTIONS**

We intend to use the proceeds from the Offering, along with the proceeds from the New Senior
Secured Term Loans, (i) to refinance a portion of existing secured debt up to €640,000,000; (ii) to pay the
purchase price of US$700 million for the acquisition of LyondellBasell’s ethylene oxide and derivatives
business and the aggregate purchase price of €400 million for an INEOS affiliate’s and TotalEnergies’ cracker

related fees and expenses are collectively referred to herein as the “Transactions.”

We are carrying out the Transactions in order to extend our debt maturity profile, finance the
Bayport Acquisition and the Lavéra Acquisition and improve our liquidity. Please see “Description of
Other Indebtedness.”

portion of existing secured debt up to €640,000,000; (ii) to pay the purchase price of US$700 million for
the acquisition of LyondellBasell’s ethylene oxide and derivatives business and the aggregate purchase price
of €400 million for an INEOS affiliate’s and TotalEnergies’ cracker and derivative assets in Lavéra,

(1) Working capital represents net current assets (current assets less current liabilities).
(2) Total interest-bearing loans and borrowings represents net loans and borrowings after deducting debt issuance costs as presented
in note 19 to each of the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and note 11 to the Unaudited Interim Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.
(3) Total indebtedness represents gross non-current interest-bearing loans and borrowings plus gross current interest-bearing loans
and borrowings before deduction of unamortized debt issuance costs. Under IFRS, debt issuance costs are deducted from the
related debt amounts for the purposes of balance sheet presentation and are amortized over the life of the debt. See “Presentation
of Financial and Non-IFRS Information.”
(4) Net debt represents total indebtedness less cash and cash equivalents. See “Presentation of Financial and Non-IFRS Information.”
(5) EBITDA before exceptionals represents profit for the period before net finance costs or income, tax charges or credits, depreciation,
amortization and impairment, share of profit/(loss) of associates and joint ventures using the equity accounting method, profit/
(loss) on disposal of investments, profit/(loss) on disposal of fixed assets, and exceptional items as defined in the Consolidated
Financial Statements. In accordance with IFRS, we use both the FIFO and weighted average cost methods of accounting for
purposes of determining our inventory cost in connection with the preparation of our audited annual consolidated financial
statements. EBITDA before exceptionals is based on the FIFO and weighted average cost methods of accounting for inventory used
in connection with the preparation of such financial information. EBITDA before exceptionals is derived from income statement
line items calculated in accordance with IFRS on a historical cost basis. Although our EBITDA-based measures should not be
considered a substitute measure for operating profit, profit, cash flows from operating activities or other measures of performance
as defined by IFRS, we believe that they provide useful information regarding our ability to meet future debt service requirements.
The EBITDA-based measure presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. See
“Presentation of Financial and Non IFRS Information.” EBITDA before exceptionals includes the impact of IFRS 16 Leases.
Excluding the impact of IFRS 16 Leases (of €241.2 million, reflecting €180.8 million in respect of the payment of the capital
element of lease liabilities and €60.4 million in respect of interest expense payable on lease liabilities for the 12-month period ended
September 30, 2023), our EBITDA before exceptionals for the 12-month period ended September 30, 2023 is €1,384.5 million.
See “Presentation of Financial and Non-IFRS Information.”

(6) Net cash interest expense comprises interest payable on senior notes, interest payable on bank loans and overdrafts and interest
payable on securitization, less interest income on bank balances (2022: €27.0 million, 2021: €1.0 million, 2020: €2.5 million,
nine-month period ended September 30, 2023: €61.3 million, nine-month period ended September 30, 2022: €10.0 million, 12-month
period ended September 30, 2023: €78.3 million). See “Presentation of Financial and Non-IFRS Information.”
(7) Capital expenditures represents payments to acquire property, plant and equipment as recorded on the consolidated cash flow
statements for the periods indicated.

**Overview**

We are one of the world’s largest chemical companies as measured by revenue. Our business has
highly integrated world class chemical facilities and production technologies. We have leading global market
positions for a majority of our key products and a strong and stable customer base. We currently operate
34 manufacturing sites in seven countries throughout the world. We are led by a highly experienced
management team with, on a combined basis, over 100 years of experience in the chemical industry. As of
September 30, 2023, our total chemical production capacity was approximately 25,000 kta, of which 57% was
in Europe and 43% was in North America.

We operate our business through three segments: Olefins & Polymers Europe, Olefins & Polymers
North America and Chemical Intermediates. The products we manufacture are derived from crude oil and
natural gas, and include olefins, polymers and various petrochemical products directly or indirectly derived
from olefins. Our products serve a broad and diverse range of end markets, including packaging,
construction, automotive, white goods/durables, agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals.

Our highly integrated, world class production facilities and technological know-how allow us to
process raw materials into higher value-added products. In Europe, we own two sites integrated with
crackers and polymer units. Typically, these two sites account for approximately 76% of our European
olefin and polymer volumes. The polyolefins plants on our two major sites in Europe normally receive more
than 95% of their feedstock supply from our integrated crackers. Following the completion of the Lavéra
Acquisition, we will also own the Naphtachimie steam cracker, which is one of Europe’s largest with a
capacity of 720 ktpa of ethylene. This cracker is integrated with the downstream derivative plants which make
up the Lavéra Businesses. Similarly, in the United States, much of our olefin feedstock requirements for
our polymer business is supplied by either our Chocolate Bayou cracker in Texas or by integrated third-party
facilities, such as the Tesoro facility in Carson, California. The Bayport Acquisition site in Bayport, Texas,
USA is also integrated with third-party facilities. We believe that with our highly integrated facilities we are
able to capture attractive margins across the value chain, enjoy greater certainty of feedstock supply,
reduce logistical costs, improve energy management and optimize our product slate.

We benefit from the cost advantages of operating large scale, well invested, highly integrated
facilities strategically located near major transportation facilities and customer locations. Since January 1,
2007, we and our predecessors have invested approximately €12 billion (including investments in divested
assets) in our production facilities to ensure that they operate efficiently, resulting in integrated, and state
of the art production units. This includes significant investments of almost €3.6 billion in the last five years
to further enhance our assets’ capabilities. We believe these investments allow us to operate at lower cost


-----

and higher utilization rates than most of our competitors, and enable us to maintain positive margin and
cash flows even during downturns in industry cycles or customer demand. For the 12-month period ended
September 30, 2023, our revenue was €15.5 billion and our EBITDA before exceptionals was €1.6 billion.

Over the past several years, we have implemented a range of strategic initiatives designed to lower
our operating costs, increase our profitability and further enhance our market position. These include fixed
asset investments to expand our capacity in higher value products, to enhance productivity at our existing
facilities, and to reduce our fixed cost structure through headcount reductions, production line closures and
system upgrades. In addition, we have shifted our product portfolio to focus on more differentiated
products, exited low-margin businesses and implemented premium pricing strategies designed to improve
our margins. We believe these initiatives provide us with a strong platform to drive growth, create significant
operating leverage and position us to benefit from volume recovery in our end markets.

Since April 1998, when INEOS was established with the acquisition of the Belgian “Oxide” assets
from Inspec plc, we have significantly expanded, both through a series of strategic acquisitions of businesses
and assets from major chemical companies, and through organic growth. The combination of INEOS and
Innovene in December 2005 represented a transformational milestone for our company, providing global
scale and further upstream integration.

In 2011, we transferred our Refining Business, our Entrepreneurial (Refining) Business and certain
infrastructure assets to three joint ventures outside the INEOS Group. Please see “Business—Refining
Divestiture, Grangemouth Divestiture and Lavéra Divestiture—The Refining Divestiture” for a further
description of the disposal of our Refining Business and Entrepreneurial (Refining) Business.

In 2013, we completed the Grangemouth Divestiture to a newly created subsidiary of INEOS
Holdings AG, our indirect parent company. See “Business—Refining Divestiture, Grangemouth Divestiture
and Lavéra Divestiture—The Grangemouth Divestiture.”

In 2014, we divested the olefins and polymers assets and Chemical Intermediates assets of the
Lavéra site. See “Business—Refining Divestiture, Grangemouth Divestiture and Lavéra Divestiture—The
Lavéra Divestiture.”

In 2015, we completed the purchase of the remaining 50% interest in the Noretyl ethylene cracker
at Rafnes, Norway from the INOVYN group (formerly the Kerling Group), a related party. In 2015, we
also acquired aromatics and cumene assets from Axiall Corporation. The acquisition comprised the world’s
largest cumene plant in Pasadena, Texas. In addition, Axiall’s phenol, acetone and alpha-methylstyrene
business was transferred to the INEOS phenol facility at Mobile, Alabama.

In 2016, the Group acquired 100% of the shares of WLP Holding Corporation, one of the largest
high density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe manufacturers in North America. Moreover, in 2016, following a
strategic review of the INEOS Technologies business, we decided to cease marketing its polyolefins licensing
technology externally and to transfer the remaining parts of the INEOS Technologies business to existing
businesses within the Group to provide a clearer focus on individual product lines.

In 2019, the Group acquired the INESCO combined heat and power plant at the Antwerp site in
Belgium.

In December 2020, the Group acquired the remaining 50% interest in the Gemini HDPE joint
venture from Sasol Chemicals. The principal activity of the company is the production of high density
polyethylene in La Porte, Texas, United States. The acquisition increased the Group’s interest in Gemini to
100% through Unrestricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the Indentures and the Senior Secured Term Loans
Agreement). Prior to the acquisition the Group reflected its 50% interest in Gemini as a joint venture. A
Restricted Subsidiary (as defined in the Indentures and the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement) of the
Group is the operator of the facility and has the exclusive right to supply Gemini with the required
components necessary for the production of a specified quantity of the HDPE products and to take such
quantity of the HDPE products and, as compensation, pays a toll fee. See “Description of Other
Indebtedness—Gemini HDPE Term Loans.”

In December 2021, the Group acquired the assets of Charter Plastics in Titusville, United States, a
manufacturer of high density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe products.

In the summer of 2022, the Group began construction of a new ethane steam cracker in Antwerp,
Belgium, for the production of ethylene with a nameplate capacity of approximately 1,450 kta, along with
associated utilities, tankage and infrastructure (“Project ONE”). We believe Project ONE is the largest


-----

investment in the European chemicals industry for the past 20 years and we expect it to be among the most
efficient and sustainable of its kind. It is planned to be equipped with the best available technologies with
a high efficiency in use of raw materials and energy, CO2 emissions that are expected to be less than half of
the currently best performing similar units in Europe from the outset and a clear path to carbon neutrality
on a Scope 1 and Scope 2 basis within 10 years of start-up of the cracker. See also “Other Recent
Developments,” “Risk Factors—Future acquisitions or developments—Any future acquisitions or
developments may prove difficult for us to consummate,” “Risk Factors—Litigation—We are subject to
certain risks related to litigation filed by or against us, and adverse results may harm our business” and
“Business—Facilities—Project ONE.”

In December 2022, the Group acquired for approximately RMB 10.5 billion, through an
Unrestricted Subsidiary, a 50% interest in the Shanghai SECCO Petrochemical Company Limited facility
in Shanghai, China (“SECCO”). The remaining 50% is owned by Sinopec and its affiliates. SECCO has a
capacity of 4,200 kta of petrochemicals, including ethylene, propylene, polyethylene, polypropylene, styrene,
polystyrene, acrylonitrile, butadiene, benzene and toluene. In August 2023, the Group acquired, through
an Unrestricted Subsidiary, 50% interest in a joint venture with Sinopec which now holds a new petrochemical
complex in Tianjin, China currently under construction by Sinopec (the “Tianjin Nangang Ethylene
**Project”). The Tianjin Nangang Ethylene Project is expected to be on-stream in the second half of 2024**
and includes a new 500 kta HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene) plant.

On March 31, 2023, the Group completed the acquisition of the entire asset base of Mitsui
Phenols Singapore Ltd from Mitsui Chemicals for a total consideration of $273.0 million, which was
funded by cash on hand. The acquisition comprised the entire asset base of Mitsui Phenols on Jurong
Island, Singapore, which has more than 1,000 ktpa of capacity, including for cumene, phenol, acetone, alphamethylstyrene and bisphenol A. This acquisition allows us to support our global customers more effectively,
developing new markets and relationships in Asia.

In July 2023, affiliates of the Group announced their intention to acquire TotalEnergies’ 50% share
of Naphtachimie (720 ktpa steamcracker), Appryl (300 ktpa polypropylene business), Gexaro (270 ktpa
aromatics business) and 3TC (naphtha storage), currently 50:50 joint ventures between TotalEnergies and
the Lavéra Businesses. The acquisition includes other infrastructure assets associated with the site, including
full ownership of the southern sections of TotalEnergies’ ethylene pipeline network running from Lavéra
to the Lyon region. A 50% share of the central and northern sections, from the Lyon region to the Lorraine
region, will be held equally TotalEnergies and an affiliate of the Group. A binding sale and purchase
agreement (subject to customary conditions to completion) was signed in October 2023. The Group will,
immediately prior to the acquisition of the TotalEnergies Lavéra Business, complete the Lavéra
Reorganization, following which the acquisition of the TotalEnergies Lavéra Business will occur within the
Group. The Lavéra Acquisition is subject to regulatory approval and satisfaction of other customary
closing conditions and is expected to be completed in the first half of 2024.

In December 2023, the Group agreed with LyondellBasell to acquire its Ethylene Oxide and
Derivatives business, including the Bayport Underwood site in Texas, USA for $700 million, which includes
a 420 kt Ethylene Oxide plant, a 375 kt Ethylene Glycols plant, a 165 kt Glycol Ethers plant and all
associated third-party activities on the site. The Bayport Acquisition is expected to be completed in the
second quarter of 2024, subject to regulatory and other third-party approvals and satisfaction of other
customary closing conditions.

**_Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations_**

Our results of operations are driven by a combination of factors affecting the petrochemical and
chemical intermediate markets generally, including general economic conditions, prices of raw materials,
global supply and demand for our products and environmental legislation, including climate change initiatives.
Our results of operations are also impacted by company-specific structural and operational factors. Set
forth below is an overview of the key drivers that have affected the historical results of operations, and are
expected to affect our future results of operations.

_Supply and Demand in the Petrochemical Industry_

Margins in the petrochemical industry are strongly influenced by industry utilization. As demand
for petrochemical products approaches available supply, utilization rates rise, and prices and margins
typically increase. Historically, this relationship has been highly cyclical due to fluctuations in supply resulting
from the timing of new investments in capacity and general economic conditions affecting the relative


-----

strength or weakness of demand. Generally, capacity is more likely to be added in periods when current or
expected future demand is strong and margins are, or are expected to be, high. Investments in new capacity
can result, and in the past frequently have resulted, in overcapacity, which typically leads to a reduction of
margins. In response, petrochemical producers typically reduce capacity or limit further capacity additions,
eventually causing the market to be relatively undersupplied.

After a sharp drop in operating rates as a result of demand destruction during the COVID-19
pandemic, and excessive capacity addition in Asia, NexantECA’s analysis of the global supply and demand
for ethylene indicates that the rate of capacity addition will exceed consumption growth in the near term.
Operating rates fell by three percentage points to 87% in 2020, remained flat at this level through 2021, and
were further depressed by heavy capacity addition and weak demand growth in 2022. While the effect of
higher energy, commodity and borrowing costs resulting from the conflict in Ukraine was mostly negative
regarding demand for ethylene derivatives in 2022, the withdrawal of Western technology licensors from
Russia has significantly reduced near-term capacity growth in Russia. NexantECA forecasts that capacity
addition peaked in 2022, and capacity addition over 2024-2025 will be around 50 percent lower. NexantECA
notes that the pressure on operating rates and margins will be more severe in Asia, where the capacity
addition is concentrated, than in Europe or the United States. Nevertheless, the rate of margin recovery in
the petrochemical industry is highly dependent on the actual speed of global macro-economic growth. In
addition to the global petrochemical cycle, margins are also susceptible to potentially significant swings in
the short term. This volatility, which may be global or isolated in individual regions, can be caused by a
number of factors, including fluctuations in utilization rates due to planned or unplanned plant outages,
political and economic conditions driving rapid changes in prices for key feedstocks, exchange rate
fluctuations and changes in inventory management policies by petrochemical customers (such as inventory
building or de-stocking in periods of expected price increases).

_Asset Utilization_

Our results of operations are materially influenced by the degree to which we utilize our assets in
order to achieve maximum production volumes. As a low-cost producer, we believe in operating our
facilities at full capacity. We believe this allows us to maintain positive margins and cash flows, even during
downturns in industry cycles or customer demand, more readily than some of our competitors who have
higher production costs. We intend to achieve growth in production volume by improving utilization rates
within the defined availability of an asset, improving availability of an asset by minimizing planned and
unplanned facility downtime and improving capacity of an asset through de-bottlenecking projects.

For example, the number and length of turnarounds (scheduled outages of a unit in order to
perform necessary inspections and testing to comply with industry regulations and to permit us to carry
out any maintenance activities that may be necessary) carried out in any given period can impact operating
results.

When possible, we seek to schedule the timing of turnarounds to coincide with periods of relatively
low demand for the products of the relevant units. Olefins crackers typically undergo major turnarounds
every four or five years, with each turnaround lasting four to six weeks. Turnarounds for polymers and
derivatives units are more frequent, typically every one to two years, but generally last only seven to 10 days.
Likewise, unplanned outages, such as the incident on a pipeline in Chocolate Bayou in 2023, the freezing
weather conditions in Texas during the latter part of the first quarter of 2021 and the outages at our Green
Lake and Seal Sands sites in 2019, can impact our operating results, even if such outages are covered by
insurance. Similarly, planned or unplanned outages of our competitors can positively affect our operating
results by decreasing the supply of product in the market.

_Oil and Gas Price Movements_

Feedstock costs are a significant component of the operating costs of our petrochemical business.
The costs of the feedstocks we require to make our petrochemical products (naphtha, ethane, butane and
propane) are principally driven by the price of oil and natural gas. According to the U.S. Energy
Administration, the spot price for Brent crude oil decreased from approximately $92 per barrel in
January 2008 to approximately $78 per barrel in December 2023, while the natural gas Citygate price in
Texas decreased from $8.23 per thousand cubic feet in January 2008 to $3.78 per thousand cubic feet in
October 2023. During 2022 the crude oil price rapidly increased, reaching a high of approximately $123 per
barrel in June before finishing the year at approximately $81 per barrel as compared to approximately
$74 per barrel at the end of 2021. During 2023 the crude oil price reached a high of approximately $94 per
barrel in September before finishing the year at approximately $78 per barrel as compared to approximately


-----

$81 per barrel at the end of 2022. The average price of crude oil, and thus the price of petrochemical
products, increased to an average of approximately $101 per barrel in 2022 as compared to an average of
approximately $82 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Our ability to pass on price increases for crude is limited due to the impact of time lags resulting
from the repricing intervals of our contracts with suppliers and customers, particularly in the petrochemical
business. While most of our feedstock contracts reprice daily, our contracts with customers generally
reprice on a monthly basis. A further limitation is that many of our customers take advantage of fluctuating
prices by building inventories when they expect product prices to increase and reducing inventories when
they expect prices to decrease. The effect of these time lags and our customers’inventory management policies
on our ability to pass through feedstock price increases is magnified in periods of high volatility. In
addition, changes in oil and gas prices have a direct impact on our working capital levels and on inventory
losses, especially in the event of a sudden decrease in oil and gas prices. While negatively affecting our EBITDA
before exceptionals, these inventory losses and cost of sales adjustments are non-cash in nature. In general,
increases in feedstock prices lead to an increase in our working capital and decreases in feedstock prices lead
to a decrease in our working capital.

_Implementation of Cost Reduction_

We have historically focused on implementing our strategies of reducing costs by making rapid
reductions in underlying fixed costs and implementing an efficient corporate and management structure
and maximizing the utilization of our assets. Our ability to continue to reduce costs will impact, among other
things, our profitability and capacity plans.

_Debt Structure_

As of September 30, 2023, we had €10,302.3 million (including €508.3 million of debt under the
Gemini HDPE term loan facility and €878.6 million of debt under the Rain Facilities) (December 31, 2022:
€8,877.6 million (including €521.0 million under the Gemini HDPE term loan facility and €632.8 million
under the Rain Facilities) of outstanding indebtedness. Our future results of operations, and in particular our
net finance charges, will be significantly affected by the amount of our outstanding indebtedness, including
the interest we pay on our indebtedness. The servicing of this indebtedness will impact, among other
things, our cash flows and our cash balance.

In February 2023, the Group issued €400.0 million Senior Secured Notes due 2028 and
$425.0 million Senior Secured Notes due 2028 and new euro-denominated Senior Secured Term Loans of
€700.0 million and U.S. dollar-denominated Senior Secured Term Loans of $1,200.0 million.

As part of the Group’s purchase of the 50% interest in the SECCO joint venture in Shanghai, China
from Sinopec on December 31, 2022, the Group entered into the Rain Facilities, consisting of term loan
facilities of RMB 1,045 million and $525.0 million, maturing June 2026. In April 2023, the Group successfully
completed a syndication of the term loan facilities. As part of the syndication, which increased the
number of lenders to 10, the term loan facilities were increased to RMB 1,045 million and $785.0 million.

In addition, on December 22, 2022, the Group entered into project financing agreements in
connection with Project ONE to borrow loans of up to €3.5 billion under the Project ONE Facilities to
fund the majority of the capital expenditure plus associated financing costs during construction. On July 20,
2023 the Group received a decision from the Council for Permit Disputes annulling the permit for Project
ONE. As a result of the annulment of the permit, further drawings were suspended from that date. On
January 7, 2024, a new permit was issued. We expect the drawstop to be lifted on or around February 22,
2024, the date that is 45 days after the new permit was granted. In September 2023, the Group entered
into the Project ONE Interim Facility providing for loans in an aggregate principal amount of €400 million
which is partially guaranteed by Gigarant (a special purpose vehicle of the Flemish government). This is a
short dated facility repayable within 364 days. The Group expects to repay the Project ONE Interim Facility
from borrowings under the Project ONE Facilities once the drawstop is lifted.

In November 2022, the Group raised €800 million of Senior Secured Term Loans which were
partly used to redeem a portion of the euro-denominated Senior Secured Term Loans due 2024. Additionally
the Group raised $1.2 billion of Senior Secured Term Loans which were partly used to redeem a portion
of the U.S. dollar-denominated Senior Secured Term Loans due 2024. In November 2021, the Group raised
€1.1 billion of Senior Secured Term Loans which were used to fully redeem the outstanding Senior Notes
due 2024.


-----

In December 2020, as part of the Group’s purchase of the remaining 50% interest in the Gemini
HDPE plant in Texas, United States, from Sasol Chemicals the Group amended and upsized the existing
Gemini Term Loan facility within the acquired legal entity, an Unrestricted Subsidiary. The amended loan
facility was upsized to $600 million and the maturity extended to October 31, 2027. A Restricted Subsidiary
of the Group is the operator of the HDPE plant and has the exclusive right to supply Gemini with the
required components necessary for the production of a specified quantity of the HDPE products and to
take such quantity of the HDPE products and, as compensation, pays a toll fee. See “Description of Other
Indebtedness—Gemini HDPE Term Loans.”

In October 2020, the Group issued €325 million Senior Secured Notes due March 2026 and new eurodenominated Senior Secured Term Loans of €375 million which mature on October 27, 2027.

_Foreign Exchange Rate Fluctuations_

Our results of operations may be affected by both the transaction effects and translation effects of
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. A substantial portion of our revenue is generated in, or linked
to, the U.S. dollar and euro. In our European petrochemical business, product prices, certain feedstock costs
and most other costs are denominated in euro and British pounds. In our U.S. petrochemical and chemical
intermediates businesses, product prices, raw material costs and most other costs are primarily denominated
in U.S. dollars. We generally do not enter into foreign currency exchange instruments to hedge our foreign
currency exposure, although we have done so in the past and we may do so in the future. We also believe that
we benefit from natural hedging to the extent that we have been able to match the currencies of our cash
flows and long-term indebtedness.

Our reporting currency is the euro, and our results of operations will be impacted by the relative
strength of the euro against other currencies, including the U.S. dollar and the British pound. In the first
half of 2020, the value of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar decreased in the context of the COVID 19
outbreak before increasing again during the second half of 2020 and throughout the first half of 2021, before
decreasing again during the second half of 2021 and most of 2022, until a slight recovery at the end of the
year with periods of volatility in 2023 (although remaining below the peak 2022 levels and above 2021 levels).

_Environmental Considerations_

Our results of operations are affected by environmental laws and regulations, including those
relating to GHG and other air emissions, and environmental risks and goals generally. We have invested,
and will continue to invest, a significant amount of financial and technical resources in order to achieve and
maintain compliance with environmental requirements. From time to time, we also incur remediation and
decommissioning costs at our current and former production facilities, as well as at other locations.
Environmental considerations can also impact the markets in which we operate, including our position with
respect to our competitors.

_COVID-19_

Our results of operations were, and may in the future be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and
subsequent variants of COVID-19. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the
COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic and there is elevated concern globally about the impact that the
COVID-19 crisis will have on the global economy. While the Group produces a variety of chemicals which
are used in the production of medical equipment, including face masks, ventilators, gloves, eye visors and antibacterial hand gel, and are also widely used in food packaging with respect to which demand has increased
due to COVID-19, demand for durables such as for use in the automotive and construction industry declined
in 2020 before recovering in 2021.

For example, sales volumes were approximately 2% lower in the year ended December 31, 2020 as
compared to the same period in 2019 as the COVID-19 virus pandemic impacted demand across all
regions, as numerous countries entered lockdowns throughout 2020. The biggest decrease was in the
Chemical Intermediates segment as volumes were adversely impacted by lower market demand. The Group’s
results were also adversely impacted by the sharp fall in raw material costs which led to significant inventory
holding losses during 2020. Nevertheless, demand for packaging, medical, food and cleaning applications
was strong, largely offsetting the automotive and construction downturn as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic.

In early March 2020, the Group developed contingency plans for the COVID-19 pandemic, with
the primary objectives of maintaining the safety of personnel and the reliable operation of the Group’s


-----

plants. This resulted in a number of changes to standard working practices and shift patterns to reduce
personnel on site to those defined as operationally critical in order to adhere to social distancing rules in line
with local government advice.

Any safety critical activity was formally risk assessed to take cognizance of additional controls
necessary to protect core personnel from COVID-19, hence safeguarding safety critical work at all times.
The Group implemented a number of measures to conserve cash during 2020, including:

     - implementing policies to control all discretionary fixed costs and halting all non-essential
recruitment;

     - reviewing all capital projects in each of the businesses and taking decisions to defer or reduce
discretionary expenditure where it was safe to do so, and delaying planned site maintenance
turnarounds where possible; and

     - applying for corporate tax refunds and deferrals where available.

Throughout the pandemic all of the Group’s plants continued to operate fully and supply chains
operated without significant disruption. Protecting employees and ensuring that they remained healthy was
the first priority of the Group. All plants had sufficient resources and implemented measures to ensure
that this remained the case throughout the pandemic.

**Results of Operations**

The consolidated financial information of INEOS is prepared in accordance with IFRS. The
income statement data for the years ended December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020
and the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022 represent the consolidated
results of the Group.

**_Description of Key Line Items_**

Set forth below is a brief description of the composition of the key line items of our consolidated
income statement accounts:

    - Revenue. Group revenue represents the invoiced value of products sold or services provided to
third parties net of sales discounts and value-added taxes. It also excludes our share of joint venture
revenue. The pricing for products sold is determined by market prices (market contracts and
arrangements) or is linked by a formula to published raw material prices plus an agreed additional
amount (formula contracts). Services provided to third parties include administrative and
operational services provided to other chemical companies with units on our sites, and services
under tolling arrangements. Under tolling arrangements, customers pay for or provide raw
materials to be converted into a certain specified product, for which we charge a toll fee.

     - Cost of sales and cost of sales before exceptional items. Cost of sales and cost of sales before
exceptional items include fixed and variable production costs. Such production costs typically
include the costs of raw materials, packaging, utilities, direct wages and salaries, repairs and
maintenance, waste disposal and effluent treatment, consumables, attributable depreciation
charges and directly attributable overheads, including wages and salaries, depreciation charges
and overheads that are attributable to production. Fixed costs included in the cost of sales are rent,
depreciation, repairs and maintenance, while variable costs include raw materials, packaging,
consumables and wages and salaries.

    - Exceptional impairment charge. Exceptional impairment charge is an expense which, because of
its size or nature, is disclosed to give a proper understanding of the underlying results for the
period. These expenses are mainly related to the impairment of property, plant and equipment.
For the periods under review, this relates to the termination of work at a site in Belgium.

     - Distribution costs. Distribution costs typically include the costs of warehousing, carriage and
freight, together with sales and distribution wages and salaries and depreciation on property, plant
and equipment used for sales and distribution.

     - Administrative expenses and administrative expenses before exceptional items. Administrative
expenses and administrative expenses before exceptional items typically include indirect wages and
salaries and indirect overheads. Indirect overheads would include such items as insurance costs,
legal and professional fees and office supplies. Administrative expenses before exceptional items


-----

also include the depreciation of property, plant and equipment not directly attributable to
production or sales and distribution.

    - Exceptional administrative gains/(expenses). Exceptional administrative gains/(expenses) are
those gains/(expenses) which, because of their size or nature, are disclosed to give a proper
understanding of the underlying results for the period. These gains/(expenses) are mainly related
to closure and demolition costs, business restructuring and the provision for severance payments.

     - Share of profit/(loss) of associates and joint ventures using the equity accounting method. Share
of profit/(loss) of associates and joint ventures using the equity accounting method relates to
the results from the investment in associated undertakings and joint ventures. For the periods
under review, this includes the Group’s share in the Refining Business JV through its shares in
INEOS Investments. These shares were sold to a related party in December 2022. In 2023, this also
includes the Group’s share of losses from the SECCO joint venture with Sinopec which we
acquired, through Unrestricted Subsidiaries, in December 2022.

     - Profit/(loss) on disposal of investments. Profit/(loss) on disposal of investments relates to the
profit/(loss) from the disposal of associates and joint ventures.

    - Finance income and Total finance income. Finance income and Total finance income include
interest receivable on funds invested, expected return on defined benefit pension plan assets, net
fair value gain on derivatives and net foreign exchange gains.

     - Finance costs and finance costs before exceptional items. Finance costs and finance costs before
exceptional items include interest payable, finance charges on finance leases, unwinding of the
discount on provisions, net fair value losses derivatives and foreign exchange losses.

     - Exceptional finance costs. Exceptional finance costs are those costs which, because of their size
or nature, are disclosed to give a proper understanding of the underlying results for the period.
These costs are mainly related to call premia and the write-off of unamortized debt issue costs
following modification or redemption of debt.

**_Consolidated Results_**

_Revenue._ Revenue decreased by €5,388.1 million, or 32.2%, to €11,323.1 million in the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2023 as compared to €16,711.2 million for the same period in 2022. The decrease


-----

in revenues was driven primarily by lower volumes and a decrease in selling prices. Overall sales volumes for
the Group were approximately 12% lower in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 as compared
to the same period in 2022. The decrease in selling prices followed the decrease in crude oil prices, which
decreased to an average of $82/bbl for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 as compared to
$105/bbl in the same period in 2022.

_Cost of sales._ Cost of sales decreased by €4,139.8 million, or 28.7%, to €10,261.7 million in the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 as compared to €14,401.5 million for the same period in
2022. The decrease in cost of sales was largely due to lower volumes and the decrease in crude oil prices,
which has meant lower feedstock prices across the Group in the nine-month period ended September 30,
2023, as compared to the same period in 2022.

_Gross profit._ Gross profit decreased by €1,248.3 million, or 54.0%, to €1,061.4 million in the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, as compared to €2,309.7 million for the same period in 2022.
During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 high energy costs, particularly in Europe, and
continued high inflation rates have led to reduced demand levels and erosion of margins from the previous
strong performance in the same period in 2022. The decrease in profitability was driven by lower margins,
inventory holding losses and a decrease in volumes which were approximately 12% lower in the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022. The profitability of the O&P
North America business decreased due to lower volumes and a decrease in margins. Ethylene markets
were weaker in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022
with lower demand, improved industry supply availability and reduced export opportunities. Polymer markets
were softer with erosion of margins for most products during 2023, although pipe markets remained solid.
O&P North America sales volumes in 2023 were adversely impacted by an incident on a pipeline at the O&P
North America Chocolate Bayou, Texas facility, which resulted in reduced operating rates and the adverse
impact of a tornado event at the Battleground, Texas site. The O&P Europe business also experienced a
decrease in volumes which was partially offset by higher margins in the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2023. The market for olefins in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 was
generally weaker than the same period in 2022, with most industry crackers being trimmed across Europe.
Propylene markets were long with weak demand across most derivatives in 2023 due to high energy costs
which adversely impacted the economics of all derivatives. European polymer markets were weaker with
reduced demand and increased levels of imports in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 as
compared to the same period in 2022. The increase in margins was driven by the Trading and Shipping
business which experienced higher margins in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 as compared
to the same period in 2022. The O&P segments were also adversely impacted by inventory holding losses
of approximately €82 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, as compared to inventory
holding gains of €56 million in the same period in 2022. Chemical Intermediates experienced a decline in
profitability in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022 as
all businesses experienced a decrease in volumes in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 as
compared to the same period in 2022 with volumes in the Oxide business being adversely impacted by an
incident on a supplier pipeline at the Plaquemine, Louisiana site where a force majeure was declared.

_Distribution costs._ Distribution costs increased by €10.9 million, or 7.1%, to €164.2 million in the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 as compared to €153.3 million for the same period in 2022.
The increase in distribution costs reflected inflationary pressures on freight costs which was only partially
offset by lower sales volumes in the period.

_Administrative expenses._ Administrative expenses increased by €68.2 million, or 22.2%, to
€375.7 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 as compared to €307.5 million for the
same period in 2022, mainly as a result of inflationary cost pressures and a one-off impairment of intangible
fixed assets within the O&P North America business of €26.1 million. In addition the Group had higher
other operating expenses in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the same
period in 2022.

_Operating profit._ Operating profit decreased by €1,327.4 million, or 71.8%, to €521.5 million in
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 as compared to €1,848.9 million for the same period in
2022.

_Share of profit/(loss) of associates and joint ventures using the equity accounting method._ Share of
(loss)/profit of associates and joint ventures was a loss of €115.4 million in the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2023 as compared to a profit of €134.2 million for the same period in 2022. The share of loss
from associates and joint ventures in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 primarily reflected


-----

the Group’s share of losses from the SECCO joint venture with Sinopec which was acquired in
December 2022. The share of profit from associates and joint ventures in the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2022 primarily reflected the Group’s share of the results of the Refining joint venture with
PetroChina. On December 23, 2022 the Group disposed of its non-voting ordinary shares in INEOS
Investments to INEOS Limited, a related party, with an effective date of November 30, 2022, so after this
date the Group no longer had any economic interest in the Refining joint venture.

_Loss on disposal of investments._ There was a loss on disposal of investments of €0.4 million in the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2023.

_Loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment._ There was a loss on disposal of property, plant
and equipment of €0.4 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023.

_Profit before net finance costs._ Profit before net finance costs decreased by €1,577.8 million, or
79.6%, to €405.3 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 as compared to €1,983.1 million
for the same period in 2022.

_Finance income._ Finance income increased by €120.5 million, or 215.2%, to €176.5 million in the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 as compared to €56.0 million for the same period in 2022.
The income in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 primarily related to interest income from
loans to related parties, including INEOS Upstream and INEOS Industries, together with higher interest
rates on cash balances held by the Group.

_Finance costs before exceptional items._ Finance costs before exceptional items increased by
€136.9 million, or 35.9%, to €518.6 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 as compared
to €381.7 million for the same period in 2022. The increase in finance costs for the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2023 reflected the higher level of indebtedness and higher interest costs on the Group’s
variable rate debt and refinanced fixed rate debt as a result of higher interest rates in the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022. In addition, there was a lower
net fair value gain on derivatives of €43.2 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, as
compared to a gain of €159.3 million for the same period in 2022. These increases were partly offset by lower
foreign exchange losses of €13.9 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 as compared
to €309.1 million in the same period in 2022.

_Exceptional finance costs._ Exceptional finance costs of €8.5 million were charged in the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2023 following an assessment of the Rain Facilities syndication as the
amendment was deemed to be a substantial modification which resulted in the write-off of unamortized
issue costs.

_Profit before tax._ Profit before tax decreased by €1,602.7 million, or 96.7%, to €54.7 million in
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, as compared to a profit of €1,657.4 million for the same
period in 2022.

_Tax charge._ Tax charge decreased by €215.4 million, or 80.8%, to €51.3 million in the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2023, as compared to €266.7 million for the same period in 2022 primarily due
to the decreased profitability of the Group. After adjusting for the loss from the share of associates and
joint ventures, the effective tax rate of approximately 30% in the nine-month period ended September 30,
2023 reflects the anticipated tax rate for the Group for the full year. After adjusting for the profit from the
share of associates and joint ventures, the effective tax rate of approximately 18% in the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2022 reflected the anticipated tax rate for the Group for the full year. The higher
anticipated effective tax rate for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same
period in 2022 reflected the decreased level of profitability of the Group in countries with lower corporate
tax rates.

_Profit for the period._ Profit for the period decreased by €1,387.3 million, or 99.8%, to €3.4 million
in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, as compared to €1,390.7 million for the same period
in 2022.

**_O&P North America_**

_Revenue._ Revenue in the O&P North America segment decreased by €1,459.8 million, or 32.2%,
to €3,069.6 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, as compared to €4,529.4 million
for the same period in 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by lower prices and lower sales volumes in the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022. The weighted
average sales price for the whole business was approximately 30% lower in the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022 as olefins and polymers experienced a decrease
in price. Overall sales volumes decreased by approximately 3% in the nine-month period ended September 30,
2023 as compared to the same period in 2022 as the business experienced lower olefin, polypropylene,
polyethylene and pipe volumes. Volumes were adversely impacted in the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2023 following a pipeline incident at the Chocolate Bayou, Texas facility which resulted in
lower production of ethylene and polyethylene, a tornado at the Battleground facility in Texas which impacted
polyethylene sales, an unplanned outage at the Styrolution Bayport plant and a planned outage at the
Oligomers LAO plant at Chocolate Bayou which adversely impacted olefins sales.

_EBITDA before exceptionals._ EBITDA before exceptionals in the O&P North America segment
decreased by €457.8 million, or 44.5%, to €570.9 million in the nine-month period ended September 30,
2023 as compared to €1,028.7 million in the same period in 2022. The decrease in profitability in the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022 was largely due to
lower margins and sales volumes. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 the business
experienced lower olefin, polyethylene and polypropylene margins which was partially offset by higher
pipe margins. Overall sales volumes decreased by approximately 3% in the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022 for the reasons mentioned above. Inventory
holding losses were approximately €7 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, as
compared to losses of approximately €16 million in the same period in 2022.

**_O&P Europe_**

_Revenue._ Revenue in the O&P Europe segment decreased by €2,703.2 million, or 36.2%, to
€4,756.5 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 as compared to €7,459.7 million for
the same period in 2022. The decrease in revenues was driven primarily by lower selling prices and lower sales
volumes in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022. The
decrease in selling prices was driven by weakened demand and the general price environment, which was lower
in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022, as crude oil
prices fell to an average of $82/bbl for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 as compared to an
average of $105/bbl for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022. Overall sales volumes decreased
by approximately 17% in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same period
in 2022 as ethylene suffered from weakened demand which caused destocking with most industry crackers
being trimmed across Europe, while propylene experienced a very weak market as high energy costs impacted
the economics for all derivatives. The trading and shipping business experienced higher sales volumes in
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to
higher ethane sales.


-----

_EBITDA before exceptionals._ EBITDA before exceptionals in the O&P Europe segment decreased
by €317.4 million, or 54.6%, to €264.3 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, as
compared to €581.7 million in the same period in 2022. The results for the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2023 decreased compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to decreased volumes
and inventory holding losses. Overall sales volumes were approximately 17% lower in the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022 due to reduced demand and high
energy costs adversely impacting the economics of all derivatives. Inventory holding losses were approximately
€75 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 as compared to gains of approximately
€72 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022. Partially offsetting the decrease was an
increase in margins which was driven by the Trading and Shipping business which experienced higher margins
in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022.

**_Chemical Intermediates_**

_Revenue._ Revenue in the Chemical Intermediates segment decreased by €2,697.6 million, or
34.1%, to €5,222.6 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 as compared to
€7,920.2 million for the same period in 2022. The Oxide business revenues decreased in the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022 driven by lower volumes and lower
prices. Sales volumes were approximately 17% lower in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023
as compared to the same period in 2022 as the business experienced what we believe are bottom of cycle
market conditions. The high energy costs and higher inflation have led to consumer uncertainty and weaker
market conditions in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 with several customers closing units
due to lack of demand. Volumes were also adversely impacted by an incident on a supplier pipeline at the
Plaquemine, Louisiana site in the third quarter of 2023. Lower demand and competition from cheaper
imports has put product pricing under considerable pressure, especially for commodity products. This has
led to a significant decrease in prices in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the
same period in 2022, although prices for specialty products have seen less price pressure due to the limited
impact from cheaper imports. The Oligomers business revenues were lower in the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022, primarily as a result of lower prices and to a
lesser extent volumes. Regional prices in 2023 moved in line with the underlying raw material prices of ethylene
and naphtha. Regional feedstock prices were lower in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 as
compared to the same period in 2022 with lower European and US ethylene prices impacting LAO and PAO
prices, while lower naphtha prices impacted PIB and SO pricing. Sales volumes were approximately 3%
lower in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022, as a result
of lower LAO, PAO, and SO sales volumes. The decrease in LAO sales volumes was seen in the European
and Asian markets, partially offset by higher North American volumes. PAO sales volumes were lower in
North America and Asia, partially offset by higher European sales volumes while SO sales volumes were
lower across all three regions. Nitriles revenues decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30,
2023 as compared to the same period in 2022, driven by lower prices and lower sales volumes. Weakened
demand and lower US propylene prices also led to the average acrylonitrile sales price decreasing by
approximately 33% in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same period in
2022. The business also experienced lower acrylonitrile sales volumes which decreased by approximately 14%
in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022 due to lower
demand. The Phenol business revenues decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 as
compared to the same period in 2022, driven by lower prices and lower volumes. Selling prices moved in line
with the underlying raw material prices with acetone and phenol prices moving lower in both the European
and the North American markets due to significant decreases in propylene and benzene feedstock prices.
Sales volumes were approximately 22% lower in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 as compared
to the same period in 2022 as weakened market demand particularly in Europe led to lower phenol and
acetone sales volumes, although this was partially offset by the acquisition of Mitsui Phenols Singapore Ltd
on March 31, 2023, which added additional sales volumes in the nine-month period ended September 30,
2023.

_EBITDA before exceptionals._ EBITDA before exceptionals in the Chemical Intermediates
segment decreased by €439.7 million, or 52.5%, to €398.6 million in the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2023 as compared to €838.3 million for the same period in 2022. The Oxide business results
in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 were lower compared to the same period in 2022 due to
lower volumes and lower margins. Higher energy costs have led to high inflation rates which have resulted
in weak market conditions in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same
period in 2022. As a result, consumer uncertainty has adversely impacted volumes, which decreased by
approximately 17% in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same period in


-----

2022. The Oxide business is experiencing bottom of cycle conditions as cheaper European imports have
caused significant margin pressure especially on commodity products in the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022. The business results have also been adversely
impacted in the third quarter of 2023 by an incident on a supplier pipeline at the Plaquemine, Louisiana site
where a force majeure was declared. The Oligomers business profitability decreased in the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2023 as compared with the same period in 2022. The business experienced a
decrease in sales volumes of approximately 3% in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 as
compared to the same period in 2022, as a result of lower LAO, PAO and SO sales volumes, partially offset
by higher PIB sales volumes. The business experienced higher PAO and SO margins, but lower LAO and
PIB margins in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 as compared with the same period in 2022.
LAO margins were lower in North America and Europe, partially offset by higher margins in Asia. Lower
production costs in 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022 led to an increase in PAO margins which
were higher in North America and Europe, partially offset by lower margins in Asia. SO margins were
only higher in Europe, while PIB margins decreased in both North America and Asia in the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2023 as compared with the same period in 2022. The Nitriles business experienced
a decrease in profitability in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same
period in 2022, driven by lower margins and decreased sales volumes. Acrylonitrile margins and volumes
decreased as a result of weakened demand and poor Asian export margins, although the third quarter of 2023
saw firm demand in North America. The Phenol business profitability decreased in the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to lower volumes and
margins and higher fixed costs. Sales volumes were approximately 22% lower in the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022 as weakened market demand in Europe
led to lower phenol and acetone sales volumes. The acquisition of Mitsui Phenols Singapore Ltd on March 31,
2023 added additional sales volumes as well as additional fixed costs in the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022.

**_Year Ended December 31, 2022, Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2021_**

**_Consolidated Results_**

_Revenue._ Revenue increased by €2,100.3 million, or 11.2%, to €20,927.0 million in the year ended
December 31, 2022 as compared to €18,826.7 million for the same period in 2021. The increase in revenues
was driven by higher selling prices and the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro, partly offset by
lower sales volumes. Selling prices followed the increase in crude oil prices, which increased to an average
of $101 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to $71 per barrel in the same period
in 2021. In addition, the appreciation of the U.S. dollar by approximately 11% against the euro in the year
ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021, has increased the reported euro
revenues. Overall sales volumes for the Group were approximately 4% lower in the year ended December 31,
2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 with all businesses experiencing a decrease in sales volumes
apart from the O&P Europe and Oligomers businesses.

_Cost of sales before exceptional items._ Cost of sales before exceptional items increased by
€2,955.5 million, or 19.2%, to €18,313.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to
€15,357.7 million for the same period in 2021. The increase in cost of sales was largely due to the increase in
crude oil prices, resulting in higher feedstock prices across the Group in the year ended December 31,
2022, as compared to the same period in 2021. Energy costs were also notably higher, especially in Europe,
in the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021.

_Gross profit._ Gross profit decreased by €855.2 million, or 24.7%, to €2,613.8 million in the year
ended December 31, 2022 as compared to €3,469.0 million for the same period in 2021. The decrease in
profitability was driven by inventory holdings losses, lower margins and lower volumes. Overall sales volumes
for the Group were approximately 4% lower in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the
same period in 2021 with all businesses experiencing a decrease in sales volumes apart from the O&P Europe
and Oligomers businesses. Inventory holding losses within the O&P segments were approximately
€93 million in year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to inventory holding gains of €279 million in
the same period in 2021. In O&P North America olefins, polyethylene and polypropylene all experienced a
decrease in margins following higher energy and feedstock costs along with lengthening domestic supplies,
although this was partially offset by higher pipe margins. In addition, export opportunities were reduced
during the period due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar, along with improved industry supply. O&P
Europe saw an increase in margins in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period in
2021. This was offset, however, by higher fixed costs and the adverse impact of a scheduled maintenance
turnaround of the Rafnes cracker. The increase in fixed costs was a result of the start of the ATEX pipeline
in the Trading and Shipping business, along with the entry into service of two new VLEC vessels and their
associated costs. The scheduled maintenance turnaround of the Rafnes cracker resulted in a change in product
mix which resulted in lower margin products from other sites replacing the lost volumes at the Rafnes site.
Chemical Intermediates experienced a decrease in profitability in the year ended December 31, 2022 as
compared to the same period in 2021, following decreases in profitability in the Nitriles and Phenol
business driven primarily by lower sales volumes. This was partially offset by an increase in profitability in
the Oligomers business following higher margins and increased sales volumes during 2022 as compared to
2021. Partly offsetting the decrease in Group profitability was the appreciation of the U.S. dollar by
approximately 11% against the euro in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period
in 2021, which increased the reported euro results.

_Distribution costs._ Distribution costs decreased by €6.0 million, or 2.8%, to €209.1 million in the
year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to €215.1 million for the same period in 2021. The decrease in
distribution costs reflects lower sales volumes and improved logistical contracts which have reduced freight
costs in certain parts of Europe.

_Administrative expenses before exceptional items._ Administrative expenses before exceptional
items increased by €0.8 million, or 0.2%, to €399.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared
to €398.4 million for the same period in 2021, mainly as a result of higher research and development costs
in the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021.

_Exceptional administrative (expenses)/gains._ Exceptional administrative expenses of €4.2 million
were charged for the year ended December 31, 2022, which related to a provision for early retirement costs
as part of a restructuring of the Köln site within the O&P Europe business. In December 2019 the Group took
the decision to close the Nitriles facility at Seal Sands, United Kingdom. Poor operating performance and
uneconomic capital expenditure requirements to meet safety and environmental obligations led to the decision.
During the year ended December 31, 2021 an exceptional administrative gain of €8.9 million was credited


-----

to the income statement following the final true up of the original closure cost provision made in
December 2019 as a result of lower than expected demolition costs.

_Operating profit._ Operating profit decreased by €863.1 million, or 30.1%, to €2,001.3 million in
the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to €2,864.4 million for the same period in 2021.

_Share of profit/(loss) of associates and joint ventures using the equity accounting method._ Share of
profit/(loss) of associates and joint ventures using the equity accounting method was a profit of
€147.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to a loss of €42.5 million for the same
period in 2021. The share of profit of associates and joint ventures using the equity accounting method
primarily reflected the Group’s share of the results of the Refining joint venture with PetroChina as margins
in the European refining market have strengthened in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to
the same period in 2021.

_Profit on disposal of investments._ Profit on disposal of investments was €270.6 million in the year
ended December 31, 2022. On December 23, 2022 the Group disposed of its non-voting ordinary shares in
INEOS Investments (Jersey) Limited to INEOS Limited, a related party with an effective date of
November 30, 2022 which resulted in a profit on disposal of €270.6 million. From November 30, 2022 the
Group no longer had any economic interest in the Refining joint venture.

_(Loss)/profit on disposal of fixed assets._ There was a loss on disposal of fixed assets of €0.6 million
in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to a profit of €0.3 million for the same period in 2021.

_Profit before net finance costs._ Profit before net finance costs decreased by €403.7 million, or
14.3%, to €2,418.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to €2,822.2 million for the
same period in 2021.

_Total finance income._ Total finance income increased by €31.7 million, or 12.8%, to €279.9 million
in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to €248.2 million for the same period in 2021. The
increase in income in the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily related to net fair value gain on derivatives
of €186.2 million as compared to €76.1 million for the same period in 2021 along with interest income
from loans to related parties, including INEOS Upstream, and interest received on increased cash balances
held by the Group.

_Finance costs before exceptional items._ Finance costs before exceptional items decreased by
€109.2 million, or 20.8%, to €415.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to
€525.0 million for the same period in 2021. The decrease in finance costs in the year ended December 31,
2022 reflected a decrease in net foreign exchange, partially offset by an increase in interest payable on
borrowings. The decrease in net foreign exchange losses was primarily associated with short-term intragroup funding, which experienced net foreign exchange losses of €62.2 million in the year ended December 31,
2022 as compared to net foreign exchange losses of €234.4 million in the same period in 2021. Interest
payable on variable rate borrowings increased in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared the same
period in 2021 due to an increase in base rates during 2022, along with a higher level of borrowings in 2022 as
compared to 2021.

_Exceptional finance costs._ Exceptional finance costs of €3.5 million were charged for the year
ended December 31, 2021 following the write-off of deferred issue costs as a result of the early redemption
of the Senior Notes due 2024 in November 2021.

_Profit before tax._ Profit before tax decreased by €259.3 million, or 10.2%, to €2,282.6 million in
the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to €2,541.9 million for the same period in 2021.

_Tax charge._ Tax charge decreased by €167.6 million, or 37.3%, to €282.0 million in the year ended
December 31, 2022, as compared to €449.6 million for the same period in 2021 primarily due to the decreased
profitability of the Group. After adjusting for the profit/(loss) from the share of associates and joint
ventures, the effective tax rate for the Group for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 15%, as compared
to 17% in 2021. The effective tax rate for the Group was lower than the standard rate in Luxembourg of
24.94% as profits were made in regions with lower rates which more than offset profits made in regions
with higher rates than the standard rate.

_Profit for the year._ Profit for the year decreased by €91.7 million, or 4.4% to €2,000.6 million in
the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to €2,092.3 million for the same period in 2021.

**_O&P North America_**

_Revenue._ Revenue in the O&P North America segment increased by €196.6 million, or 3.6%, to
€5,723.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to €5,527.3 million for the same period
in 2021. The increase was primarily driven by the appreciation of the U.S. dollar by approximately 11%
against the euro in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 as the
underlying US dollar revenues have decreased. Sales volumes decreased by approximately 1% in the year
ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021 driven by lower olefin sales which were
only partially offset by higher polyethylene volumes from the Gemini plant as unplanned downtime in
2021 adversely impacted volumes in 2021. Pipe volumes also increased in the year ended December 31, 2022
as compared to the same period in 2021 due to additional sales volumes from the Charter Plastics business
which was acquired on December 31, 2021. The weighted average sales price for the whole business was lower
in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 as a result of lower olefin
and polymer prices, partially offset by higher pipe prices.

_EBITDA before exceptionals._ EBITDA before exceptionals in the O&P North America segment
decreased by €372.8 million, or 23.6%, to €1,204.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared
to €1,577.2 million in the same period in 2021. The decrease in profitability in the year ended December 31,
2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 was largely due to lower margins and the adverse impact of
inventory holding losses. Olefins, polyethylene and polypropylene all experienced a decrease in margins
following higher energy and feedstock costs along with lengthening domestic supplies, although this was
partially offset by higher pipe margins. In addition, export opportunities were reduced during the period
due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar, along with improved industry supply. Inventory holding losses were
approximately €80 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to inventory holding gains
of approximately €75 million in the same period in 2021. The decrease in profitability was partly offset by the
appreciation of the U.S. dollar by approximately 11% against the euro in the year ended December 31,
2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 which has increased the reported euro results.

**_O&P Europe_**

_Revenue._ Revenue in the O&P Europe segment increased by €1,651.7 million, or 21.9%, to
€9,177.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to €7,526.0 million for the same period
in 2021. The increase in revenues was driven primarily by higher selling prices and increased sales volumes in
the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021. The increase in selling prices
was driven by the general price environment, which was higher in the year ended December 31, 2022 as


-----

compared to the same period in 2021, as crude oil prices rose to an average of $ 101 per barrel for the year
ended December 31, 2022 as compared to $71 per barrel in the same period in 2021. As a result, all prices
increased in the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021. Total sales
volumes were approximately 1% higher in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same
period in 2021. The increase in sales volumes was driven by the Trading and Shipping business which
experienced higher sales volumes in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period in
2021, primarily due to higher ethane and butane sales. Olefin sales volumes were slightly lower in the year
ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 due to weakening markets with lower
demand caused by inflation as a result of the high energy prices. Polymer sales volumes decreased in the year
ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 due to reduced demand and an increased
level of imports as compared to the same period in 2021.

_EBITDA before exceptionals._ EBITDA before exceptionals in the O&P Europe segment decreased
by €292.6 million, or 30.9%, to €655.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to
€948.2 million in the same period in 2021. The results for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased
compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to inventory holding losses, higher fixed costs and the
impact on product mix, which was only partially offset by an increase in margins. Inventory holding losses
were approximately €13 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to gains of approximately
€204 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. Fixed costs rose in the year ended December 31, 2022 as
compared to the same period in 2021, mainly as a result of the start of the ATEX pipeline in the Trading
and Shipping business, along with the entry into service of two new VLEC ships and their associated costs.
The product mix effect mainly arose as a result of the scheduled turnaround maintenance of the Rafnes
cracker during the year ended December 31, 2022. While the reduction in volumes due to the turnaround
was largely offset by higher volumes at other sites, these offsetting volumes were in lower margin products
than those produced at the Rafnes site.

**_Chemical Intermediates_**

_Revenue._ Revenue in the Chemical Intermediates segment increased by €1,306.7 million, or
15.4%, to €9,802.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to €8,496.2 million for the
same period in 2021. The Oxide business revenues increased in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared
to the same period in 2021 driven by higher prices. The increase in pricing was driven by rising raw
material and natural gas prices which were mainly passed on to customers through the formula based
pricing of most products. Sales volumes in the year ended December 31, 2022 were in line with 2021. Most
of 2022 experienced strong European demand as competitor logistical supply issues limited European imports,
which had a favorable impact on European supply demand balance; however higher European gas prices
and geopolitical pressures started to adversely impact demand in the latter part of 2022. The Oligomers
business revenues were higher in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021,
as a result of higher prices and increased sales volumes. Regional prices in the year ended December 31,
2022 moved in line with the underlying raw material prices of ethylene and naphtha. Regional feedstock prices
were higher in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 with higher
European and U.S. ethylene prices impacting PAO and LAO prices, while increased naphtha prices impacted
PIB and SO pricing. Sales volumes were approximately 11% higher in the year ended December 31, 2022
as compared to the same period in 2021 as higher LAO sales volumes were only partially offset by lower PAO,
PIB and SO sales volumes. The increase in LAO sales volumes was seen across all regions and included
good co-monomer demand with the business benefitting from additional production volumes from the new
LAO facility in Chocolate Bayou, United States. Nitriles revenues increased in the year ended December 31,
2022 as compared to the same period in 2021, driven by higher prices partly offset by lower volumes. The
average acrylonitrile sales price increased by over 12% in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared
to the same period in 2021, driven by higher ammonia pricing as a result of higher natural gas prices.
Acrylonitrile sales volumes decreased in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period
in 2021 due to lower demand as a result of high European and North American cost positions which
adversely impacted demand. The Phenol business revenues increased in the year ended December 31, 2022
as compared to the same period in 2021, driven primarily by higher prices, partly offset by lower sales volumes.
Selling prices moved in line with the underlying raw material prices with acetone and phenol prices moving
significantly higher due to increases in European propylene and global benzene feedstock prices. Sales volumes
were lower in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 as a result of
lower phenol and acetone sales as weaker market demand led to lower volumes, predominately in the
European market.

_EBITDA before exceptionals._ EBITDA before exceptionals in the Chemical Intermediates
segment decreased by €110.2 million, or 10.1%, to €980.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 as


-----

compared to €1,090.8 million for the same period in 2021. The Oxide business results in the year ended
December 31, 2022 were in line with the same period in 2021. Margins at the start of 2022 were maintained
at the levels experienced in 2021 as increases in underlying raw material costs were successfully passed on
through higher rates than the standard market pricing formulas in the first half of 2022 before higher energy
costs and geopolitical pressures started to put some pressure on margins in the second half of 2022. Sales
volumes in the year ended December 31, 2022 were in line with the same period in 2021, driven by strong
European demand as competitor logistical supply issues limited European imports, which had a favorable
impact on European market balances in the first half of 2022 before high European gas prices and
geopolitical pressures started to adversely impact demand in the latter part of 2022. The Oligomers business
profitability increased in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared with the same period in 2021,
primarily due to higher margins and increased sales volumes. Margins were higher across all product lines
in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared with the same period in 2021 due to higher overall
realizations being increased above higher raw material and energy costs. The business also benefitted from
higher LAO sales volumes following good co-monomer demand and the additional production volumes from
the new LAO facility in Chocolate Bayou, United States. The Nitriles business experienced a decrease in
profitability in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021, driven by tower
volumes and to a lesser extent lower margins. Acrylonitrile sales volumes decreased in the year ended
December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 due to lower demand as a result of high European
and North American cost positions. Acrylonitrile margins were lower in the year ended December 31,
2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 as higher feedstock costs squeezed margins. The Phenol business
profitability decreased in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021,
largely due to a decrease in volumes. Volumes were lower due to reduced market demand for phenol and
acetone, predominantly in the European market.

**_Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2020_**

**_Consolidated Results_**

_Revenue._ Revenue increased by €7,523.0 million, or 66.6%, to €18,826.7 million for the year
ended December 31, 2021 as compared to €11,303.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The
increase in revenues was driven primarily by higher prices and increased sales volumes. The increase in selling
prices followed the significant rise in crude oil prices, which increased to an average of $71 per barrel for
the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $42 per barrel in the same period in 2020. The largest price
increases were in the O&P businesses which experienced higher prices across all product lines reflecting
healthy demand and tight markets as economies began to recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall
sales volumes for the Group were approximately 9% higher in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared
to the year ended December 31, 2020 with the O&P and Phenol businesses experiencing the biggest
increase from resurgent economies, after 2020 volumes were adversely impacted by the effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic.

_Cost of sales before exceptional items._ Cost of sales before exceptional items increased by
€5,436.2 million, or 54.8%, to €15,357.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to
€9,921.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in cost of sales was largely due to the
increase in crude oil prices in 2021, resulting in higher feedstock prices across the Group as well as increased
volumes in the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020.

_Exceptional impairment charge._ Exceptional impairment charges of €118.5 million were charged
for the year ended December 31, 2020 in relation to certain plant and equipment following the Group’s
decision to terminate work on a propane dehydrogenation unit and associated infrastructure at its site in
Antwerp, Belgium.

_Gross profit._ Gross profit increased by €2,205.3 million, or 174.5%, to €3,469.0 million for the
year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to €1,263.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The
increase in profitability was driven by higher margins, increased sales volumes and inventory holding
gains. Sales volumes were approximately 9% higher in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to
the same period in 2020 as the Group experienced higher volumes driven by tighter markets from a
combination of stronger demand from resurgent economies and industry supply constraints. This also led
to an increase in margins across all businesses within the Group due to the favorable market conditions during
the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020. O&P North America
experienced higher margins across all product lines in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to
the same period in 2020, particularly polyethylene and polypropylene, due to a combination of strong
demand from a resurgent U.S. economy and industry supply constraints, while olefin margins benefitted from


-----

a tighter market. Overall margins in O&P Europe increased during the year ended December 31, 2021 as
compared to the same period in 2020 following higher olefin margins due to a stronger market, with demand
for butadiene and benzene being particularly strong as compared to the unfavorable market conditions in
2020. The polymers business experienced an increase in margins due to logistical challenges in the market
which reduced the level of European imports, coupled with strong U.S. and European demand in both the
durables and consumables markets. Inventory holding gains within the O&P segments were approximately
€279 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to inventory holding losses of €43 million in
the same period in 2020, reflecting the increased raw material costs during 2021. Chemical Intermediates
experienced an increase in profitability across all businesses in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared
to the same period in 2020 with the Oxide business experiencing record margins. This was driven by
commodity products within the Oxide business, with both glycol margins and volumes increasing due to
lower European imports, competitor outages and strong European and Asian demand. Partially offsetting
the increase in profitability across the Group was the depreciation of the U.S. dollar by approximately 5%
against the euro in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 which
decreased the reported euro results.

_Distribution costs._ Distribution costs increased by €7.7 million, or 3.7%, to €215.1 million for the
year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to €207.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The
increase in distribution costs in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020
reflected the higher sales volumes across the Group in 2021, partially offset by the depreciation of the
U.S. dollar by approximately 5% against the euro in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the
same period in 2020 which decreased the reported euro costs.

_Administrative expenses before exceptional items._ Administrative expenses before exceptional
items increased by €10.9 million, or 2.8%, to €398.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as
compared to €387.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in administrative expenses
was primarily due to higher employee performance bonus accruals (including long term incentive plans)
following a stronger than budgeted performance across all businesses within the Group in the year ended
December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.

_Exceptional administrative gains/(expenses)._ An exceptional administrative gain of €8.9 million
was credited in the year ended December 31, 2021, which related to the final true-up of the original closure
cost provision made in December 2019 in respect of the Nitriles facility at Seal Sands, UK following
lower than expected demolition costs. Exceptional administrative expenses of €8.9 million were charged for
the year ended December 31, 2020, which related to a provision for early retirement costs as part of a
restructuring of the Köln site within the O&P Europe business.

_Operating profit._ Operating profit increased by €2,204.5 million, or 334.1%, to €2,864.4 million
for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to €659.9 million for the year ended December 31,
2020.

_Share of (loss)/profit of associates and joint ventures using the equity accounting method._ Share of
(loss)/profit of associates and joint ventures using the equity accounting method was a loss of €42.5 million
for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to €210.0 million for the year ended December 31,
2020. The share of loss of associates and joint ventures using the equity accounting method primarily
reflected the Group’s share of the results of the Refining joint venture with PetroChina as margins in the
European refining market have remained weak during 2021. In 2020 refining volumes were adversely impacted
by the COVID-19 virus pandemic which reduced demand for many refined products. In addition falling
crude oil prices during 2020 resulted in significant inventory holding losses for the year ended December 31,
2020.

_Profit on disposal of investments._ Profit on disposal of investments for the year ended December 31,
2020 was €78.3 million and related to the disposal of the Group’s previously held equity interest in the
Gemini HDPE joint venture following the Group’s acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in the joint
venture from Sasol on December 31, 2020.

_Profit on disposal of fixed assets._ Profit on disposal of fixed assets for the year ended December 31,
2021 was €0.3 million as compared to €1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

_Profit before net finance costs._ Profit before net finance costs increased by €2,292.9 million, or
433.2%, to €2,822.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to €529.3 million for the
year ended December 31, 2020.


-----

_Total Finance income._ Total finance income decreased by €70.1 million, or 22.0%, to €248.2 million
for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to €318.3 million for the year ended December 31,
2020. The decrease in total finance income for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 2020
primarily reflected a decrease in foreign exchange gains and interest income on cash balances and other loan
receivables, partly offset by an increase in net fair value gains on derivatives. The decrease in net foreign
exchange gains primarily associated with short-term intra-group funding was an exchange movements gain
of €121.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to an exchange movements gain of
€250.2 million for the same period in 2020. This was partly offset by a net fair value gain on derivatives of
€76.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to a net fair value gain of €5.8 million
for the same period in 2020.

_Finance costs before exceptional items._ Finance costs before exceptional items increased by
€228.8 million, or 77.2%, to €525.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to
€296.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in finance costs for the year ended
December 31, 2021 primarily reflected an increase in foreign exchange losses primarily associated with
short-term intra-group funding which was a loss of €234.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 as
compared to a loss of €21.8 million for the same period in 2020. There were also additional interest and
amortization of issue costs on the Senior Secured Term Loans and Senior Secured Notes due March 2026
issued in October 2020.

_Exceptional finance costs._ Exceptional finance costs of €3.5 million were charged for the year
ended December 31, 2021 following the write-off of deferred issue costs as a result of the early redemption
of the Senior Notes due 2024 in November 2021.

_Profit before tax._ Profit before tax increased by €1,990.5 million, or 361.0%, to €2,541.9 million
for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to €551.4 million for the year ended December 31,
2020.

_Tax (charge)/credit._ Tax charge increased by €474.4 million, to a charge of €449.6 million for the
year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to a credit of €24.8 million for the year ended December 31,
2020 primarily due to the increased profitability of the Group. In 2020, the Group recognized tax refunds due
in the United States in accordance with the recently enacted CARES Act. This Act allowed the Group to
carry back net operating losses in the United States for a period of up to five years to obtain retroactive tax
refunds at the tax rates applicable for the years the losses are utilized. Net operating losses were created in
the United States by the application of 100% tax depreciation on significant capital expenditure projects that
were placed into service in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The effective tax rate for the
Group for the year ended December 31, 2021 was lower than the standard rate in Luxembourg of 24.94%,
as profits were made in regions with lower rates (such as the United Kingdom and Switzerland) which more
than offset profits made in regions with higher rates than the standard rate (such as Germany and Belgium).

_Profit for the year._ Profit for the year increased by €1,516.1 million, or 263.1%, to €2,092.3 million
for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to €576.2 million for the year ended December 31,
2020.

**_O&P North America_**

_Revenue._ Revenue in the O&P North America segment increased by €2,742.3 million, or 98.5%,
to €5,527.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to €2,785.0 million for the year
ended December 31, 2020. The increase was driven by higher prices and higher volumes in the year ended
December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The weighted average sales price for
the whole business was higher in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in
2020, as the olefins, polymers and pipe businesses all experienced a rise in prices during 2021. Sales volumes
increased by approximately 11% in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in
2020 driven by higher sales volumes within the olefins, polymers and pipe businesses. The increase in the
olefin volumes was driven by the debottleneck project at the Chocolate Bayou, United States site and
additional feedstock sales. The increase in additional polyethylene volumes was mainly due to the acquisition
of the remaining 50% interest in the HDPE plant at the Battleground site in Texas, United States on
December 31, 2020.

_EBITDA before exceptionals._ EBITDA before exceptionals in the O&P North America segment
increased by €1,023.0 million, or 184.6%, to €1,577.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as
compared to €554.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in the year ended
December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was driven by higher margins and
volumes. Margins were higher across all product lines in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to
the same period in 2020, particularly polyethylene and polypropylene, due to a combination of strong
demand from a resurgent U.S. economy and industry supply constraints, while olefin margins benefitted
from a tighter market. Total sales volumes increased approximately 11% in the year ended December 31, 2021
as compared to the same period in 2020 driven by higher sales volumes within the olefins, polymers and
pipe businesses. Inventory holding gains were €75 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared
to inventory holding gains of €54 million in the same period in 2020. Partially offsetting the increase in
EBITDA before exceptionals was the depreciation of the U.S. dollar by approximately 5% against the euro
in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 which decreased the reported
euro results.

**_O&P Europe_**

_Revenue._ Revenue in the O&P Europe segment increased by €2,867.7 million, or 61.6%, to
€7,526.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to €4,658.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020. The increase in revenues was driven by higher selling prices and increased sales volumes
in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in
selling prices was driven by the general price environment, which was higher in the year ended December 31,
2021 as compared to the same period in 2020, as crude oil prices increased to an average of $71 per barrel
for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to an average of $42 per barrel for the year ended
December 31, 2020, which in turn led to an increase in prices across all product lines. The naphtha price
increased continuously throughout 2021, averaging 71% higher than in 2020. Feedstock, such as butane and
propane also rose by 90% and 85% respectively in 2021 as compared to 2020. Sales prices also saw strong
increases reflecting the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, healthy demand and tight markets.
Sales volumes increased by approximately 10% in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the


-----

same period in 2020 driven by higher olefin and polypropylene volumes which reflected the market
recovery in 2021, as 2020 was adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

_EBITDA before exceptionals._ EBITDA before exceptionals in the O&P Europe segment increased
by €552.9 million, or 139.9%, to €948.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to
€395.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The results for the year ended December 31, 2021
increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 due to higher margins, increased volumes and
higher inventory holding gains. Sales volumes increased by approximately 10% in the year ended December 31,
2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 driven by higher olefin and polypropylene volumes. Inventory
holding gains were €204 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to losses of €97 million
in the year ended December 31, 2020. The inventory holding gains were driven by the increase in feedstock
prices, particularly naphtha, butane and propane which all experienced significant increases during the
year ended December 31, 2021. Overall margins increased in 2021 as compared to 2020 following higher
olefin margins due to a stronger market, with demand for butadiene and benzene being particularly strong
as compared to the unfavorable market conditions in 2020. The polymers business experienced an increase in
margins due to logistical challenges in the market which reduced the level of European imports, coupled
with strong U.S. and European demand in both the durables and consumables markets. The Trading &
Shipping business experienced lower margins in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same
period in 2020 as higher freight costs adversely impacted profitability.

**_Chemical Intermediates_**

_Revenue._ Revenue in the Chemical Intermediates segment increased by €3,143.3 million, or
58.7%, to €8,496.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to €5,352.9 million for the
year ended December 31, 2020. The Oxide business revenues increased in the year ended December 31, 2021
as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 driven by higher prices and increased sales volumes.
Overall prices increased in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020, as
pricing closely followed the rise in underlying raw material costs of ethylene and propylene, with high demand
and limited supply also contributing to rising prices. Sales volumes were approximately 8% higher in the
year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020, most notably in the commodity area
where ethylene and propylene glycols performed much stronger due to the absence of U.S. imports as a
result of the extreme weather seen in Texas in early 2021, outages at some competitors and improved demand
due to the resurgence of the economy from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Oligomers business revenues
were higher in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 as a
result of higher prices and increased sales volumes. Regional prices ordinarily move in line with the underlying
raw material prices of ethylene and naphtha. Regional feedstock prices were higher in the year ended
December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 with higher European and U.S. ethylene prices
and increased naphtha prices impacting selling prices. Sales volumes were approximately 5% higher in the
year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 as LAO, PAO and SO
all experienced higher sales volumes. The increase in sales volumes were primarily due to strong demand
across most customer industries as economies began to open up again from the COVID-19-related disruptions
experienced during 2020. LAO volumes also benefitted from additional production from the new LAO
plant at Chocolate Bayou, United States which became operational in the fourth quarter of 2021. Nitriles
revenues increased in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020,
driven by higher prices. The average acrylonitrile sales price increased by 75% in the year ended
December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020, driven by higher propylene prices and the U.S.
market predominately being cost plus pricing. Excluding the impact of the closure of the Seal Sands, UK
plant in December 2020, the sales volumes of acrylonitrile for the year ended December 31, 2021 was in line
with the volumes achieved in 2020 despite limited product availability from unplanned outages at Green
Lake and a force majeure declaration in Köln during 2021. The Phenol business revenues increased in the
year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, driven primarily by higher
prices and increased volumes. Selling prices moved in line with the underlying raw material prices with
acetone and phenol prices moving significantly higher due to historically high U.S. and European propylene
and benzene feedstock prices as well as a tighter market in 2021. Sales volumes were approximately 11%
higher in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result
of higher phenol and acetone sales. The increased volumes were driven by much improved European demand
in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020.

_EBITDA before exceptionals._ EBITDA before exceptionals in the Chemical Intermediates
segment increased by €505.3 million, or 86.3%, to €1,090.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as
compared to €585.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Oxide business results for the year


-----

ended December 31, 2021 increased as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, mainly driven by
record margins and increased volumes. The increase in margins in the year ended December 31, 2021 as
compared to the same period in 2020 was driven by commodity products with glycol margins and volumes
both increasing due to lower U.S. imports related to the after-effects of the earlier freezing weather
conditions in Texas at the start of 2021, competitor outages and strong European and Asian demand. EO
and EO derivatives also experienced increased margins due to improved European demand from a resurgent
economy. The Oligomers business profitability increased in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared
with the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of increased sales volumes and higher margins. Sales
volumes were approximately 5% higher in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2020 as LAO, PAO and SO all experienced higher sales volumes primarily due to strong
demand across most customer industries as economies began to open up again from COVID-19-related
disruptions. Overall margins were higher in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared with the year
ended December 31, 2020 which was driven by higher LAO margins in North America and Asia. The increase
in overall margins was partly offset by lower PAO and SO margins which were adversely impacted by
higher production and conversion costs. The Nitriles business experienced an increase in profitability in the
year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, due to higher margins
and lower fixed costs. Margins were higher in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year
ended December 31, 2020 due to stronger market conditions, as recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic
continued throughout 2021 with average acrylonitrile margins increasing by 39% for the year ended
December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Fixed costs were lower in the year
ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 mainly due to the cost savings from the
closure of the Seal Sands, UK plant in December 2020. The Phenol business profitability increased in the year
ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to higher
margins and increased volumes. Volumes were higher in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to
the same period in 2020, driven by higher phenol and acetone volumes following significantly improved
European demand during 2021. Margins were higher in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to
the same period in 2020, driven by higher European and U.S. benzene prices and increased phenol adders
in 2021, partly offset by weaker acetone margins.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

**_Capital Resources_**

Our historical liquidity requirements have arisen primarily from the need for us to meet our debt
service requirements, to fund capital expenditures for the general maintenance and expansion of our
production facilities and for new facilities, and to fund growth in our working capital.

Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations of subsidiaries, cash on our
balance sheet and borrowings under the Securitization Program and Inventory Financing Facility. Our
ability to generate cash from our operations depends on future operating performance, which is in turn
dependent, to some extent, on general economic, financial, competitive market, legislative, regulatory and
other factors, many of which are beyond our control.

We believe that our operating cash flows, together with the cash resources and future borrowings
under the Securitization Program, the Project ONE Facilities and Inventory Financing Facility, will be
sufficient to fund our working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures and debt service
requirements as they become due, although this may not be the case.

We have also historically paid dividends to our shareholders. We may make strategic decisions,
including the payment of dividends, the size of which may change or increase from time to time, depending
on the performance of the business, and may not necessarily be in line with past practice.

In addition, we may engage in strategic transactions, including future debt incurrence in the capital
and leverage finance markets, including inventory financing or similar arrangements, or repurchases of our
debt (on the open market or otherwise) with cash on hand or from the proceeds of future debt incurrences,
which may impact the availability of cash resources.

**_Financing Arrangements_**

The Group’s capital structure includes a mixture of secured term loans and secured notes. These
various debt instruments are denominated in both euro and U.S. dollars where appropriate, to approximately
match the main currencies of the cash flows generated by the Group’s operations.


-----

The Group has a €800.0 million Securitization Program in place, which matures in December 2026.
The Group also has an Inventory Financing Facility in place, which matures in June 2024, although this is
extendable by mutual agreement.

The Group has a €300.0 million LC Facility in place. Under the terms of the facility the Group
undertakes to provide cash collateral to cover any letters of credit, guarantees, bonds or indemnities issued
under the facility.

Following the Group’s purchase of the remaining 50% interest in the Noretyl ethylene cracker at
Rafnes, Norway from the Kerling group in July 2015, the Group assumed the obligations of a loan facility
of Noretyl AS. In November 2019, following the repayment of the initial loan, the loan facility was amended
and restated with a new facility amount of €250.0 million. In November 2022 the Group amended and
extended the existing Rafnes facility to €305.0 million, resulting in an additional drawdown of €126.5 million.
The new facility matures in November 2027.

As part of a project at the Group’s Köln site to replace part of its incineration or cogeneration
unit, the Group entered into a €120.0 million loan facility, which matures in December 2024, together with
a €60.0 million additional loan facility which matures in June 2026.

As part of the Group’s purchase of the remaining 50% interest in the Gemini HDPE plant in
Texas, USA, from Sasol Chemicals on December 31, 2020, the Group amended and upsized the existing
Gemini Term Loan facility within the acquired legal entity, an Unrestricted Subsidiary. The amended loan
facility was upsized to $600.0 million and matures on October 31, 2027.

As of September 30, 2023, excluding unamortized debt issuance costs, the Group had a total of
€5,266.3 million Senior Secured Term Loans, €802.3 million Senior Secured Notes due 2028, €550.0 million
Senior Secured Notes due 2025, €325.0 million Senior Secured Notes due March 2026 and €770.0 million
Senior Secured Notes due May 2026.

As part of the Group’s purchase of the 50% interest in the SECCO joint venture in Shanghai,
China from Sinopec on December 31, 2022, the Group entered into the Rain Facilities with an aggregate
principal amount of RMB 1,045 million and $525.0 million through an Unrestricted Subsidiary. In April 2023,
the Group successfully completed syndication of the Rain Facilities increasing the Rain Facilities to
RMB 1,045 million and $785.0 million. The Rain Facilities are fully drawn, guaranteed by IGH and IHL,
and mature in June 2026.

In addition, on December 22, 2022, the Group entered into project financing agreements in
connection with Project ONE to borrow loans of up to €3.5 billion to fund the majority of the capital
expenditure plus associated financing costs during construction. The Project ONE Facilities are, during the
construction phase, supported by debt service undertakings provided by IGH, IHL and INEOS US I Inc.
We expect the Project ONE Facilities to be drawn in stages, beginning in the first quarter of 2023 and
throughout the construction period to 2026. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Rain Facilities”
and “Description of Other Indebtedness—Project ONE Facilities.”

We or our affiliates may repay, redeem or repurchase any of our outstanding debt instruments,
including term loans and notes, at any time and from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated
transactions, pursuant to one or more tender or exchange offers or otherwise, upon such terms and with
such consideration as we or any such affiliate may determine. The amounts involved may be material.

**_Capital Expenditures_**

As part of our strategy to focus capital investments on improving returns, we have instituted
measures to ensure the most efficient uses of capital investment. We intend to manage capital expenditures
to maintain our well-invested asset base.

Capital expenditure incurred during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 and the
nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 were €1,036.4 million, €809.0 million, €1,311.0 million,

turnaround on one of the crackers at Chocolate Bayou, United States, together with expenditure on an
office building at the site and a number of smaller turnarounds and projects. The main capital expenditures
in the O&P Europe segment were at the Köln, Germany site on completion of the cogeneration project
and further expenditure on a new jetty, together with a major scheduled turnaround on one of the crackers
at the site. In addition, there was expenditure on a planned propane dehydrogenation unit (the “PDH
**Unit”) and new ethane cracker at the Antwerp, Belgium site (the PDH Unit was subsequently cancelled and**

impaired). The main expenditure in the Chemical Intermediates segment was further growth expenditure by
the Oligomers business on the LAO and PAO platforms as well as a barge dock. There was also expenditure
within the Oxide business at the Antwerp, Belgium site in respect of a planned turnaround. The Phenol
business also had expenditure on a new cumene unit project at Marl, Germany. The remaining capital
expenditure related primarily to sustenance expenditure.

We expect that our aggregate capital expenditure for 2023 will be approximately €1.5 billion, which
includes €0.7 billion in relation to Project ONE. We expect that our aggregate capital expenditure for 2024
will be approximately €1.85 billion, which includes €1.5 billion in relation to Project ONE.

**_Working Capital_**

We anticipate that our working capital requirements will vary due to changes in raw material costs,
which affect inventory and account receivables levels, and sales volumes. Working capital levels typically
develop in line with raw material prices, although timing factors can affect flows of capital. We expect to fund
our working capital requirements with cash generated from operations and drawings under our
Securitization Program and Inventory Financing Facility.

**_Cash Flows_**

During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 and the nine-month periods ended
September 30, 2023 and 2022, our net cash flow was as follows:

_Cash flows from operating activities_

Net cash flow from operating activities was an inflow of €1,275.3 million for the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2023 (inflow of €2,023.3 million in the nine-month period ended September 30,
2022). The inflow was due to the profit generated from operations and working capital inflows of
€237.0 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 (outflow of €321.4 million in the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2022). The working capital inflows in the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2023 primarily reflected the lower working capital levels of the Group due to lower
sales volumes.

Net cash flow from operating activities was an inflow of €2,740.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022 (inflow of €2,738.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021). The inflow was due
to the profit generated from operations and working capital inflows of €41.6 million in the year ended
December 31, 2022 (outflows of €736.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2021). The working
capital inflows in the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily reflected the lower working capital levels of
the Group due to a reduction in overall sales volumes of approximately 4% for the year ended December 31,
2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021.

Net cash flow from operating activities was an inflow of €2,738.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021 compared to an inflow of €1,886.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The
inflow was due to the profit generated from operations, partly offset by working capital outflows of
€736.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to an inflow of €319.0 million for the year
ended December 31, 2020. The working capital outflows for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily
reflected the higher working capital levels of the Group due to increased raw material prices, and
consequently product prices, as crude oil prices increased significantly to an average of $71 per barrel for
the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to an average of $42 per barrel for the year ended
December 31, 2020. In addition, overall sales volumes increased by approximately 9% for the year ended
December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 which also resulted in higher levels
of working capital.

Taxation payments of €192.3 million were made in the nine-month period ended September 30,
2023 (payments of €112.8 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022). The payments in


-----

the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 primarily reflected tax payments in Germany, UK,
Belgium, Norway, USA and Canada. The payments in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022
primarily reflected tax payments in US, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium and Canada, partially offset by tax
refunds in the US (including a refund under the CARES Act).

Taxation payments of €148.1 million were made in the year ended December 31, 2022 (payments
of €109.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021). The payments in the year ended December 31,
2022 primarily reflected tax payments in Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, Canada and the United States,
partially offset by tax refunds in the United States (including a refund under the CARES Act).

Taxation payments of €109.7 million were made for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared
to receipts of €68.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The payments for the year ended
December 31, 2021 primarily reflected tax payments in Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, Norway, Canada
and the United States, some of which had been deferred from 2020 in response to the coronavirus pandemic.
These payments were partially offset by further tax refunds of $270.7 million from the United States
under the CARES Act.

ONE to borrow loans of up to €3.5 billion under the Project ONE Facilities to fund the majority of the
capital expenditure plus associated financing costs during construction. In February 2023 the Group received

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk**

In the ordinary course of our business, we are exposed to a variety of market risks arising from
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. To manage these risks
effectively, we may enter into hedging transactions and use derivative financial instruments, pursuant to
established internal guidelines and policies, to mitigate the adverse effects of these market risks. We do not
enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

In the case of commodities, this exposure principally arises from movements in the prices of the
feedstocks we require to make our products. To manage this exposure, we generally acquire raw materials
and sell finished products at posted or market-related prices, which are typically set on a quarterly, monthly
or more frequent basis in line with industry practice. We seek to minimize reductions in our margins by
passing through feedstock cost increases to our customers through higher prices for our products.

Our cash flows and earnings are subject to exchange rate fluctuations. In our European petrochemical
business, product prices, certain feedstock costs and most other costs are denominated in euro and British
pounds. From time to time, we may enter into foreign currency exchange instruments to minimize the
short-term impact of movements in foreign exchange rates.

**Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements**

We have reviewed our selection and application of principal accounting policies and related
financial disclosures. The preceding discussion of past performance is based upon our consolidated
financial information, which has been prepared in accordance with IFRS. Our significant accounting
policies are described in Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial information. The application of these
accounting policies requires that management make estimates and judgments. On an ongoing basis, we
evaluate our estimates, which are based on historical experience and market and other conditions, and on
assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Actual results may differ from these estimates due to actual
market and other conditions, and assumptions being significantly different than was anticipated at the time of
the preparation of these estimates. Such differences may affect our financial results. We have chosen to
highlight certain policies that we consider critical to the operations of our business and understanding our
consolidated financial information. These policies have been discussed and agreed upon with our audit
committee. We believe the following estimates affect the application of our most critical accounting
policies and require our most significant judgments.

The following area is considered to involve a significant degree of judgment or estimation (this
section should be read in conjunction with notes 1 and 31 to the consolidated financial statements of
INEOS Group Holdings S.A. as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020, December 31, 2021 and


-----

note 30 of the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively
(included elsewhere in this offering memorandum).

**_Taxation_**

Management is required to estimate the tax payable in each of the jurisdictions in which the Group
operates. This involves estimating the actual current tax charge or credit together with assessing temporary
differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. The calculation of the
Group’s total tax charge necessarily involves a significant degree of estimation in respect of certain items
whose tax treatment cannot be finally determined until resolution has been reached with the relevant tax
authority or, as appropriate, through a formal legal process.

The Group has, from time to time, contingent tax liabilities arising from trading and corporate
transactions in the countries in which it operates. After appropriate consideration, management makes
provision for these liabilities based on the probable level of economic loss that may be incurred and which
is reliably measurable.

The breadth of the Group’s structure with operations in many geographic locations makes the use
of estimates and assumptions more challenging. The resolution of issues is not always within the control of
the Group and can be reliant upon the efficiency of the legal processes in the relevant jurisdictions in
which the Group operates, and as a result, issues can, and often do, take many years to resolve.

**Impairment**

Goodwill impairment testing is performed annually or if there is an indication of impairment.
Goodwill impairments tests are based on cash generating units and compare the recoverable amount of the
unit with the respective carrying amount. The recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating unit is
the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. The value in use is determined using a
discounted cash flow method, considering earnings forecasts of the unit. The management of the Group
identified the operating segments as cash generating units (CGU) for purposes of testing goodwill for
impairment. Each unit or group of units to which goodwill is allocated shall represent the lowest level within
the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purpose. The goodwill is internally
monitored at the level of business units.

Impairment losses on intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are recognized when the
recoverable amount of the cash generating unit which includes the asset is lower than the respective carrying
amount. In accordance with the definition of a cash generating unit under IAS 36, the individual production
plants generally do not represent separate cash generating units, but are part of larger asset groups that
form the cash generating units. Since the assessment of whether goodwill or property, plant and equipment
are impaired is based on long-term business plans for the cash generating units and the determination of
an appropriate discount rate, management used significant estimates and assumptions in making these
assessments.

**Post-Retirement Benefits**

The Group operates a number of defined benefit post-employment schemes. Under IAS 19
Revised Employee Benefits, management is required to estimate the present value of the future defined
benefit obligation of each of the defined benefit schemes. The costs and year end obligations under defined
benefit schemes are determined using actuarial valuations. The actuarial valuations involve making
numerous assumptions, including:

     - Future rate of increase in salaries;

     - Inflation rate projections;

     - Discount rate for scheme liabilities; and

    - Expected rates of return on the scheme assets.

**Investments**

The Group applies IFRS 11 to all joint arrangements. Under IFRS 11, investments in joint
arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures depending on the contractual rights
and obligations of each investor.


-----

The key accounting judgement taken in the preparation of the financial statements relates to our
interest in the Refining Business formerly owned by Group. The Refining Business is now owned by Petro
China and INEOS Investments, which in turn is held under common control by the Group’s controlling
shareholders. The Group had an economic interest in INEOS Investments via non-voting ordinary shares
in INEOS Investments until December 2022, when these shares were sold to a related party.

The Group has evaluated its interest in INEOS Investments and in the Refining Business, and has
concluded that, until the sale in December 2022, it had effective control over INEOS Investments by virtue
of the facts that the Group is subject to exposure and rights to the variable returns from INEOS Investments,
INEOS Investments was held under common control with the Group’s controlling shareholders and had
the same directors as the Group. As a result, INEOS Investments was treated as a subsidiary of the Group,
and therefore the Refining Business was treated as a joint venture under the equity accounting method,
and the Group reflected its 50% share in the profits and losses of the Refining Business in its income
statement.

**Overview**

The petrochemicals markets comprise all products derived from crude oil and natural gas, and
include olefins, polymers and various petrochemical chemical intermediate products directly or indirectly
derived from olefins. We participate in the majority of these market segments, with a significant proportion
of our profitability being derived from the chemical intermediates sector.

In the refining industry, crude oil is refined into a number of products, including naphtha and
liquid petroleum gas, a significant proportion of which is used as feedstock for the production of olefins,
such as ethylene and propylene. In turn, a significant portion of these olefins are used as feedstock for the
manufacture of polymers and petrochemical derivatives, such as chemical intermediates.

Olefins are the basic building blocks used to create a variety of petrochemical products.
Petrochemicals are widely used in consumer and industrial applications ranging from plastics and packaging
to construction and cosmetics. Owing to their physical properties and affordability, petrochemicals and
their derivatives continue to replace more traditional materials, such as metal, glass, ceramics and wood, in
an expanding list of end-use applications.

Chemical intermediates are high value-added chemical products used as key components in a wide
variety of consumer and industrial products. The chemical intermediates industry is less cyclical than the
olefins industry; however, demand for chemical intermediate products is affected by trends in demand in the
various industries that are end users of the products.

The industry overview detailed below summarizes the outlook for our key activities in the
petrochemical and chemical intermediates industries.

**Olefins & Polyolefins**

**_Overview_**

Olefins are the basic building blocks used to create a wide variety of petrochemical products. The
key olefins manufactured by the petrochemical industry are ethylene and propylene and these olefins are in
turn used to produce polyolefins and other olefin derivatives, such as ethylene oxide, acrylonitrile, vinyl
chloride monomer, cumene and oxo-alcohols. Butadiene, benzene and other aromatics are co-products of
olefin manufacture, produced primarily from steam cracking of naphtha. Polyolefins is the term used to
collectively describe polypropylene and polyethylene polymers, the world’s most widely used plastic materials.
Polyolefins are manufactured by the process of polymerization whereby individual molecules of ethylene
and propylene are aggregated in polymer chains.

**_Manufacturing_**

Olefins are produced primarily by the steam cracking of hydrocarbon feedstocks. In steam
cracking, a gaseous or liquid hydrocarbon feed, such as naphtha, liquefied petroleum gas or ethane, is
diluted with steam and briefly heated in a furnace without the presence of oxygen. Typically, the reaction


-----

temperature is very high, at around 850°C, but the reaction is only allowed to take place very briefly. In
modern cracking furnaces, the reaction time is further reduced to milliseconds, resulting in gas velocities
faster than the speed of sound, to improve yield. After the cracking temperature has been reached, the gas
is quickly quenched to stop the reaction in a transfer line heat exchanger. The products produced in the
reaction depend on the composition of the feed, the hydrocarbon-to-steam ratio and on the cracking
temperature and furnace residence time.

Light hydrocarbon feeds, such as ethane, liquefied petroleum gas or light naphtha, yield product
streams rich in the lighter alkenes, including ethylene, propylene and butadiene. Heavier hydrocarbon feeds
(full-range and heavy naphthas, as well as other refinery products) yield some of these products too, but also
yield products rich in aromatic hydrocarbons and hydrocarbons suitable for inclusion in gasoline or fuel
oil. Higher cracking temperatures (also referred to as higher levels of “severity”) favor the production of
ethylene and benzene, whereas lower cracking temperatures (lower levels of “severity”) produce higher
amounts of propylene, C4-hydrocarbons and liquid products.

Depending on feedstock, varying levels of ethylene, propylene and other by-products are achieved.
Ethane produces the most ethylene but the least propylene. Naphtha produces substantially less ethylene,
roughly one-third of that of ethane, but produces more propylene and significantly more by-products.

The main polyolefins are the thermoplastics, polyethylene and polypropylene, which are produced
by the polymerization of the olefin monomers ethylene and propylene, respectively. Polyolefins can either
be homopolymers (a combination of the same monomers) or copolymers (polymers that are produced from
a combination of two or more monomers).

Polyolefins are produced using a number of different technologies that are widely available,
including one high-pressure process and three low-pressure processes (Solution, Slurry and Gas Phase). All
of the technologies are constantly being adapted to improve product qualities and reduce production
costs. For commodity products, produced on modern scale technology, the cost structure of these technologies
is similar. Increased cost structures for producing specialty products are typically justified by premium
margins.

The following is a summary of the four processes:

**_High-Pressure Process_**

This was the original process used to produce polyethylene and is still in use today. This process is
a free radical polymerization that does not require the use of a catalyst, operating at pressures above 1,000
and up to 3,500 bar and temperatures from 150° to 340°C. Originally conducted in a high-pressure autoclave,
current processes more commonly use a tubular reactor. This process is used to produce low-density
polyethylene, characterized by long-chain branching, considerable flexibility and clarity. Because of the highpressures involved, this process involves higher risk than low-pressure processes and requires expensive
and specialized equipment; consequently, fewer high-pressure processes have been constructed in recent years.

**_Low-Pressure Processes_**

These processes typically operate below 200 bar and have lower capital intensity but require the aid
of a catalyst. In addition, it is common to add a comonomer (butene or hexene in the case of polyethylene,
and ethylene in the case of polypropylene) to tailor the resultant polymer properties.


-----

    - Solution Process. This process operates at temperatures above the melting point of the
polyolefin (above 130°C for polyethylene and above 140°C for polypropylene) and employs
metallocene or Ziegler-Natta catalysts and a solvent to dissolve the growing polymer chains. This
process is best suited to make high-density polyethylene (having very few chain branches, and
those branches that do exist are short-only a few carbon atoms in length) and linear low-density
polyethylene (having many short-chain branches, which may be contrasted to low-density
polyethylene with many long-chain branches). Solution processes have the ability to produce
narrow molecular weight distribution polyolefins.

    - Slurry (or Suspension) Process. This process is a continuous low temperature (60° – 105°C,
20 – 35 bar for polyethylene or 60° – 85°C, 35 – 50 bar for polypropylene) process in which
polymer forms as a solid particle in the presence of a catalyst while suspended in a liquid slurry.
In the case of polyethylene, the polymerization takes place in an inert liquid carrier such as
isobutane. In the case of polypropylene, the polymerization takes place in liquid hexane, heptane,
or even liquid propylene monomer. When propylene is utilized as the carrier liquid, the process
is often referred to as “bulk slurry.” The carrier liquid serves to aid in the removal of heat as it
carries the growing polymer particles through the reaction process. The catalyst may be
chromium on silica (polyethylene only), Ziegler-Natta, or metallocene. The reactor may be a
stirred tank or a pipe-loop reactor, in either case jacketed to aid in removal of the heat of reaction.
One or more reactors may be placed in series to broaden the molecular weight distribution and
produce bimodal polyolefins. This process is best suited to making high-density polyethylene and
homopolymer polypropylene. One advantage of this process over other high-density polyethylene
processes is the ability to make rapid grade transitions, which makes it particularly well suited to
the manufacture of specialty polyethylene products.

    - Gas Phase. As the name implies, polymerization occurs with the solid polymer particles
produced on a heterogeneous catalyst in the gas phase. Like the slurry process, the catalyst may
be chromium on silica (polyethylene only), Ziegler-Natta, or metallocene. In the reactor, the
growing polyolefin particles are fluidized and cooled by the gaseous reactants and/or nitrogen,
or sub-fluidized and mechanically agitated. Liquid monomer may be added and flashed to aid in
the removal of heat. The reaction takes place at low temperature (80°-100°C for polyethylene
and about 60°-85°C for polypropylene) and pressure (15-35 bar). A gas phase process has
advantages over slurry and solution processes in that the heat of reaction is very effectively
removed and operates with lower hydrocarbon inventories. In addition, high-ethylene content
copolymers of polypropylene can be produced in this process. This process is best suited to the
manufacture of linear low-density polyethylene, high-density polyethylene and all types of
polypropylene, including homopolymer, random copolymer, impact copolymer and soft
thermoplastic polyolefin.

Post-polymerization, any catalyst is deactivated, the polyolefin is freed of any solvent, unreacted
monomer or liquid diluent, and the resulting polyolefin flake or crumb is combined with additives and
extruded into pellets prior to sale to downstream fabricators.

Several of these technologies have recently been adapted to run multiple reactions in series,
yielding a product with a wider bi-modal molecular weight distribution that provides superior strength or
unique characteristics such as high-impact resistance.

All polyolefin groups participate in mature markets and therefore larger plants of all process
technologies are being built with capacities of 300,000-500,000 tonnes per year.

**_Feedstock_**

The predominant feedstock for Europe and North East Asia is naphtha. The Middle East
predominantly uses natural gas liquids (“NGLs”), although there is very little very low cost ethane available
for new crackers, which are designed to crack a range of the heavier NGLs (i.e., propane, butane and
heavier condensates). These feedstocks are tradable as fuel, and thus have a significant opportunity value,
which earlier tranches of essentially “distressed” ethane did not (ethane is not practically tradable as a fuel).
North American crackers have always had considerable in-built feedstock flexibility, enabling operators to
select the most economic feedstock (be it NGLs or naphtha) on the day. The recent widespread exploitation
of shale gas has caused fuel gas prices to fall well below those of other regions and has also given rise to
an abundance of associated NGLs (mainly ethane and propane). These NGLs are currently available to local
cracker operators at a fraction of the equivalent cost of naphtha, thus bestowing a large commercial


-----

advantage on North American NGL-based cracker operators. NGLs are the predominant feedstock for
North American crackers.

The prices of naphtha and NGLs are influenced by numerous factors, including the balance
between supply and demand, oil and gas prices, and geopolitical factors. Because gas is not as readily
transportable between regions as oil, and the amount of interregional trade in gas is therefore limited, gas
prices tend to vary by geographic region. In an environment of relatively high oil prices, olefin facilities
located in the Middle East enjoy the advantage of direct access to gas feedstocks, which are priced lower
than naphtha. Producers who are back-integrated to refineries have the ability to capture margins across the
value chain and to optimize feedstock types.

current fully delivered Northwest European pricing for ethylene are as follows:

**_Products_**

According to NexantECA, worldwide demand for petrochemical products has grown at a rate
greater than the growth rate of GDP over the last 15 years, reflecting in part the ongoing substitution of


-----

thermoplastics for other industrial materials, including paper, wood, glass and metal, and the change in
consumption patterns of developing nations. NexantECA projects demand growth for petrochemical products
to be moderate as compared to historical levels, but nonetheless to grow slightly faster than GDP on a
worldwide basis as this penetration matures in established markets, and despite petrochemical growth rates
which can be below GDP growth rates for certain products in North America and Western Europe. Between
2023 and 2028, NexantECA projects GDP to grow at an average annual growth rate of 2.3% in North
America, 1.9% in Western Europe and 4.1% in Northeast Asia. According to NexantECA, in Northeast
Asia, China’s economic growth over 2023-2028 is expected to ease to 4.9%, but the growth is still expected
to be higher than the other countries in the region.

NexantECA’s view of GDP and demand growth rates for petrochemical products varies by region
and product type, as detailed in the table below:

Set forth below is a description of the principal petrochemical products detailed above and their
applications.

    - Ethylene. According to NexantECA, ethylene is the world’s most widely used petrochemical in
terms of volume, accounting for over one-third of the global production of primary
petrochemicals. It is the key building block used to produce a large number of higher value
added chemicals, including polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride via ethylene dichloride and styrene
via ethylbenzene. Ethylene is a flammable gas and is a primary olefin obtained through a cracking
process, as described above. Because ethylene is a gas, it must be transported either by pipeline
or in the form of a highly pressurized and refrigerated liquid, which is an expensive means of
transportation.

While ethylene itself has no consumer applications, demand for ethylene is driven essentially by its
use as feedstock for various thermoplastics, including polyethylene and other polymer derivatives.
Thermoplastics are plastics that soften when heated and harden again when cooled. Aside from being the
feedstock for polyethylene production, demand for ethylene is also driven by the manufacture of ethylene
oxide and derivatives, ethylene dichloride and ethyl benzene. These products are in turn used mainly in the
production of other thermoplastics: PET, PVC and polystyrene, respectively. According to NexantECA,
the global market for ethylene is forecast to grow at 3.4% per annum through 2028 versus forecast GDP
growth of 3.2% during the same period, driven by polyethylene applications such as high-density polyethylene
and linear low-density polyethylene. The following table sets forth the historical and projected supply and
demand trends for ethylene globally.

- Propylene. Propylene is a flammable gas which is derived as a co-product either of the refinery
fluid catalytic cracker process used to make gasoline or of the steam cracking process used to
make ethylene. More recently, propylene is also being produced from processes such as propane
dehydrogenation and metathesis. Propylene is an important feedstock for a significant number of
industrial products and is the main feedstock for polypropylene and acrylonitrile. Propylene is
marginally easier to transport than ethylene and may be shipped by pipeline, road, rail or ship.

Global propylene demand is driven essentially by its use as feedstock for various thermoplastics
and by the level of demand for propylene derivatives, particularly polypropylene, propylene oxide,
acrylonitrile, oxo-alcohols, cumene and acrylic acid. Growth in the demand for polypropylene has stemmed
from the substitution of non-polymers (paper, wood, glass and metal, etc.) for polypropylene due to its
relative cost advantage and superior performance. According to NexantECA, the global market for propylene
is projected to grow at 3.7 % per annum through 2028, driven mainly by polypropylene demand.
NexantECA expects that the demand for polypropylene in Asia will continue to grow at higher rates than
North America and Europe, primarily as a result of growth in the Chinese market.

    - Butadiene. Butadiene is a gas and is one of the co-products of the steam cracking process used
to manufacture ethylene and propylene. Butadiene is used primarily in the production of
polymers, principally synthetic rubbers such as styrene-butadiene rubber, which is used to make
tires and other rubber products. Other polymers made from butadiene include acrylonitrilebutadiene styrene and styrene-butadiene latex. Butadiene is also used to make ethylidene
norbornene monomer.

NexantECA, the global market for butadiene is projected to grow at an average of 3.0% per annum through
2028. Demand is tightly linked to the market for synthetic rubber, which is, in turn, mainly consumed in
the automotive sector.

    - Benzene. Benzene is used to produce a number of petrochemical intermediates, such as styrene,
cumene for phenol and acetone, cyclohexane and nitrobenzene. It is mainly produced from
refinery processes or as a co-product of steam cracker operations.

Styrene is the largest chemical outlet for benzene at around 48% of demand. The second largest
outlet for benzene, accounting for 20% of demand, is cumene, which is nearly all consumed in phenol
production with acetone formed as a co-product. For 2023, NexantECA estimated the global benzene
demand to be 53.9 million tons, with 68 % being consumed in the production of ethylbenzene for the styrenics
industry and cumene for the phenolics industry. NexantECA forecasts an average global growth rate in
demand of approximately 3.3% per year in the 2023-2028 period.

    - Polyethylene. Polyethylene is the world’s most widely used thermoplastic and is made by the
polymerization of ethylene. Polyethylene is often classified by its density, because greater density
corresponds with greater material rigidity.

The world’s largest volume polyethylene is high density polyethylene (HDPE), which has a
relatively high degree of tensile strength. Plastic containers represent the most common household use of
high density polyethylene. At the opposite end of the spectrum is low density polyethylene (LDPE), which
was the first type of polyethylene to be developed. Flexible packaging represent the most common household
use of low density polyethylene. Both high density polyethylene and low density polyethylene are also
commonly used for molding applications. Linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), which was developed
in the 1970s, can usually be manufactured at a slightly lower cost than low density polyethylene and has
similar basic properties. While low density polyethylene and linear low density polyethylene are to a
certain extent substitutable for each other, one may be more suitable than the other for a specific application.

Film is the largest single use of global polyethylene production and the primary driver of demand,
representing approximately one half of worldwide polyethylene consumption. Film includes a myriad of
end use applications, from food packaging to trash bags, stretch films and shrink films. Blow molding and
injection molding are the next largest uses and are also important demand drivers. In the blow molded
category, blow molded bottles are the single largest end use. NexantECA forecasts an average global
growth rate in demand for polyethylene of approximately 3.7% per year in the 2023-2028 period.

    - Polypropylene. Polypropylene is the world’s second most widely used thermoplastic after
polyethylene and is among the fastest growing categories of thermoplastics. It is manufactured
by the polymerization of propylene. The rapid growth of polypropylene-based products reflects
the superior cost and performance characteristics of this material. As one of the industry’s most
versatile polymers, polypropylene is achieving a portion of its growth by displacing other
polymers, such as polyethylene and polystyrene.

The largest end use segment of the polypropylene industry is injection molding, followed by film
and sheet applications. Injection molded polypropylene includes a wide variety of end uses, such as
packaging, automotive and appliances. End use segments for films and sheets include food bags, tape and
wrappings for consumer goods. Polypropylene is a thermoplastic characterized by its rigidity and resistance
to high temperatures, chemicals and fatigue combined with a greater density. Polypropylene has a heat
distortion temperature of 140°C to 200°C, which makes it particularly suitable for “hot fill” applications,
which are manufactured using injection molding. As a result, polypropylene is the most significant material
used in molded containers and automotive applications. Polypropylene fibers are also used in fabrics and
carpets.

According to NexantECA, the global polypropylene market is projected to grow at 4.2% per
annum through 2028. NexantECA expects that the demand for polypropylene in Asia will continue to grow
at higher rates than North America and Europe, primarily as a result of growth in the Chinese market.

**_Market Environment_**

Although the major costs of production are related to the costs of the relevant feedstocks and the
scale of operation, the olefins industry is primarily regional. This is due to high transportation costs. Prices
are also indirectly arbitraged by the trade flows in olefin derivatives (principally polymers), the markets
for which are becoming increasingly global. Polyolefins, in common with other segments of the chemicals
industry, are subject to cyclical supply and demand, although polyolefin demand growth has been historically
strong, driven by the broadening range of end uses.

The petrochemical industry is highly commoditized. Some polyolefins have subgrades that have
properties enabling them to be differentiated from commodity grades. These products account for a small
portion of the overall market, but carry a premium in the market and allow differentiation in the sector.

The construction of a new olefin manufacturing unit takes approximately five years from initial
design to completion. Producers are more likely to add capacity in periods when current or expected future
demand is strong and margins are, or are expected to be, high. Investments in new capacity can result in
overcapacity, which typically leads to a reduction of margins. In response to falling margins, producers
typically shut uncompetitive assets or limit further capacity additions, eventually causing the market to be
relatively undersupplied. The alternation between periods of substantial capacity addition and periods of
limited capacity addition or reduction results in recognizable swings in petrochemical capacity utilization,
which typically result in swings in industry margins. This long-term pattern is often referred to as the
petrochemical cycle. The point in time of a given cycle with the lowest average margin across a product line
is referred to as the “bottom of the cycle.” The point with the highest average margin is called the “peak
of the cycle.”

According to NexantECA, ethylene capacity grew by 12.5 million tons in 2022, while consumption
increased by only 1.1 million tons as the market struggled with recessionary and inflationary pressures.
Operating rates dropped by five percent globally as a result and are set to remain at trough levels until around
2027. The North American petrochemical industry has benefitted greatly due to the abundance of low
NGL feedstocks as well as low energy costs. While U.S. gas prices have historically shown a strong correlation
with oil prices, they have now decoupled due to the abundant supply from shale gas exploitation. NGLbased ethylene production in the United States remains highly competitive relative to other regions. The
growth in NGL supply in North America sparked a wave of investment in new capacity in the United States
which has now passed its peak. In a market where the marginal production is from oil-based capacity, the
cost basis for oil-based production sets the global price level. Export competitiveness and profitability of U.S.
producers depends to a large extent on crude oil prices which set the prices of ethylene derivatives via
naphtha cracking economics. The high crude oil prices since late 2021 have therefore ensured favorable
conditions for U.S. ethylene production. While Europe suffers from stubbornly slow demand growth, and


-----

high energy costs, its producers have benefitted from high valuations from the heavier steam cracker coproducts. Several steam crackers in Europe have been closed, and some further closures of higher cost plants
may now be necessary as a result of weak demand and poor competitiveness versus North America and
the Middle East.

INEOS has taken the lead in securing ethane exports from the United States, now followed by
SABIC and Borealis. Furthermore, ExxonMobil and TotalEnergies also now purchase ethane from the new
storage facilities built by INEOS in Europe. Despite project delays due to issues with environmental
permitting and very high construction costs, the U.S. ethylene capacity build is now toward the higher
range of expectations. Energy security concerns and the increased LNG demand from Europe to replace
Russian gas is supportive of shale exploitation, with the Biden administration calling for increased production
and export capacity.

With little additional low-priced feedstock available in the Middle East, Chinese capacity
developments occupy an increasing share of forecast capacity growth. According to NexantECA, Saudi
Aramco is, however, aiming to develop unconventional gas production and use its “TC2C” (thermal crude
to chemicals) technology to convert crude oil into chemical feedstocks. These two initiatives should provide
for higher capacity growth in the Middle East in the medium term, although there are currently no firm
projects relating specifically to these new sources of supply.

Additions of methanol-to-olefins (MTO) capacity in China are now much reduced according to
NexantECA, and capacity growth in China is from several new and very large refinery-integrated steam
crackers, and coastal crackers based mostly on NGLs imported from the United States.

Addition of new ethylene capacity averaged below six million tons per year from 2015-2019, but
accelerated to 11 million tons per year over 2020-2022. Capacity addition has remained high throughout
2023, but will decline significantly beginning in 2024. Expansion of the supply base in recent years has been
largely due to new investments in Asia, with capacity growth in the United States now restricted to one
active cracker project. In NexantECA’s view, Asia will continue to lead global capacity investments in the
coming years with steam cracker developments in China and other Asian countries such as India, Indonesia
and South Korea. The ethylene capacity base in Asia will expand by a total of 18 million tons per year
over 2023-2028, while capacity growth in North America will be around 8 million tons per year. NexantECA
states that ethylene production in China from methanol peaked at 22% in 2017, but declined to 14% by
2023 as a result of more rapid addition of steam cracking capacity and very high coal prices in China. High
coal prices and the dual-control emissions legislation count against new MTO project development.
Investments in North America, stimulated by abundant supplies of low cost NGL, have driven a resurgence
in new capacity, although capacity addition in the United States has also now dropped. NexantECA states
that U.S. ethylene capacity increased by 16 million tons per year over 2015-2023, and that only six million tons
of new U.S. ethylene capacity may be seen in the U.S. by 2028. Only around two million tons per year of
firm capacity developments are currently underway, while some other projects are under discussion. Ethylene
is consumed in many diverse products and industry sectors, however overall consumption is largely driven
by economic activity. It is important to note that the world needs approximately 6 million tons per annum of
new capacity to meet growth at the rate that NexantECA predicts of 3.4% per annum over 2023-2028.
This means 4 to 5 new crackers per year just to meet global growth. Exports of surplus ethane are driving
modifications of existing crackers in other regions, and also some new NGL cracking capacity is under
development in China, which is to be based on imported ethane and propane, as well as some new domestic
supply. Reduced availability of advantaged feedstocks will restrict future investments in the Middle East,
and following the startup of Sadara, there is currently only one firm cracker project in Saudi Arabia. Ethylene
capacity is being added in Iran, but supply growth is contingent on a significant near-term increase in
ethane supply. Despite commissioning more gas production assets in the South Pars field, Iran continues to
face severe gas shortages which restrict petrochemicals production.

NexantECA’s forecast shows global operating rates remaining at around 81-82% over the next
four years, with the implication that cracker operators will experience pressure on margins with the longstanding relationship between profitability and operating rates maintained. NexantECA further states that
the next cyclical peak around 2028 will be lower than normal due to the ongoing heavy capacity addition, but
notes that capacity rationalization in some areas is progressing more rapidly than expected, which may
allow for a steeper recovery in operating rates over the next five years.

The average age of many naphtha crackers in Europe and Asia is now around 40 years and these
older assets are becoming increasingly expensive to maintain in a safe and economic operating condition.
Often, the need for a major scheduled turnaround (typically every 3 to 5 years) is the point at which the


-----

viability of these aging assets is reassessed, and a pragmatic decision is taken to close them. There have
been several such closures in Europe in recent years (including the Company’s old “G4” naphtha cracker
unit at Grangemouth). Versalis closed its 490,000 tons per year cracker at Porto Marghera in early 2022.
Ethylene production in Singapore, Taiwan and Japan has come under severe pressure in 2023 as a result of
heightened competition from China, suggesting closures are likely among Asian export-focussed naphtha
cracker operators.

The new ethylene export terminal in the United States may periodically increase pressure on the
older assets. In addition, the high incidence of unplanned outages of petrochemical assets in all regions has
over the last two years been a major feature influencing the supply/demand balance of many products
(including, ethylene, polyolefins, acrylonitrile and phenol). As existing plants continue to age it will become
more difficult to forecast an aggregate improvement in industry reliability, and thus, this may be expected
to affect the actual supply/demand balance and thus the margins for the affected products. NexantECA also
notes that the cyclical nature of the industry is likely to continue, but timing is notoriously difficult to
forecast and is largely based on assumptions of an eight-year business cycle longer term.

While margins are primarily determined by the position in the cycle and relative feedstock/ product
positions, they are also susceptible to potentially significant swings in the short term. This volatility, which
may be global or isolated in individual regions, can be caused by a number of factors, including fluctuations
in utilization rates due to planned or unplanned plant outages, political and economic conditions driving
rapid changes in prices for key feedstocks, exchange rate fluctuations and changes in inventory management
policies by petrochemical customers (such as inventory building or restocking). According to NexantECA,
integrated polyolefin margins in Western Europe recovered above their long term average by mid-2022 despite
high feedstock prices. Production reliability has improved considerably after the rush to realize a longawaited recovery in profitability, restoring a lengthy supply base. European producers face increased
pressures from low cost imports, with high cost naphtha remaining the dominant feedstock even after further
penetration of imported NGLs. Abundant supplies of NGL feedstock will continue to provide a strong
cost advantage to U.S. producers despite increasing demand for new domestic crackers and export
infrastructure for NGLs and ethylene. INEOS is however uniquely placed to take advantage of these
developments due to its Dragon Class vessels which are capable of carrying both ethane and ethylene, and
its Zwijndrecht import terminal in Belgium which is capable of receiving large ocean-going vessels.
Accordingly, INEOS vessels have been observed lifting larger ethylene cargoes out of the United States
than other companies, ensuring advantaged supply for its European downstream operations.

Integrated polyolefin margins in the United States have come down from their recent record highs
as global derivative pricing has fallen along with crude oil prices, and the increasing supply surplus seeks
more distant export markets outside traditional opportunities in South America. Resin prices are set to fall
below European prices and approach the floor set in Asia. Management believes that new plant builds
are likely to be less than those expected by NexantECA and due to aging of industry assets, industry
reliability is considered unlikely to improve in the medium term. Consequently, the supply/demand balance—
the key driver of industry profitability—is likely to be better than that assumed by NexantECA.

**Chemical Intermediates**

**_Overview_**

Chemical intermediates are higher-value-added chemical products used as key components in a
wide variety of consumer and industrial products. Olefins are a key raw material and are used to produce a
wide range of products, including phenol, acetone, alpha olefins, ethylene oxide and derivatives and
nitriles.

**_Manufacturing_**

Chemical intermediates are manufactured without exception in built-for-purpose plants that utilize
technology specific to the product or products produced. Integration or close proximity to raw materials is
not absolutely essential, but we believe it offers a strategic advantage by reducing logistics costs because large
volumes of raw materials are often required. We also believe that scale is often critical to the successful
manufacture of chemical intermediates because manufacturing costs per tonne produced decrease as plant
size increases. Competition therefore tends to drive research and technology efforts toward developing
technologies which support larger plant outputs as well as higher yields. Therefore, successive generations
of plants are typically larger than previous generations and often produce higher yields.


-----

**_Feedstock_**

For most processes, feedstock costs are the most significant cost item. The costs of the feedstocks
required (such as, ethylene, propylene, and benzene) are principally driven by the price of oil and natural
gas.

Set forth below is a description of the principal chemical intermediates we provide, their applications
and their demand outlook:

    - Ethylene Oxide and Derivatives. This range includes ethylene oxide, ethylene glycol, propylene
oxide and propylene glycols.

Ethylene oxide is a highly hazardous product to transport. As a result, customers and end-use
applications tend to be co-located or closely located to ethylene oxide production facilities. This leads to a
regional market place for ethylene oxide with many opportunities for differentiation.

The most common derivative of ethylene oxide is ethylene glycol. This is very safe to transport and
is viewed as a commodity petrochemical. As such, the market place for ethylene glycol is global, with
pricing highly influenced by supply-demand balances. Ethylene glycol is primarily used in the manufacture
of polyesters and antifreeze/coolants.

Propylene oxide is also a hazardous product to transport, but is moved routinely over modest
distances. It is sold into a regional market with opportunities for differentiation. The major application of
propylene oxide is in the manufacture of polyols followed by propylene glycol, which in turn is primarily used
to produce polyesters, paints and coatings, aircraft de-icing chemicals, antifreeze and industrial coolants.
Propylene glycol is a safe product to transport and trades in a commodity market place. Other ethylene oxide
derivatives are manufactured by reacting ethylene oxide with bases, such as glycol, ammonia and other
alcohols.

Ethylene oxide demand is driven by the market requirement for ethylene oxide derivatives,
principally ethylene glycol. As a result of increased consumption of polyester, ethylene glycol has become
the second largest application for ethylene after polyethylene. Similarly, propylene oxide demand is driven by
the market requirement for propylene oxide derivatives, principally propylene glycol.

NexantECA forecasts that global demand for ethylene oxide will continue to grow steadily,
although the penetration of coal/oxalate based mono ethylene glycol production in China will curtail
growth rates below those seen historically. NexantECA estimates that 53% of Chinese mono ethylene glycol
was produced from coal in 2023, displacing conventional production from ethylene oxide.

Extremely high coal prices undermined coal-based MEG economics in 2022 and 2023, even against
the backdrop of much higher crude oil prices. Catalyst improvements enabled a major increase in MEG
production via the coal/oxalate route in 2016, notably reducing China’s import requirement for MEG by over
one million tons versus 2015. Jiutai New Material is building a new 1 million tons per year MEG plant in
China, using a new Davy syngas/methanol/formaldehyde based MEG process. The process potentially offers
a lower cost route from coal to MEG, without the restrictions of small line size which affect the economics
of the coal/oxalate process. After a period of relatively modest investment in ethylene oxide from 20102018, capacity has increased by 19 million tons per year, significantly depressing operating rates. Supply


-----

growth in North America and Asia accounts for most of the new supply, with relatively little coming from
the Middle East. New capacity and increased recycling of polyester have depressed operating rates towards a
trough of 60% in 2023, although some new project delays and higher than expected demand in China may
help avoid this. Management notes that the Company’s business is not particularly sensitive to the supply/
demand dynamics of glycol because the Company’s Oxide Business is primarily a specialties business,
adding value to ethylene oxide, and is therefore not particularly sensitive to changes in glycol supply/
demand.

     - Acrylonitrile. Acrylonitrile is a well-established commodity that has been in commercial use for
more than 70 years. It is used in the production of acrylic fiber, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene
and styrene-acrylonitrile. Acrylic fiber is used in a wide variety of consumer products, including
clothing and carpets. Acrylonitrile is manufactured from propylene, ammonia and air with the
use of a purpose-made special catalyst. Acrylonitrile is toxic, flammable and, unless chemical
stabilizers are added for storage and shipment, explosive. The building of new production plants
for acrylonitrile is particularly expensive.

Historically, acrylonitrile demand has been driven by demand for acrylic fiber. More recently,
acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and styrene-acrylonitrile polymers have taken over as the main
drivers of demand for acrylonitrile. As with other petrochemicals, the growth in demand for acrylonitrile
butadiene styrene and styrene-acrylonitrile polymers has been greatest in Asia, while demand in North
America and Europe has declined. Currently, Asia is a major net importer of acrylonitrile and derivatives,
with a significant proportion of the Asian imports coming from North America. Acrylonitrile is sometimes
viewed as a mature product, with global annual demand growth rate forecast at an average of 3.8% through
to 2028 according to NexantECA.

     - Alpha olefins. Alpha olefins include linear alpha olefins and poly alpha olefins. Linear alpha
olefins are hydrocarbons in a chain formation with physical characteristics and commercial uses
that vary according to the length of the hydrocarbon chain. Ethylene is the primary feedstock for
the production of linear alpha olefins, and linear alpha olefins, in turn, are important feedstocks
for the manufacture of certain types of polyethylene. Linear alpha olefins have many
applications in the petrochemical industry, including as surfactant intermediates, base oil for
synthetic lubricants and drilling fluids. Demand for linear alpha olefins has increased substantially
since they first became commercially available.

Poly alpha olefins, which are made by merging several linear alpha olefins together, are primarily
used as synthetic lubricants. Poly alpha olefins are value-added products as compared with linear alpha
olefins, and, accordingly, command higher margins. However, poly alpha olefins account for only
approximately 10% of the overall market for alpha olefins.

Producers of linear alpha olefins may be divided into two groups: “full-range” producers, which
manufacture the entire range of linear alpha olefins and “on purpose” or “single product” producers, which
specialize in those linear alpha olefins which historically have experienced the fastest growth. Demand for
linear alpha olefins has experienced an increasing divergence between demand for linear alpha olefins with
shorter carbon chains, which has grown more quickly, and demand for linear alpha olefins with higher carbon
chains, which on average has experienced slower growth. As a result, the industry has focused on developing
single product technologies to target the fastest growing linear alpha olefins. Demand for poly alpha
olefins is driven by the need for higher performing lubricants offering improved fuel economy, lower
emissions, improved cold start properties and longer drain intervals.

    - Phenol and acetone. Phenol and acetone are produced simultaneously from cumene in the fourstage Hock production process and are essential starting materials for a wide range of
applications in the electrical/electronics, automotive, construction and household/furniture
industries. In the production of downstream substances, neither phenol nor acetone may be
substituted. The markets for phenol and acetone are traditionally viewed as regional because of
the physical difficulty of transporting and storing phenol and the resulting high freight costs, with
regional production responding mainly to regional demand. Individual regions experience
independent cost bases, though there are limits to interregional price differentials, set by freight
costs.

NexantECA projects global phenol demand to grow on average at 3.6% per annum to 2028.
Current announced capacity additions indicate that the global industry will operate at between 80% and
84% of capacity between now and 2028. More capacity—as yet unannounced—may be added, but we believe
that this will not significantly adversely affect the supply and demand balance.


-----

**_Market Environment_**

Chemical intermediates are sometimes classified within the generic description of petrochemical
products, essentially because they, like polyolefins, tend to utilize olefins or olefins derivatives as their
primary feedstock. However, unlike polyolefins, the market place for chemical intermediate products often
involves a global customer base. There are also far fewer competitors for each product, with technology
ownership and scale of operation being key to obtaining leading market positions. Access to the whole
global market may, in some cases, not be possible when margins are insufficient to accommodate incremental
freight costs to distant regions.

The relationship between supply and demand for chemical intermediates tends to be cyclical,
although to a lesser extent than for olefins and polymers. Suppliers tend to have more ability to pass cost
increases through to their customers. Margins typically increase when demand approaches available supply.
This is primarily because product supply is driven by periods of substantial capacity additions and
followed by periods in which no or limited capacity is added.

In addition, product demand fluctuates with overall economic conditions. Market volatility for
chemical intermediates varies by product, with the wide range of applications for the different products
providing a natural hedge for demand across the range.

**Introduction**

We are one of the world’s largest chemical companies as measured by revenue. Our business has
highly integrated world class chemical facilities and production technologies. We have leading global market
positions for a majority of our key products and a strong and stable customer base. We currently operate
34 manufacturing sites in seven countries throughout the world. We are led by a highly experienced
management team with, on a combined basis, over 100 years of experience in the chemical industry. As of
September 30, 2023, our total chemical production capacity was approximately 25,000 kta, of which 57% was
in Europe and 43% was in North America.

We operate our business through three segments: Olefins & Polymers Europe, Olefins & Polymers
North America and Chemical Intermediates. The products we manufacture are derived from crude oil and
natural gas, and include olefins, polymers and various petrochemical products directly or indirectly derived
from olefins. Our products serve a broad and diverse range of end markets, including packaging,
construction, automotive, white goods/durables, agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals.

Our highly integrated, world class production facilities and technological know-how allow us to
process raw materials into higher value-added products. In Europe, we own two sites integrated with
crackers and polymer units. Typically, these two sites account for approximately 76% of our European
olefin and polymer volumes. The polyolefins plants on our two major sites in Europe normally receive more
than 95% of their feedstock supply from our integrated crackers. Following the completion of the Lavéra
Acquisition, we will also own the Naphtachimie steam cracker, which is one of Europe’s largest with a
capacity of 720 ktpa of ethylene. This cracker is integrated with the downstream derivative plants which make
up the Lavéra Businesses. Similarly, in the United States, much of our olefin feedstock requirements for
our polymer business is supplied by either our Chocolate Bayou cracker in Texas or by integrated third-party
facilities, such as the Tesoro facility in Carson, California. The Bayport Acquisition site in Bayport, Texas,
USA is also integrated with third-party facilities. We believe that with our highly integrated facilities we are
able to capture attractive margins across the value chain, enjoy greater certainty of feedstock supply,
reduce logistical costs, improve energy management and optimize our product slate.

We benefit from the cost advantages of operating large scale, well invested, highly integrated
facilities strategically located near major transportation facilities and customer locations. Since January 1,
2007, we and our predecessors have invested approximately €12 billion (including investments in divested
assets) in our production facilities to ensure that they operate efficiently, resulting in integrated, and state
of the art production units. This includes significant investments of almost €3.6 billion in the last five years
to further enhance our assets’ capabilities. We believe these investments allow us to operate at lower cost
and higher utilization rates than most of our competitors, and enable us to maintain positive margin and cash
flows even during downturns in industry cycles or customer demand. For the 12-month period ended
September 30, 2023, our revenue was €15.5 billion and our EBITDA before exceptionals was €1.6 billion.

Over the past several years, we have implemented a range of strategic initiatives designed to lower
our operating costs, increase our profitability and further enhance our market position. These include fixed
asset investments to expand our capacity in higher value products, to enhance productivity at our existing
facilities, and to reduce our fixed cost structure through headcount reductions, production line closures and
system upgrades. In addition, we have shifted our product portfolio to focus on more differentiated
products, exited low-margin businesses and implemented premium pricing strategies designed to improve
our margins. We believe these initiatives provide us with a strong platform to drive growth, create significant
operating leverage and position us to benefit from volume recovery in our end markets.

Since April 1998, when INEOS was established with the acquisition of the Belgian “Oxide” assets
from Inspec plc, we have significantly expanded, both through a series of strategic acquisitions of businesses
and assets from major chemical companies, and through organic growth. The combination of INEOS and
Innovene in December 2005 represented a transformational milestone for our company, providing global
scale and further upstream integration.

In 2011, we transferred our Refining Business, our Entrepreneurial (Refining) Business and certain
infrastructure assets to three joint ventures outside the INEOS Group. Please see “Business—Refining


-----

Divestiture, Grangemouth Divestiture and Lavéra Divestiture—The Refining Divestiture” for a further
description of the disposal of our Refining Business and Entrepreneurial (Refining) Business.

In 2013, we completed the Grangemouth Divestiture to a newly created subsidiary of INEOS
Holdings AG, our indirect parent company. See “Business—Refining Divestiture, Grangemouth Divestiture
and Lavéra Divestiture—The Grangemouth Divestiture.”

In 2014, we divested the olefins and polymers assets and Chemical Intermediates assets of the
Lavéra site. See “Business—Refining Divestiture, Grangemouth Divestiture and Lavéra Divestiture—The
Lavéra Divestiture.”

In 2015, we completed the purchase of the remaining 50% interest in the Noretyl ethylene cracker
at Rafnes, Norway from the INOVYN group (formerly the Kerling Group), a related party. In 2015, we
also acquired aromatics and cumene assets from Axiall Corporation. The acquisition comprised the world’s
largest cumene plant in Pasadena, Texas. In addition, Axiall’s phenol, acetone and alpha-methylstyrene
business was transferred to the INEOS phenol facility at Mobile, Alabama.

In 2016, the Group acquired 100% of the shares of WLP Holding Corporation, one of the largest
high density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe manufacturers in North America. Moreover, in 2016, following a
strategic review of the INEOS Technologies business, we decided to cease marketing its polyolefins licensing
technology externally and to transfer the remaining parts of the INEOS Technologies business to existing
businesses within the Group to provide a clearer focus on individual product lines.

In 2019, the Group acquired the INESCO combined heat and power plant at the Antwerp site in
Belgium.

In December 2020, the Group acquired the remaining 50% interest in the Gemini HDPE joint
venture from Sasol Chemicals. The principal activity of the company is the production of high density
polyethylene in La Porte, Texas, United States. The acquisition increased the Group’s interest in Gemini to
100% through Unrestricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the Indentures and the Senior Secured Term Loans
Agreement). Prior to the acquisition the Group reflected its 50% interest in Gemini as a joint venture. A
Restricted Subsidiary (as defined in the Indentures and the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement) of the
Group is the operator of the facility and has the exclusive right to supply Gemini with the required
components necessary for the production of a specified quantity of the HDPE products and to take such
quantity of the HDPE products and, as compensation, pays a toll fee. See “Description of Other
Indebtedness—Gemini HDPE Term Loans.”

In December 2021, the Group acquired the assets of Charter Plastics in Titusville, United States, a
manufacturer of high density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe products.

In the summer of 2022, the Group began construction of a new ethane steam cracker in Antwerp,
Belgium, for the production of ethylene with a nameplate capacity of approximately 1,450 kta, along with
associated utilities, tankage and infrastructure (“Project ONE”). We believe Project ONE is the largest
investment in the European chemicals industry for the past 20 years and we expect it to be among the most
efficient and sustainable of its kind. It is planned to be equipped with the best available technologies with
a high efficiency in use of raw materials and energy, CO2 emissions that are expected to be less than half of
the currently best performing similar units in Europe from the outset and a clear path to carbon neutrality
on a Scope 1 and Scope 2 basis within 10 years of start-up of the cracker. See also “Other Recent
Developments,” “Risk Factors—Future acquisitions or developments—Any future acquisitions or
developments may prove difficult for us to consummate,” “Risk Factors—Litigation—We are subject to
certain risks related to litigation filed by or against us, and adverse results may harm our business” and
“Business—Facilities—Project ONE.”

In December 2022, the Group acquired for approximately RMB 10.5 billion, through an
Unrestricted Subsidiary, a 50% interest in the Shanghai SECCO Petrochemical Company Limited facility
in Shanghai, China (“SECCO”). The remaining 50% is owned by Sinopec and its affiliates. SECCO has a
capacity of 4,200 kta of petrochemicals, including ethylene, propylene, polyethylene, polypropylene, styrene,
polystyrene, acrylonitrile, butadiene, benzene and toluene. In August 2023, the Group acquired, through
an Unrestricted Subsidiary, 50% interest in a joint venture with Sinopec which now holds a new petrochemical
complex in Tianjin, China currently under construction by Sinopec (the “Tianjin Nangang Ethylene
**Project”). The Tianjin Nangang Ethylene Project is expected to be on-stream in the second half of 2024**
and includes a new 500 kta HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene) plant.

On March 31, 2023, the Group completed the acquisition of the entire asset base of Mitsui
Phenols Singapore Ltd from Mitsui Chemicals for a total consideration of $273.0 million, which was
funded by cash on hand. The acquisition comprised the entire asset base of Mitsui Phenols on Jurong
Island, Singapore, which has more than 1,000 ktpa of capacity, including for cumene, phenol, acetone, alphamethylstyrene and bisphenol A. This acquisition allows us to support our global customers more effectively,
developing new markets and relationships in Asia.

In July 2023, affiliates of the Group announced their intention to acquire TotalEnergies’ 50% share
of Naphtachimie (720 ktpa steamcracker), Appryl (300 ktpa polypropylene business), Gexaro (270 ktpa
aromatics business) and 3TC (naphtha storage), currently 50:50 joint ventures between TotalEnergies and
the Lavéra Businesses. A binding sale and purchase agreement (subject to customary conditions) was signed
in October 2023.The acquisition includes other infrastructure assets associated with the site, including full
ownership of the southern sections of TotalEnergies’ ethylene pipeline network running from Lavéra to the
Lyon region. A 50% share of the central and northern sections, from the Lyon region to the Lorraine
region, will be held equally TotalEnergies and an affiliate of the Group. The Group will, immediately prior
to the acquisition of the TotalEnergies Lavéra Business, complete the Lavéra Reorganization, following which
the acquisition of the TotalEnergies Lavéra Business will occur within the Group. The Lavéra Acquisition
is subject to regulatory approval and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions and is expected to be
completed in the first half of 2024.

In December 2023, the Group agreed with LyondellBasell to acquire its Ethylene Oxide and
Derivatives business, including the Bayport Underwood site in Texas, USA for $700 million, which includes
a 420 kt Ethylene Oxide plant, a 375 kt Ethylene Glycols plant, a 165 kt Glycol Ethers plant and all
associated third-party activities on the site. The Bayport Acquisition is expected to be completed in the
second quarter of 2024, subject to regulatory and other third-party approvals and satisfaction of other
customary closing conditions.

The following table provides an overview of our capacity, global market position and leading
regional market positions with respect to our key petrochemical products.

(1) The assets of INEOS Chemicals Grangemouth Limited and INEOS Commercial Services UK Limited were transferred out of
IGH on October 1, 2013 in connection with the Grangemouth Divestiture, and the Lavéra Divestiture assets were transferred out
of IGH on July 1, 2014; therefore, their capacity has been excluded from the full-year capacity figures. However, for the estimation
of market ranking for IGH their capacities have been included since these assets remain within the broader INEOS family of
companies and there has been no restriction to, or change in, the competitive dynamic that the assets exercise within the European
market as a part of the INEOS family of companies. Therefore, in management’s view, it is helpful to consider the Grangemouth
and Lavéra assets in order to reflect the relative overall commercial strength of the INEOS family of companies, which is the
same as that of O&P Europe within IGH. Following completion of the Lavéra Acquisition, the capacity of the Lavéra Businesses
(and the TotalEnergies Lavéra Business) will form part of the IGH Group, increasing capacity of the Group by 3,770 ktpa.
(2) Following completion of the Bayport Acquisition, our capacity of ethylene oxide will increase by 420 ktpa, giving us a #2 market
position in the U.S. and improving our market position globally to #4.

_Olefins & Polymers Europe and Olefins & Polymers North America_

In our olefins and polymers businesses, we produce olefins, other cracker products, such as
butadiene and benzene, and a broad range of polyolefin polymers. We are among the largest producers of
olefins and polymers in the world. The focus of our olefins business in Europe and North America is on
ethylene and propylene, which are the two largest volume olefins globally and are key building blocks for
polymers. The olefins we make are primarily used as feedstock for our derivatives businesses. In addition, we
sell olefins to third-party customers for a variety of industrial and consumer applications, including the
manufacture of plastics, rubber and fiber. In our polymers business, we focus on polyethylene and
polypropylene.

We operate a total of 19 sites for olefins and polyolefins, including our large integrated olefins
cracker and polyolefin facilities at Köln, Germany, Rafnes, Norway, and Chocolate Bayou, Texas, United
States and nine polyethylene pipe manufacturing sites within the United States. These facilities support our
highly competitive proprietary polyolefin process technologies. The technologies include our cost-effective


-----

gas phase polypropylene technology, our specialized technology for high-density polyethylene and our
flexible proprietary “swing” technology for both linear low-density and high-density polyethylene.

The North American and European markets for olefins and polyolefins are quite distinct, with
separate pricing structures and distribution channels. As a result, each market may experience different
rates of growth and levels of return. Therefore, we operate these two businesses separately and report them
as two distinct segments—INEOS Olefins & Polymers Europe and INEOS Olefins & Polymers North
America. For the 12-month period ended September 30, 2023, our Olefins & Polymers Europe and Olefins &
Polymers North America businesses contributed €6.5 billion and €4.3 billion of revenue (excluding
intersegmental eliminations) and €338.2 million and €746.6 million of EBITDA before exceptionals,
respectively (including, in each case, intersegmental eliminations).

We are also focused on expanding our presence in Asia with the development of a number of joint
ventures with Sinopec in China (See “Business—Olefins & Polymers Asia”).

_Chemical Intermediates_

Chemical intermediates are higher-value-added chemical products used as key components in a
wide variety of consumer and industrial products. In our Chemical Intermediates business, we utilize
olefins as key raw materials and produce a wide range of products, including phenol, acetone, alpha olefins,
ethylene oxide and derivatives, acrylonitrile, ammonia and nitriles.

We have four main product groups within our Chemical Intermediates business: INEOS Nitriles,
INEOS Oligomers, INEOS Oxide and INEOS Phenol. We have a total of 17 manufacturing sites globally,
with many of our plants integrated either directly with their key raw materials on-site, or integrated via
pipeline connection.

We are the world’s leading producer of phenol, which is an essential starting material for a wide
range of applications in the electrical/electronics, automotive, construction and household/furniture
industries. Our main product in the nitriles sector is acrylonitrile, which is used in the production of acrylic
fibers and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastic. We are also among the largest volume suppliers of
linear and poly alpha olefins in the world. According to NexantECA, we are the second largest producer of
ethylene oxide in Western Europe. We have a range of associated products, including ethylene glycol,
propylene oxide, propylene glycol and acetate esters. We manufacture and supply high-quality catalysts and
additives in support of various technologies to major companies around the world, and also to our own
manufacturing assets. For the 12-month period ended September 30, 2023, our Chemical Intermediates
revenue and EBITDA before exceptionals were €7.1 billion and €540.9 million, respectively, excluding
intersegmental eliminations.

**Our Competitive Strengths**

We believe that the factors set forth below provide us with a competitive advantage in the markets
in which we compete:

    - Diversified Portfolio of Businesses Serving a Broad Range of End Markets. We are one of the
world’s largest chemical companies. We operate 34 manufacturing sites in seven countries around
the world. These assets have a total production capacity of approximately 25,000 kta as of
September 30, 2023. We believe we have a top 5 or better global or regional market position in
12 of our key products.

Our petrochemical products are utilized in a wide range of end-market applications. The
following diagram sets forth our petrochemicals revenue by end use application in 2022.

We believe that such application and market diversity reduces the effect of industry cyclicality on
our results. In addition, we believe that we benefit from the fact that the supply and demand
dynamics of the cycles relating to our petrochemical products are fairly independent, which helps
mitigate some of the cyclicality in the industry.

- Vertically Integrated, World-Scale Producer. We have three large-scale petrochemical sites,
accounting for approximately 39% of our total petrochemical production capacity as of
September 30, 2023. Each of these sites is integrated with a major cracker and/or polymers and
derivatives unit.

We operate one of the largest single-site ethylene oxide/ethylene glycol plants in Europe and the
two largest phenol plants in Europe, one of which is the largest in the world, as well as the largest
single train phenol plant in North America. We operate the largest acrylonitrile facility in the
world and one of the largest high-density polyethylene complexes in North America. We believe
that our existing plants have sufficient capacity such that as our production volumes increase, we
will be able to leverage our fixed cost base and increase our profitability.


-----

Our sites are typically located near raw materials, refineries and associated pipeline infrastructure.
We believe our highly integrated facilities provide us with the ability to capture margins across
the value chain, enjoy certainty of feedstock supply (particularly for ethylene), reduce logistical
costs, improve energy management, adjust the product slate to capture greater value (by selling
olefins or, alternatively, by using them internally in the production of polymers or derivatives)
and reduce our exposure to margin volatility as a result of changes in raw material prices. We
operate large plants that permit us to spread fixed costs over large volumes of production, thereby
reducing unit costs and enhancing profits.

- Access to Advantaged Feedstocks. Our Chocolate Bayou cracker installation in the United
States uses natural gas liquids-based feedstocks, such as ethane, as its main feedstocks. This allows
us to benefit from the current low-cost supply of ethane resulting from the growth in the supply
of shale gas in the United States. Ethane is also a lower-cost feedstock than naphtha in Europe,
where we operate a very efficient gas olefin cracker in Rafnes. In 2019, our butane storage tank
contract was signed to provide the largest ever built in Europe. The tank came on stream in the
Port of Antwerp, Belgium in October 2020. Our other olefin cracker in Europe, at Köln, is a
naphtha cracker, but it has significant gas cracking flexibility. Our ability to use lower-cost
feedstocks, like ethane and butane, gives us an advantage over our competitors with crackers that
cannot accept such a significant mix of gas feedstocks, and must rely on more expensive
naphtha. The gas cracking flexibility has been enhanced further with expanded butane supply to
our cracker in Köln supported by four Rhine river barges. Contracts for supply of four Rhine
river barges were signed in 2018 with delivery of three in 2020 and the fourth delivery in 2021. In
the summer of 2022, we began construction of Project ONE, a new ethane steam cracker in
Antwerp, Belgium for the production of ethylene. We believe it is the largest investment in the
European chemicals industry for the past 20 years and we expect it to be among the most efficient
and sustainable of its kind.

In addition, our Chocolate Bayou cracker and our naphtha crackers in Europe can also use
naphtha as a feedstock, allowing us to manage our feedstock mix in response to changes in
economic and market conditions and maximize our margins. Our fleet of eight long-term chartered
Dragon class ships and four VLEC vessels, together with the expanded gas storage terminal in
Rafnes, a deep water terminal near Philadelphia and long-term supply contracts, provides us
access to the attractive U.S. ethane market for our gas-based cracker in Rafnes, Norway.

- Well-Invested, Highly Efficient Production Facilities. Our large, well-invested plants benefit
from economies of scale and favorable locations. Our acquisition activity has focused on acquiring
businesses that complement our existing manufacturing facilities with well-invested physical
assets from major chemical companies. In addition, each year we continue to invest in improving
and expanding our facilities. Since January 1, 2007, we and our predecessors have invested
approximately €12 billion (including investments in divested assets) in our production facilities
to ensure that they operate efficiently, resulting in integrated, and state-of-the-art production units.
This includes significant investments of almost €3.6 billion in the last five years to further
enhance our assets’ capabilities.

- Extensive Portfolio of Leading Proprietary Technologies. We have a broad portfolio of
proprietary manufacturing technologies which we use for the manufacturing of our key products.
We believe that they enable us to be one of the lowest cost producers and provide us with a
significant competitive advantage in terms of product quality, and we continue to improve the
portfolio through focused research and technology investments.

- Experienced Management Team with a Strong Track Record. Our senior management team has
been operating INEOS and our predecessors for over 20 years and has a demonstrated track
record of achieving profitable growth in the chemical industry, successfully integrating large
acquisitions, dramatically reducing the fixed cost base, and deleveraging the business following
such acquisitions. James A. Ratcliffe, our controlling shareholder, and the other existing
shareholders have a successful record of investing in the chemical industry. Across the wider
INEOS group, including our ultimate parent company and its other subsidiaries, we have
completed 42 significant acquisitions since the formation of INEOS in 1998. Each of these
acquisitions has been integrated effectively and we have been able to achieve significant costsavings in the acquired businesses. Our management team has extensive experience in the chemical
industry, including working for leading companies such as ICI, DuPont, Dow, Degussa and BP,


-----

and a proven ability to increase productivity, reduce costs and control capital expenditures and
working capital. We believe the experience of our management team is a distinct competitive
advantage.

In addition, our senior management team has demonstrated the ability to streamline our
businesses by focusing on core competencies and disposing of non-core or underperforming
businesses. In the past 12 years, we have disposed of several non-core or underperforming
businesses. We disposed of the Refining Business and the Entrepreneurial (Refining) Business in
July 2011. On October 1, 2013, we completed the Grangemouth Divestiture to a newly created
subsidiary of INEOS Holdings AG, our indirect parent company. See “Business—Refining
Divestiture, Grangemouth Divestiture and Lavéra Divestiture—The Grangemouth Divestiture.”
The disposal of these businesses has enabled us to focus management time on core activities,
reduce our capital expenditure requirements going forward and also reduce our exposure to
underperforming cash consuming businesses. On July 1, 2014, the Group also completed the
Lavéra Divestiture to a new subsidiary of INEOS AG, the ultimate parent company of the Group
at the time of the divestiture. See “Business—Refining Divestiture, Grangemouth Divestiture
and Lavéra Divestiture—The Lavéra Divestiture.” The Lavéra Acquisition will bring the Lavéra
Businesses back into the Group, now with full ownership and control and without the limitations
of a joint venture, which we believe will allow us to unlock greater value in the assets.

**Our Business Strategy**

In response to challenges resulting from the current macroeconomic environment and as part of
our long-term strategic aim, we have maintained and will continue to execute a strategy consisting of the
following short- and long-term elements. These are designed to help us improve our capital structure, leverage
our key strengths and market opportunities and ensure ongoing cash flow generation and growth:

    - Where and When Appropriate, and within the Confines of Our Capital Structure, to Pursue
**_Long-term Value-added Growth Opportunities._** As a result of our lean corporate structure, we
are able to maintain a level of agility that few organizations our size are able to match. We have a
highly disciplined evaluation process and a detailed series of metrics by which we measure the
value creation prospects of potential projects. Opportunities for profitable growth are identified
and vetted in an efficient, non-bureaucratic format, which, in many cases, we believe enables us to
establish a first-mover advantage. For example, we continued to pursue opportunities to grow
our assets in the U.S. through the expansion of our Chocolate Bayou cracker in 2020, and, also
in 2020, acquired the remaining 50% of the high-density polyethylene plant at our Battleground
site in Texas from Sasol Limited. Our O&P Europe business also has in place 15-year supply
and infrastructure agreements entered into in 2012 to access ethane feedstock from the United
States for use in its European cracker complexes. In 2020, we opened a new 420 kta linear alpha
olefins plant and, in 2022, we opened a new 120 kta poly alpha olefins plant, both at Chocolate
Bayou, Texas. In the summer of 2022, we began construction of our 1,450 kta ethane steam
cracker for the production of ethylene in Antwerp, Belgium. In addition, we are currently pursuing
several other projects that we believe provide opportunities for profitable growth. We are
particularly focused on expanding our footprint in Asia to further access the high demand
growth of that region, which may take the form of joint ventures and Unrestricted Subsidiaries.
For example, in 2022, we acquired a 50% interest in the SECCO facility in China and, in 2023, we
acquired a 50% stake in the Tianjin Nangang Ethylene Project, currently under construction by
Sinopec, which is expected to be on-stream in the second half of 2024 and includes a new 500 kta
HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene) plant, in each case through an Unrestricted Subsidiary. On
March 31, 2023, the Group completed the acquisition of the entire asset base of Mitsui Phenols
Singapore Ltd from Mitsui Chemicals for a total consideration of $273.0 million, which was
funded by cash on hand. The acquisition comprised the entire asset base of Mitsui Phenols on
Jurong Island, Singapore, which has more than 1,000 ktpa of capacity, including for cumene,
phenol, acetone, alpha-methylstyrene and bisphenol A. This acquisition provides us with additional
capacity to support our global customers more effectively, developing new markets and
relationships in Asia. In 2023, we agreed with LyondellBasell to acquire its Ethylene Oxide and
Derivatives business, including the Bayport Underwood site in Texas, USA, which includes a
420 kt Ethylene Oxide plant, a 375 kt Ethylene Glycols plant, a 165 kt Glycol Ethers plant,
and associated third-party activities on the site (expected to be completed in the second quarter
of 2024). The acquisition will expand our Ethylene Oxide & Derivatives business into the US,
which is the world’s largest market, with what we believe are well-run and best-in-class assets. It


-----

also complements our existing Ethanolamines production facility in Plaquemine, Louisiana. In
addition, there is free land on the Bayport Underwood site for INEOS’ growth aspirations and it
is an ideal location to develop our third-party business supporting customers to co-locate and
integrate into an existing Ethylene Oxide & Derivatives platform. In July 2023, affiliates of the
Group announced their intention to acquire TotalEnergies’ 50% share of Naphtachimie (720 ktpa
steamcracker), Appryl (300 ktpa polypropylene business), Gexaro (270 ktpa aromatics business)
and 3TC (naphtha storage), currently 50:50 joint ventures between TotalEnergies and the
Lavéra Businesses. The acquisition includes other infrastructure assets associated with the site,
including full ownership of the southern sections of TotalEnergies’ ethylene pipeline network
running from Lavéra to the Lyon region. The Group will, immediately prior to the acquisition of
the TotalEnergies Lavéra Business, complete the Lavéra Reorganization, following which the
TotalEnergies Lavéra Business will occur within the Group. The Lavéra Acquisition is subject to
regulatory approval and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions and is expected to
be completed in the first half of 2024. The Lavéra Acquisition will allow us to fully integrate the
Lavéra assets and enhance the competitiveness of our offer, and gives us direct access to the
complete ethylene production from the Naphtachimie cracker for the Group’s internal use and
third party customers.

- Continue to Drive Sustainability as a Fundamental Part of Our Business. We believe we are a
leader in driving sustainable practices across our industry as evidenced by our 2023 Sustainalytics
rating which placed us as 11th best (11th lowest risk) of 576 chemical companies so far assessed,
and 4th best out of 273 commodity chemical companies. Our sustainability strategy is to
develop and safely manufacture the products needed to address the evolving challenges of climate
change, public health, resource scarcity, urbanization and waste in a way which drives us all
towards a Net Zero Emission Economy by 2050 while remaining profitable. We believe our Health,
Safety, Security and Environmental (“HSSE”) performance is industry leading. Our strategy is
to continue to improve injury incidence metrics and environmental compliance ratings by applying
increasingly sophisticated methodologies, with the ultimate aim being to achieve zero accidents.
We seek to ensure that all employees receive appropriate training, thereby enabling them to
effectively contribute to HSSE performance and HSSE improvement processes. It is our policy
to design our processes and manufacture and distribute our products in a responsible manner so
that our employees, customers, the public and the environment are protected to the extent
practicable from avoidable risks. Our businesses have put in place roadmaps to lead the transition
to a Net Zero Economy in our industry by no later than 2050, while remaining profitable, and
staying ahead of evolving regulations and legislation. Based on these roadmaps, we are setting
ambitious but achievable targets for 2030 which are in line with our 2050 commitment. Our target
is to reduce greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions by 33% (as compared to 2019) on a like-for-like
basis by no later than 2030. This target is consistent with EU and other national GHG emissions
reduction targets. In the near term, we are investing over €6 billion on projects which will
reduce our emissions footprint. We are also investing in new products and technologies to drive
the industry to a circular economy in which materials are re-used to the maximum extent, and no
products, once used, enter the natural environment. For example, we have committed to make
all our products recyclable and, by 2025, to develop a range of polyolefin products containing at
least 50% recycled product. Overall, across wider INEOS (including entities outside of the
Group), we have committed to achieving 850 kt of recycled or bio content in our polymers by
2030, which is consistent with anticipated regulatory recycled-content targets in Europe.

- Generate Cost Savings and Enhance Efficiency. We have historically succeeded in reducing costs
at our acquired businesses by making rapid reductions in underlying fixed costs and implementing
an efficient corporate and management structure. We have achieved significant fixed cost
reductions in businesses that we have acquired, delivering on average a reduction of 20% of
inherited fixed costs in the four-year period post acquisition. Continuous improvements in the
efficiency of our existing sites and opportunities for site consolidation are key aspects of this
strategy, as we seek to maintain upper quartile cost positions and world-scale facilities across the
majority of our operations. The control of fixed costs will continue to be a key priority for our
business.

- Generate Strong Cash Flow. We intend to continue our focus on cash flow generation by
maximizing the utilization of assets, leveraging existing resources, continuously improving
working capital practices, following disciplined and focused capital expenditure and cost reduction
plans and optimizing where possible our capital structure. This focus has allowed us to reduce
our costs and improve our cash flow management, such as the ability to implement lower levels


-----

of maintenance capital expenditure. We apply the cash flows generated from these initiatives to
help reduce our debt and to strategically invest in the business.

    - Maximize Utilization of Assets. As a low-cost focused producer, we believe in operating our
facilities at full capacity. We believe this allows us to maintain positive margins and cash flows,
even during downturns in industry cycles or customer demand, more readily than some of our
competitors who have higher production costs. We intend to achieve growth in production volume
by improving utilization rates within the defined availability of an asset, improving availability
of an asset by minimizing planned and unplanned facility downtime and improving capacity of an
asset through de-bottlenecking projects. We have a strong track record of improving utilization
rates of acquired assets.

    - Maintain a Lean Corporate Structure and Incentivize Employees. We intend to operate our
business in a manner that is consistent with the philosophy of our shareholders and maintain a
simple and decentralized, flat organizational structure that minimizes corporate bureaucracy,
coupled with compensation arrangements that incentivize our employees. We believe that a
simple and decentralized organizational structure is cost-effective and will allow each of our
management teams the freedom to use their industry knowledge to respond to market
opportunities. We believe that we can increase the value of our business when our employees
share in the value they create. We have management and employee bonuses and long-term
incentive plans linked to the EBITDA before exceptionals performance and other factors of the
business in which they work.

    - Maximize Flexibility to Use Advantaged Feedstocks. We remain focused on our strategy of
acquiring advantaged feedstock sources and improving our flexibility to use different feedstocks
to take advantage of changing market conditions. In 2017, we entered into an agreement to
construct one of the largest butane tanks in Europe. In 2019, our butane storage tank contract
was signed to provide the largest ever built in Europe. The tank came on stream in the Port of
Antwerp, Belgium in October 2020 and allows us to import butane from the United States (and
from all over the world) to supply material to our naphtha crackers at Köln. This project
complements our contracts signed in 2012 and 2015 to source ethane directly from the United
States for our Rafnes cracker as well as our a new ethane import tank and new ethane furnace at
our Norwegian plant. The gas cracking flexibility has been enhanced further with expanded
butane supply to our cracker in Köln supported by four Rhine river barges, which were delivered
in 2020 and 2021. We are also committed to maintaining flexibility in feedstock while expanding
our olefins capacity. For example, our Chocolate Bayou plant predominantly uses liquid based
natural gas as feedstock, but has the ability to process naphtha and our Köln plant is capable
of switching between naphtha and butane as a feedstock. This enables us to manage our feedstock
mix in line with changing market and economic conditions. To further enhance our sourcing of
advantaged feedstock, we began construction of a new ethane steam cracker in Antwerp, Belgium,
referred to as Project ONE, for the production of ethylene in the summer of 2022. We believe it
is the largest investment in the European chemicals industry for the past 20 years and we expect it
to be among the most efficient and sustainable of its kind.

(1) In Europe, we consume more ethylene than we produce, which allows us to operate our crackers in Europe at higher operating
rates than the industry average. In North America, the olefin crackers at our Chocolate Bayou facility manufacture substantially
more ethylene than is required by our polymers and derivatives units in the Gulf Coast region. As a result, we sell substantial
amounts of the ethylene that we produce to customers in the Gulf Coast region of the United States.

(2) In Europe and North America, we consume more propylene than we produce. Our propylene consumption is primarily related to
the production of polypropylene, propylene oxide, oxo alcohols, phenol and acrylonitrile.

(3) According to NexantECA, measured by average annual capacity, we are the second largest manufacturer of high density
polyethylene in Western Europe and the third largest manufacturer of linear low density polyethylene in Europe.

(4) The assets of INEOS Chemicals Grangemouth Limited and INEOS Commercial Services UK Limited were transferred out of
IGH on October 1, 2013 in connection with the Grangemouth Divestiture, and the Lavéra Divesture assets were transferred out
of IGH on July 1, 2014. However for the estimation of market ranking for IGH their capacities have been included since these assets
remain within the broader INEOS family of companies and there has been no restriction to, or change in, the competitive
dynamic that the assets exercise within the European market as a part of the INEOS family of companies. Therefore in
management’s view, it is helpful to consider the Grangemouth and Lavéra assets in order to reflect the relative overall commercial
strength of the INEOS family of companies, which is the same as that of O&P Europe within IGH. Following completion of
the Lavéra Acquisition, the capacity of the Lavéra Businesses (as well as TotalEnergies’ 50% interest in certain of those plants)
will form part of the IGH Group, increasing capacity of the Group by 3,770 ktpa.

Set forth below is a description of the principal petrochemical products and their applications.

_Olefins and related products:_

    - Ethylene. According to NexantECA, ethylene is the world’s most widely used petrochemical in
terms of volume, accounting for over one-third of the global production of primary
petrochemicals. It is the key building block used to produce a large number of higher value
added chemicals, including polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride via ethylene dichloride and styrene
via ethylbenzene. Ethylene is a flammable gas and is a primary olefin obtained in a cracking
process, as described above. Because ethylene is a gas, it must be transported either by pipeline
or in the form of a highly pressurized and refrigerated liquid, which is expensive.

While ethylene itself has no consumer applications, demand for ethylene is driven essentially by its
use as feedstock for various thermoplastics, which are plastics that soften when heated and harden again
when cooled, including polyethylene and other polymer derivatives. Aside from being the feedstock for
polyethylene production, demand for ethylene is also driven by the manufacture of ethylene oxide and
derivatives, ethylene dichloride and ethyl benzene. According to NexantECA, the global market for ethylene
is forecast to grow at 3.4% per annum through 2028 versus forecast GDP growth of 3.2% during the same
period, driven by polyethylene applications such as high-density polyethylene and linear low-density
polyethylene.


-----

    - Propylene. Propylene is a flammable gas which is derived as a co-product either of the refinery
fluid catalytic cracker process used to make gasoline or of the steam cracking process used to
make ethylene. More recently, propylene is also being produced from processes such as propane
dehydrogenation and metathesis. Propylene is an important feedstock for a significant number of
industrial products and is the main feedstock for polypropylene and acrylonitrile. Propylene is
marginally easier to transport than ethylene and may be shipped by pipeline, road, rail or ship.

Global propylene demand is driven essentially by its use as feedstock for various thermoplastics
and by the level of demand for propylene derivatives, particularly polypropylene, propylene oxide,
acrylonitrile, oxo-alcohols, cumene and acrylic acid. Growth in the demand for polypropylene has stemmed
from the substitution of non-polymers (paper, wood, glass and metal, etc.) due to its relative cost advantage
and superior performance. According to NexantECA, the global market for propylene is projected to grow at
4.2% per annum through 2028, driven mainly by polypropylene demand.

    - Butadiene. Butadiene is a gas and is one of the co-products of the steam cracking process used
to manufacture ethylene and propylene. Butadiene is used primarily in the production of
polymers, principally synthetic rubbers such as styrene-butadiene rubber, which is used to make
tires and other rubber products. Other polymers made from butadiene include acrylonitrilebutadiene styrene and styrene-butadiene latex. Butadiene is also used to make ethylidene
norbornene monomer.

Butadiene demand is driven primarily by growth in consumption of synthetic rubber. According to
NexantECA, the global market for butadiene is projected to grow at an average of 3% per annum through
2028. Demand is tightly linked to the market for synthetic rubber, which is, in turn, mainly consumed in the
automotive sector.

    - Benzene. Benzene is used to produce a number of petrochemical intermediates, such as styrene,
cumene for phenol and acetone, cyclohexane and nitrobenzene. It is mainly produced from
refinery processes or as a co-product of steam cracker operations.

Styrene is the largest chemical outlet for benzene at around 48% of demand. The second largest
outlet for benzene, accounting for 20% of demand, is cumene, which is nearly all consumed in phenol
production with acetone formed as a co-product. For 2022, NexantECA estimated the global benzene
demand to be 53.9 million tons, with 68% being consumed in the production of ethylbenzene for the styrenics
industry and cumene for the phenolics industry. NexantECA forecasts an average global growth rate in
demand of approximately 3.3% per year in the 2023-2028 period.

    - Polyethylene. Polyethylene is the world’s most widely used thermoplastic and is made by the
polymerization of ethylene. Polyethylene is often classified by its density, because greater density
corresponds with greater material rigidity.

Film is the largest single use of global polyethylene production and the primary driver of demand,
representing approximately one half of worldwide polyethylene consumption. Film includes a myriad of
end use applications, from food packaging to trash bags, stretch films and shrink films. Blow molding and
injection molding are the next largest uses and are also important demand drivers. In the blow molded
category, blow molded bottles are the single largest end use. NexantECA forecasts an average global
growth rate in demand of approximately 3.7% per year in the 2023-2028 period.

    - Polypropylene. Polypropylene is the world’s second most widely used thermoplastic after
polyethylene and is among the fastest growing categories of thermoplastics. It is manufactured
by the polymerization of propylene. The rapid growth of polypropylene-based products reflects
the superior cost and performance characteristics of this material. As one of the industry’s most
versatile polymers, polypropylene is achieving a portion of its growth by displacing other
polymers, such as polyethylene and polystyrene.

According to NexantECA, the global polypropylene market is projected to grow at 4.2% per
annum through 2028. NexantECA expects that the demand for polypropylene in Asia will continue to grow
at higher rates than North America and Europe, primarily as a result of growth in the Chinese market.

**_Manufacturing_**

Olefins are produced primarily by the steam cracking of hydrocarbon feedstocks. In steam
cracking, a gaseous or liquid hydrocarbon feed, such as naphtha, liquefied petroleum gas or ethane, is
diluted with steam and briefly heated in a furnace without the presence of oxygen. Typically, the reaction


-----

temperature is very high, at around 850°C, but the reaction is only allowed to take place very briefly. In
modern cracking furnaces, the reaction time is further reduced to milliseconds, resulting in gas velocities
faster than the speed of sound, to improve yield. After the cracking temperature has been reached, the gas
is quickly quenched to stop the reaction in a transfer line heat exchanger. The products produced in the
reaction depend on the composition of the feed, the hydrocarbon-to-steam ratio and on the cracking
temperature and furnace residence time.

Light hydrocarbon feeds, such as ethane, liquefied petroleum gas or light naphtha, yield product
streams rich in the lighter alkenes, including ethylene, propylene and butadiene. Heavier hydrocarbon feeds
(full-range and heavy naphthas, as well as other refinery products) yield some of these products too, but also
yield products rich in aromatic hydrocarbons and hydrocarbons suitable for inclusion in gasoline or fuel
oil. Higher cracking temperatures (also referred to as higher levels of “severity”) favor the production of
ethylene and benzene, whereas lower cracking temperatures (lower levels of “severity”) produce higher
amounts of propylene, C4-hydrocarbons and liquid products.

Depending on feedstock, varying levels of ethylene, propylene and other by-products are achieved.
Ethane produces the most ethylene but the least propylene. Naphtha produces substantially less ethylene,
roughly one-third of that of ethane, but produces more propylene and significantly more by-products.

The main polyolefins are the thermoplastics, polyethylene and polypropylene, which are produced
by the polymerization of the olefin monomers ethylene and propylene, respectively. While the majority of
polyethylene and polypropylene are homopolymers (a combination of the same monomers), a growing
proportion is copolymers (polymers that are produced from a combination of two or more monomers).

Polyolefins are produced using a number of different technologies that are widely available,
including one high-pressure process and three low-pressure processes (Solution, Slurry and Gas Phase). All
of the technologies are constantly being adapted to improve product qualities and reduce production
costs. For commodity products, produced on modern scale technology, the cost structure of these technologies
is similar. Increased cost structures for producing specialty products are typically justified by premium
margins.

The following is a summary of the four processes:

**_High-Pressure Process_**

This was the original process used to produce polyethylene and is still in use today. This process is
a free radical polymerization that does not require the use of a catalyst, operating at pressures above 1,000
and up to 3,500 bar and temperatures from 150° to 340°C. Originally conducted in a high-pressure autoclave,
current processes more commonly use a tubular reactor. This process is used to produce low-density
polyethylene, characterized by long-chain branching, considerable flexibility and clarity. Because of the highpressures involved, this process involves higher risk than low-pressure processes and requires expensive
and specialized equipment; consequently, fewer high-pressure processes have been constructed in recent years.

**_Low-Pressure Processes_**

These processes typically operate below 200 bar and have lower capital intensity but require the aid
of a catalyst. In addition, it is common to add a comonomer (butene or hexene in the case of polyethylene,
and ethylene in the case of polypropylene) to tailor the resultant polymer properties.

    - Solution Process. This process operates at temperatures above the melting point of the
polyolefin (above 130°C for polyethylene and above 140°C for polypropylene) and employs
metallocene or Ziegler-Natta catalysts and a solvent to dissolve the growing polymer chains. This
process is best suited to make high-density polyethylene (having very few chain branches, and
those branches that do exist are short—only a few carbon atoms in length) and linear lowdensity polyethylene (having many short-chain branches, which may be contrasted to low-density
polyethylene with many long-chain branches). Solution processes have the ability to produce
narrow molecular weight distribution polyolefins.

    - Slurry (or Suspension) Process. This process is a continuous low temperature (60° – 105°C,
20 – 35 bar for polyethylene or 60° – 85°C, 35 – 50 bar for polypropylene) process in which
polymer forms as a solid particle in the presence of a catalyst while suspended in a liquid slurry.
In the case of polyethylene, the polymerization takes place in an inert liquid carrier such as
isobutane. In the case of polypropylene, the polymerization takes place in liquid hexane, heptane,
or even liquid propylene monomer. When propylene is utilized as the carrier liquid, the process


-----

is often referred to as “bulk slurry.” The carrier liquid serves to aid in the removal of heat as it
carries the growing polymer particles through the reaction process. The catalyst may be chromium
on silica (polyethylene only), Ziegler-Natta, or metallocene. The reactor may be a stirred tank
or a pipe-loop reactor, in either case jacketed to aid in removal of the heat of reaction. One or more
reactors may be placed in series to broaden the molecular weight distribution and produce
bimodal polyolefins. This process is best suited to making high-density polyethylene and
homopolymer polypropylene. One advantage of this process over other high-density polyethylene
processes is the ability to make rapid grade transitions, which makes it particularly well suited
to the manufacture of specialty polyethylene products.

    - Gas Phase. As the name implies, polymerization occurs with the solid polymer particles
produced on a heterogeneous catalyst in the gas phase. Like the slurry process, the catalyst may
be chromium on silica (polyethylene only), Ziegler-Natta, or metallocene. In the reactor, the
growing polyolefin particles are fluidized and cooled by the gaseous reactants and/or nitrogen,
or sub-fluidized and mechanically agitated. Liquid monomer may be added and flashed to aid in
the removal of heat. The reaction takes place at low temperature (80° – 100°C for polyethylene
and about 60° – 85°C for polypropylene) and pressure (15 – 35 bar). A gas phase process has
advantages over slurry and solution processes in that the heat of reaction is very effectively removed
and operates with lower hydrocarbon inventories. In addition, high-ethylene content copolymers
of polypropylene can be produced in this process. This process is best suited to the manufacture
of linear low-density polyethylene, high-density polyethylene and all types of polypropylene,
including homopolymer, random copolymer, impact copolymer and soft thermoplastic polyolefin.

Post polymerization, any catalyst is deactivated, the polyolefin is freed of any solvent, unreacted
monomer or liquid diluent, and the resulting polyolefin flake or crumb is combined with additives and
extruded into pellets prior to sale to downstream fabricators.

Several of these technologies have recently been adapted to run multiple reactions in series,
yielding a product with a wider bi-modal molecular weight distribution that provides superior strength or
unique characteristics such as high-impact resistance.

**_Research and Intellectual Property_**

Our olefins and polymers businesses are supported by technology centers in Houston (United
States), Brussels (Belgium), Rosignano (Italy) and Lavéra (France), which in turn support the following
highly proprietary process technologies that we believe together form one of the most competitive technology
platforms available in the olefins and polymers industry.

    - Gas phase polypropylene technology. Our gas phase polypropylene technology enables the
cost-effective production of high-performance polypropylene plastics.

    - High-density polyethylene technology. We own specialized technology for the manufacture of
high-density polyethylene that is characterized by low capital investments and low operating costs
and is particularly well-adapted to the manufacture of high-performance materials such as highpressure pipe, one of the fastest growing segments of the high-density polyethylene market.

    - Gas phase polyethylene technology. This technology is designed to serve the linear low-density
polyethylene and high-density polyethylene markets, which are the fastest growing segments of the
commodity polyethylene markets. The technology is characterized by low capital investment,
low operating cost, low emissions and waste, and no requirement for the use of additional solvents.

Historically, the Group has sold over 75 licenses to third parties across the three technologies.
However, the Group no longer sells licenses, and instead focuses on development of advantaged products
for the Group’s different polymers businesses.

We continue to manufacture and sell polyolefin catalysts to third parties. Management believes that
the polyolefin catalyst business is complementary to the polyolefins business, and does not adversely affect
INEOS’s competitive position in its polyolefin markets. The catalyst business is managed within the Olefins
and Polymers business in Europe and has grown significantly over the last four years.

**_Transportation_**

We have access to a comprehensive transportation network and associated logistics infrastructure
through a combination of ownership and long-term contracts. We believe that this network enables us to


-----

move feedstocks and products at competitive rates and provides us with access to the merchant market,
enabling us to manage demand and supply imbalances across the petrochemical value chain in response to
market conditions.

Because pipelines are the most efficient and least expensive mode of transportation, we consider
them to be of strategic importance. We own some of the pipelines we use, while others are consortiumowned pipelines in which we hold a stake or are provided to us by dedicated operators under long-term
contracts. Other pipelines in Europe may be accessed without a contract as long as the appropriate tariff is
paid.

Where we are reliant on access to shipping channels, we either own or hold stakes in the relevant
terminals and storage facilities or have secured access to them through long-term contracts. We own several
dedicated barges and also utilize an extensive network of third- party shipping companies which make
capacity available to us on a spot- or term-contract basis that is managed by our own in-house Marine
Assurance Service.

**_Competition_**

We face intense competition in the olefins and polymers markets in which we compete. Given that
most of the products are commodities, the main competitive criterion is price. In certain segments of the
polyethylene and polypropylene markets, where products must satisfy specified technical performance criteria,
competition is also based on performance, quality and customer service. A key competitive factor is the
ability to manage costs successfully, which requires management focus on reducing unit costs and improving
efficiency. The main drivers in this respect include technology, scale, feedstock access, asset utilization,
logistics and the ability to execute capital projects efficiently.

Because polymers are easily transported in bulk shipping containers or rail cars, there is significant
trade between regions. Globally we compete against a large number of polymer companies, many of which
have capacity in multiple regions and who market their products in Europe, Asia and North America. Our
competitors include LyondellBasell, Sabic, Dow and ExxonMobil.

Information—Use of Non-IFRS Financial Measures.”

**_Products_**

In our olefins business, we manufacture ethylene, propylene, butadiene, raffinate 1, benzene,
toluene and gasoline blending components. The majority of our ethylene and propylene is either used for
polyolefins production or sold to other INEOS businesses as feedstock. Our butadiene, raffinate 1, benzene,
toluene and gasoline blending components are sold to other INEOS businesses as well as other producers
of synthetic rubber, ABS plastics, oligomers, cumene, styrene and polyurethanes and are traded on the open
markets. Olefins & Polymers Europe is one of the largest olefin and polyolefin producers in Europe.

In our polymers business we manufacture High Density Polyethylene (HDPE), Low-Density
Polyethylene (LDPE), Linear Low-Density Polyethylene (LLDPE) and Polypropylene (PP).


-----

In HDPE we are active in car fuel tank, milk bottle, high performance pipe and blow molding
applications, most of which require lengthy customer approval processes. Sales from our HDPE asset have
grown significantly since 2013.

Our low-density polyethylene products are particularly well-suited to specialty applications in the
wire and cable, medical and coatings sectors which also require lengthy customer approval processes. Our
coating customers form the backbone of our LDPE business and we also have a significant volume of medical
product sales and other specialty grades which generate high margins.

Our linear low-density polyethylene production is primarily sold to customers in the film sector,
and, thanks to the use of our proprietary metallocene technology, we have sales of both commodity and
specialty grades into film applications like super-tough and sealable films.

In polypropylene our focus has been in high modulus pipe and related applications, highly
reinforced impact copolymers for injection molding, medical and heat sealable BOPP films, where we have a
strong global position in sealant material.

**_Manufacturing_**

Olefins & Polymers Europe operates large integrated olefins cracker and polymer sites with a total
capacity of 5,050 kta for the production of ethylene, propylene, butadiene, benzene, polyethylene and
polypropylene. We own and operate a large naphtha cracker complex in Köln, Germany, and a large gas
cracker in Rafnes, Norway. Until the end of 2015, the gas cracker at Rafnes, received all of its feedstock from
gas sources in the North Sea but from 2016 the majority of Rafnes feedstock is ethane sourced from U.S.
shale gas fields. The naphtha cracker complex at Köln includes two naphtha crackers and a small integrated
ethane cracker which consumes ethane produced by the naphtha crackers. The naphtha crackers are also
able to consume butane as part of their feed-slate and this flexibility enables the management of feedstock
mix in response to changes in economic and market conditions, resulting in the maximization of margins.
Both of these cracker sites are either co-located with, or connected by pipeline to, polyolefin plants and to
other olefin-derivative units, with market leading economies of scale and operational optionality that permits
us to maximize our margins across a broad portfolio of olefin-derivatives.

The cracker complex in Köln, Germany, benefits from being located in the center of one of the key
industrial clusters of Germany, while also being able to access feedstocks by pipeline and barge from the
Antwerp and Rotterdam area in the Netherlands; one of the world’s most competitive naphtha supply
regions. It is the third largest cracker complex in Europe, and the largest in Germany. With a proven track
record of operational excellence, this very reliable asset benefits from considerable downstream integration
with a wide portfolio of olefin derivatives on- and off-site, including polyethylene, ethylene oxide, nitriles,
oligomers, ABS engineering plastic and synthetic rubber. It can also sell its excess ethylene and propylene to
the merchant market via pipelines and the site can also sell propylene by barge using its own jetties on the
river Rhine and by rail. In particular, the Köln site is connected to Europe’s largest ethylene pipeline network
owned by ARG, a company jointly owned by INEOS and four other European petrochemical companies.

The Noretyl gas cracker in Rafnes has been modernized and expanded to its present annual
capacity of 645,000 tonnes of ethylene in 2016. It is also co-located with on-site derivatives assets, namely
O&P Europe’s LDPE plant and EDC/VCM plants owned by INOVYN, a related company. In addition, the
cracker is connected to dedicated, wholly owned ethylene liquefaction and export terminals from which it
exports products to INEOS derivatives and the merchant market in North West Europe.

While our two standalone polyethylene and polypropylene sites in Lillo and Geel in Belgium are
not co-located on cracker sites, they are connected to major olefin pipelines. Our Lillo site also benefits
from connection to INEOS’ ethylene terminal, which is Europe’s largest, at the INEOS Oxide site in
Zwijndrecht, Antwerp and indirectly with the greater ARG pipeline. In both cases, this infrastructure provides
these facilities with flexibility in sourcing feedstock. Both of these sites benefit from easy access to large
polyolefin markets.

Since acquiring Olefins & Polymers Europe, we have undertaken a significant improvement and
restructuring program across our assets to enhance their long-term cost-competitiveness. In general, cost
efficiencies have been substantially improved across all aspects of the business. The asset base has also been
added to via the acquisition in 2007 of a 50% share in the Noretyl gas cracker at Rafnes and full ownership
of the associated polyolefins at Bamble in Norway. On July 1, 2015, we acquired the other 50% share in the
Noretyl gas cracker from INOVYN, a related party.


-----

In July 2023, affiliates of the Group announced their intention to acquire TotalEnergies’ 50% share
of certain petrochemical assets at Lavéra currently operated as 50:50 joint ventures between TotalEnergies
and the Lavéra Businesses, as well as certain other infrastructure assets associated with the site. A binding sale
and purchase agreement (subject to customary conditions to completion) was signed in October 2023. The
Group will, immediately prior to the acquisition of the TotalEnergies Lavéra Business, complete the Lavéra
Reorganization, following which the acquisition of the TotalEnergies Lavéra Business will occur within
the Group. Upon completion of the Lavéra Acquisition, we will have full ownership of Naphtachimie, which
operates one of Europe’s largest steam crackers with an annual capacity of 720,000 tonnes of ethylene,
Gexaro, an aromatics business with an annual capacity of 270,000 tonnes, and Appryl, a polypropylene
business with an annual capacity of 300,000 tonnes, as well as a number of other infrastructure assets,
including part of TotalEnergies’ ethylene pipeline network in France. The Lavéra Acquisition will bring the
Lavéra Businesses back into the Group, now with full ownership and control and without the limitations
of a joint venture, which we believe will allow us to unlock greater value in the assets.

Significant investments have been made to enhance our assets’ capabilities, including the building
of a swing furnace on the Köln cracker and the conversion of its linear low density polyethylene unit to
highly differentiated metallocene production (a proprietary catalyst technology that permits the production
of super-tough film grades). A key improvement theme of our polyolefins business has been to creep
capacities and reduce plant costs. We aim to run our downstream assets as close to their maximum capacity
as is operationally prudent while seeking to constantly improve the sales portfolio by focusing on products
that can command sustainably higher margins in bottom of cycle conditions over commodity grades, which
we refer to as “differentiated” products. We take advantage of our proprietary process technologies, such
as at Lillo (Innovene S), at Geel (Innovene P) and at Köln (Innovene G). These state of the art advanced
technologies allow us to manufacture distinctive resins.

The most substantial recent investment that was made in our assets was in 2015 at Rafnes, with the
completion of a new ethane import tank and new ethane furnace. These investments were timed to coincide
with the commission of NGL/LPG export facilities in the U.S. through which we have secured long-term,
advantaged U.S. gas feedstock, associated with the shale oil and gas developments in that country. This new
source of ethane complements our existing local sources of feedstocks. In 2020, the butane tank in
Antwerp was completed which, along with dedicated barges, allows the Köln cracker to increase the
proportion of butane used in its feedstock thereby increasing the feedstock flexibility

Our manufacturing facilities are periodically shut down for scheduled turnarounds, to carry out
necessary inspections, testing to comply with industry regulations and any maintenance activities that may
be necessary. Olefins crackers typically undergo major turnarounds every five to six years, with each
turnaround lasting four to six weeks. Our Rafnes gas cracker is on a seven to nine year turnaround cycle.
Polymers units are subject to more frequent maintenance shutdowns, typically one turnaround every one or
two years, but in this case each turnaround lasts only seven to 10 days. A significant focus in prior years
was placed on enhancing process safety and further improving reliability by initiating a series of process
safety audits and reliability reviews to give assurance about the adequacy of our critical safety management
systems and that the necessary plans are in place to drive very high levels of reliability.

**_Raw Materials and Energy_**

The primary feedstocks for our olefin crackers are naphtha and natural gas liquids, namely ethane,
propane and butane. The use of naphtha results in the production of a significant amount of co-products
such as propylene, butadiene and benzene, as well as Raffinate 1 and gasoline blending components. The use
of natural gas liquids results in the production of a smaller amount of these co-products. From 2016, our
Köln naphtha requirements have been sourced from several external suppliers under contract, with the balance
being purchased in the open market.

We continue to look for sources of attractive feedstock and in 2012 we announced the completion
of supply and infrastructure agreements that secured a significant volume of ethane feedstock from the
U.S. for use in our Norwegian cracker. Since then, further ethane and LPG supply agreements have been
secured from these advantaged U.S. shale gas sources to complement our existing local sources. In addition,
a new infrastructure contract was signed in 2015 which allowed us to export feedstocks from the new
Enterprise facility at Morgan’s Point on the Texas coast. Contracts for eight “Dragon” vessels to transport
these feedstocks to Europe were signed in 2013, with all ships having now been delivered and fully operational.
Contracts for two “VLEC” vessels (cargo capacity approximately three times larger than the “Dragons”)
to transport feedstocks around the world were signed in 2017, and both have been delivered and are fully


-----

operational. The first shipment using these vessels took place in 2019 with supply of U.S. ethane to China
being the main activity.

The first shipment of ethane from the Marcus Hook Facility in Pennsylvania was exported from
the U.S. in March 2016 on the JS INEOS Intrepid, and the first ethane cargo from Morgan’s Point was
exported in September 2016 on the JS INEOS Insight.

Although energy is generated at several of our sites, including as part of petrochemical
manufacturing processes, we are a significant net purchaser of both electricity and gas. In the past we have
typically procured our requirements from local producers or utilities at local market prices; however, we are
increasingly moving to a more integrated process to take more advantage of our scale and changing
energy markets across the wider INEOS Group, including our ultimate parent company and its other
subsidiaries.

**_Customers and Contracts_**

In total, we had approximately 835 customers worldwide during the 12-month period ended
September 30, 2023, who are serviced by an in-house team of business, sales and technical service personnel.
Customers of our olefins business tend to be major European petrochemical companies, who use our
products to make a wide range of polymers, synthetic rubber, intermediates and specialty chemicals. In our
downstream business we sell to a large number of companies in a variety of plastic conversion industries
involving rigid and flexible packaging, pipe, car fuel systems, rotomolding, wire and cable, medical and other
industrial and consumer products. In Olefins & Polymers Europe as a whole, in the 12-month period
ended September 30, 2023, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of our annual revenues and
our top 10 customers accounted for less than 42% of our annual revenues.

In our olefins business the majority of our ethylene, propylene, raffinate 1 and benzene production
is sold to other INEOS olefin-derivative businesses at market-related transfer prices. For the 12-month
period ended September 30, 2023, approximately 67% of the olefin requirements of our downstream
polyolefin business was satisfied by internal supply from our own crackers, while the rest was sourced from
the open market. Our remaining production of ethylene, propylene, butadiene, raffinate 1, benzene, toluene
and gasoline blends are sold directly to customers predominately via contracts of one to three years
duration, with pricing either freely negotiated, cost-plus or market-referenced such as ICIS or Platts. Product
pricing can therefore change daily or monthly.

In our polymers business sales are mainly conducted under contract. The majority of these
contracts are annual with longer durations by exception. Pricing in these contracts is cost-plus or based on
market references, such as ICIS or Platts, or negotiated on a monthly basis.

In April 2020, our polymer business announced a collaboration with Plastic Energy on the
construction of a new plant to convert waste plastic into the raw material to make new plastic. Advanced
recycling technology converts waste plastic back to its basic molecules. The resulting material is then used in
INEOS crackers to replace traditional raw materials derived from oil.

In July 2022, we announced our joining the Digital Watermarks Initiative HolyGrail 2.0 (an
initiative driven by AIM—European Brands Association and powered by the Alliance to End Plastic
Waste) to significantly improve the sorting and recycling of plastic packaging waste. The initiative aims to
address and improve how plastic waste is sorted into different types, making the recycling of household
plastic waste far more efficient. Although plastic packaging collection rates are improving across Europe,
challenges in sorting mean that recycled plastics are often a mix of types and grades, making the recycled
product difficult for plastics converters to reuse. Digital watermarks are imperceptible codes which cover the
surface of the packaging. They are around the size of a postage stamp, imperceptible to the human eye,
but detectable by special cameras linked to high speed waste sorting systems.

**_Products_**

Our olefin products—ethylene, propylene, butadiene, mixed butenes, and crude benzene—are the
basic building blocks for a vast family of petrochemicals produced by our chemical manufacturing customers.
A significant portion of our olefin output serves as feedstock for our polymers production, while the
remaining output is sold to affiliates and third parties.

The type of polyethylene we currently manufacture in Olefins & Polymers North America is slurry
loop high-density polyethylene. Our high-density polyethylene products are sold to customers for use in
manufacturing food packaging, household chemical containers, pipe, injection-molded products such as caps
and closures, and crates and pails. Our polypropylene is transformed into crates and trays, roofing
membranes, food packaging, carpets, automotive products, rope and toys. During the twelve-month period
ended September 30, 2023, consumables such as caps, closures, film and packaging represented a majority
of our polymer sales volume.

Along with Olefins and Polyethylene, Polypropylene is a major product, with manufacturing lines
at the Chocolate Bayou, Battleground and the Carson manufacturing facilities. Polypropylene is produced
with a combination of produced raw materials (Propylene from the Olefins crackers) as well as third-party
purchased propylene. Polypropylene is then shipped by rail and truck to various end-users in North
America and abroad.

O&P North America also manufactures Polyethylene pipe through our subsidiary, WL Plastics.
WL Plastics is solidly positioned as a leader in the North American plastic pipe industry. WL Plastics is a
leading manufacturer and distributor of HDPE tubular products for fluid and material transfer applications
primarily for energy and industrial infrastructure applications with a deep product mix of pipe diameters
of [1]∕2 inch to 54 inches. In December of 2021, WL Plastics acquired the Polyethylene assets of Charter
Plastics in Titusville, Pennsylvania. The Titusville site and associated assets have the capability of producing
a broad range of polyethylene pipe for numerous end-uses including potable water, reclaimed water, sewer,
geothermal, gas, irrigation, and industrial applications.

O&P North America is a fully integrated business from the production of hydrocarbons through
to fabrication of polyethylene pipes.

**_Manufacturing_**

The key assets of Olefins & Polymers North America include the following:

     - the Chocolate Bayou, Texas, facility, one of the largest cracker installations in North America as
well as two on-site polypropylene units (PP3 & PP4);

     - the Battleground, Texas, facility, one of the largest North American high-density polyethylene
facilities, inclusive of the Gemini and heritage Polyethylene assets, integrated with the Chocolate
Bayou site through a company-owned pipeline system as well as the BMC Line 3 polypropylene
unit;

    - a 50% ownership interest in the Horizon high-density polyethylene plant located at Chevron
Phillips’ Cedar Bayou, Texas, site;

    - the Carson polypropylene plant—integrated with the Marathon refinery at Carson, California;

     - the Hobbs fractionation unit, which can process 1,455 kta of natural gas liquids feedstock for
our Chocolate Bayou cracker;


-----

    - the WL Plastics fabrication and distribution locations include Mills, Wyoming; Rapid City,
South Dakota; Cedar City, Utah; Elizabethtown, Kentucky; Statesboro, Georgia; Snyder, Bowie
and Lubbock, Texas; and as of January 2022 Titusville, Pennsylvania an asset acquisition
from Charter Plastics with a production capacity of 45 kta.

All of the olefins crackers are either co-located with, or connected by pipeline to, polymers units,
enabling them to realize economies of scale, improve their facilities’ energy management and minimize
logistics costs.

In North America, our olefins and polymers business comprises five sites including major facilities
in Chocolate Bayou, Texas, and Battleground, Texas. As of September 30, 2023, the Chocolate Bayou and
Battleground facilities (including the 100% share of the Gemini HDPE output) had total production capacity
of approximately 4,606 kta inclusive of olefins, polyethylene and polypropylene finished goods.

Chocolate Bayou is one of the largest cracker installations in the Gulf Coast region and, according
to NexantECA, is the fifth largest site by ethylene capacity in the United States. The site has access to
cavern storage, rail service, and approximately 500 miles of pipeline, either owned or leased by us. This allows
integration to our polymer assets and our Hobbs fractionation unit, and permits the site to place its
surplus ethylene and other products either directly in the local merchant market or in storage to bridge time
lags between production and consumption. The scale of the Chocolate Bayou crackers should also enable
the leveraging of the facility’s infrastructure and workforce. Another key strength of the facility is the crackers’
flexible design. While their main feedstock is natural gas liquid gas-based feedstock, which is obtained
from various sources, including a significant amount from our natural gas liquid fractionator near Hobbs,
New Mexico, the commodity markets and Marathon’s refinery in Texas City, Texas, the facility also has the
ability to process naphtha. This flexibility enables management of feedstock mix in response to changes
in economic and market conditions. All of our polymers facilities in North America are either connected
with the Chocolate Bayou crackers or are adjacent to facilities operated by third parties with whom we have
feedstock arrangements.

For our North American polymers business, our key facility is the site at Battleground, Texas,
which hosts both polypropylene and high-density polyethylene production. As of December 31, 2020, the
previous 50:50 Gemini HDPE joint venture between the Group and Sasol Limited was purchased and it
became 100%-owned by the Group. Our high-density polyethylene site is one of the largest high-density
polyethylene complexes in North America. Battleground is integrated with Chocolate Bayou by way of a
pipeline system owned by INEOS. Complementing our Battleground polymers production is our Carson
polypropylene unit and our 50% ownership interest in the Cedar Bayou Horizon high-density polyethylene
line. The Horizon line, which is operated by Chevron Phillips, is one of the largest single slurry loop high
density polyethylene lines in North America.

**_Raw Materials and Energy_**

Our procurement efforts remain focused on expanding access to low cost materials, services and
equipment and creating independence from sole or limited sources of supply. We are connected via pipeline
to multiple hydrocarbon suppliers at Chocolate Bayou Works and Battleground Manufacturing Complex
to ensure a secure supply at reasonable costs.

We, together with our North American affiliates, have centralized the purchasing of energy, natural
gas, rail routes, ethylene, propylene (including refinery-, chemical- and polymer-grades), providing scale,
common voice in the market and, in the cases of ethylene and propylene, flexibility to manage our supply
and demand. Our olefins and polymers business primarily uses naphtha and NGLs as the basic feedstocks for
our olefins crackers.

Although most external feedstock supplies of the business are available from a variety of third
parties, our Carson polypropylene plant depends on raw materials from the Marathon refinery located on
the same site. Most of the petrochemical feedstocks purchased from Marathon are part of a long-term
contractual agreement. In addition, a substantial proportion of our feedstock requirements is also obtained
on the commodity markets. We manage the procurement and trading of our feedstocks internally.

Although energy is generated at several of our sites, including as part of petrochemical manufacturing
processes, we are a significant net purchaser of gas. Typically, we procure our requirements from local
producers or utilities at local market prices.


-----

**_Customers and Contracts_**

We work with customers to meet evolving market requirements. We market our products both
directly—business to business—and through authorized distributors. We have a small base of olefins
customers and approximately 350 polymer customers worldwide. Our industrial customers include a large
number of companies in a variety of downstream industries involving rigid packaging, fibers and flexible
packaging.

Most of our olefins sales are by multi-year contracts, with prices subject to monthly industry
pricing. Our polymer sales are to customers in the merchant market and are made either on contract or
spot terms. Some contracts are based on negotiated prices, while others are based on pricing formulas or
refer to spot market rates.

WL Plastics has a premium value proposition to their approximately 150 domestic customers with
industry-leading response times, scalable low-cost manufacturing with longer run times and a reputation
for reliability.

**_Olefins & Polymers Asia_**

On December 28, 2022, and following signature of the shareholders agreement and the equity
transfer agreement signed on July 28, 2022, INEOS acquired 50% of SECCO Petrochemical Company
Limited from Sinopec.

Sinopec is a leading global chemical company, with specific strength in Asia. INEOS has a number
of other joint ventures with Sinopec in other parts of its business and thus has experience in cooperating
with Sinopec.

SECCO is a highly-integrated world-class chemical facility in Shanghai, China, the heritage of
which (from BP) matches the heritage of INEOS’ other assets. SECCO has large chemical units such as an
ethylene cracker with design capacity of 1,190 kta, styrene unit of 650 kta, aromatics extraction unit of
600 kta, acrylonitrile unit of 520 kta, butadiene extraction unit of 180 kta, polyethylene unit of 600 kta,
polystyrene unit of 300 kta and polypropylene unit of 250 kta.

The combination of operating expertise, safety leadership and specific technology know-how
makes INEOS well-suited as a partner for Sinopec in this joint venture. INEOS has extensive experience of
operating all the technology that SECCO uses, and INEOS is the owner of a significant amount of the
technology utilized at the SECCO site.

On August 1, 2023, and following signature of the shareholders agreement signed on November 30,
2022, INEOS completed the formation of a 50:50 joint venture with Sinopec for the Tianjin Nangang
Ethylene Project, which is currently under construction and expected to be on-stream in the second half of
2024.

The Tianjin Nangang Ethylene Project consists of the development and construction of a 1,200 kta
per annum ethylene steam cracker and 12 derivative plants producing a wide range of olefins and olefins
derivatives (including HDPE, LLDPE, POE, UHMWPE, LAO, PP, ACN, BD). This new highly-integrated
world class facility using the latest technologies from Sinopec and INEOS will be the most competitive
base chemicals complex in the Beijing region.

INEOS’ rationale for entering into the SECCO and the Tianjin Nangang Ethylene Project joint
ventures with Sinopec is the natural fit not only from a technology and product perspective, but also as part
of its continued expansion into China and its business partnership with Sinopec. China is a key growth
region for INEOS and the transactions significantly extend its petrochemicals business in the region.

_INEOS Nitriles._ Our main product in the nitriles sector is acrylonitrile. According to NexantECA,
measured by expected average annual capacity for 2023, we are the largest manufacturer of acrylonitrile in
the world. The primary applications for acrylonitrile are acrylic fiber and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene
plastics. We employ safeguards to ensure the safe handling of Nitriles’ products including the use of
specially designed railcars and pipelines for transportation to nearby customers. We believe that our
competitive position in the worldwide acrylonitrile market is strengthened by our proprietary fluid bed
acrylonitrile process and related catalysts.

In addition, the Nitriles business produces acetonitrile, hydrogen cyanide, acetone cyanohydrin,
ammonium sulphate and oxazole and also produces catalysts used in the manufacture of acrylonitrile. In
2019, the ammonia and nitric acid business was transferred to INEOS Nitriles from INEOS Enterprises.
Ammonia production finds major application in the fertilizer industry, but in the case of INEOS Nitriles is
used in the production of acrylonitrile, nylon and other non-fertilizer applications. Nitric acid is similarly
used in the fertilizer industry but for INEOS Nitriles is primarily used in the manufacture of polyurethanes.
In this highly competitive market, we benefit from an advantaged location within our Köln integrated
petrochemical site and supplying more than 80% of our customer volume directly by pipeline.


-----

_INEOS Oligomers._ According to NexantECA, we are one of the largest linear alpha olefins
producer measured by average annual capacity for 2023. NexantECA also believes we are one of the largest
producers of polyalpha olefins worldwide. As a “full range” linear alpha olefins producer, we manufacture
a broad range of co-produced linear alpha olefins and manage production levels consistent with our ability to
utilize or sell the entire product slate. As different segments of the linear alpha olefins market tend to grow
at different rates, the business has developed a variety of internal and external outlets for the key products,
which allow the plants to operate with minimal constraints. Our unique technology does allow some
flexibility to adjust our product slate in order to emphasize certain linear alpha olefins products and deemphasize others as demand fluctuates. Linear alpha olefins are used primarily as comonomers in the
production of polyethylene, as feedstock in the production of poly alpha olefins, detergents, paper sizing
chemicals and lubricant additives and as drilling fluids. Poly alpha olefins are primarily used in synthetic
motor oils, transmission fluids and other demanding lubricant applications such as wind turbines.

Specialty Oligomers products are manufactured from crude C4 and C5 olefinic streams and are used
as base stock or intermediates in a variety of high margin applications such as the manufacture of tires,
compressor oils, agricultural chemicals, plastic additives, specialty chemicals, fragrances and cosmetics.

Our GasSpec™specialty amines, which are high performance specialty chemical formulations,
often patent protected, are used to remove hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide from natural gas, various
refinery streams, ethane cracker feed gas, and ammonia, hydrogen, renewable diesel, and renewable jet fuel
production streams. GasSpec™operates a fully equipped laboratory in Freeport, Texas, that provides
comprehensive analytical support to our customers.

_INEOS Oxide._ We manufacture ethylene and propylene oxide, from which we produce a range of
derivatives including ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, EO and PO alkoxylates and glycol ethers. According
to NexantECA, we are the second largest producer of ethylene oxide and the largest producer of ethylene
glycol in Western Europe as measured by aggregate annual capacity for 2023. Following the completion of the
Bayport Acquisition, we will also be the second largest producer of ethylene oxide in the U.S. as measured
by aggregate annual capacity for 2023, according to NexantECA. By adding significant ethylene oxide and
ethylene glycol capacity in the U.S. to our leading positions in Europe, the Bayport Acquisition will
globalize our Oxides business and give us access to the U.S., the largest ethylene oxide market in the world.

Ethylene oxide is a highly reactive, flammable and toxic molecule. As a consequence, ethylene oxide
producers typically use a significant proportion of their ethylene oxide for captive production or sell it to
third parties located reasonably close to, or on, their ethylene oxide production sites. The majority of ethylene
oxide produced in Western Europe is used for captive production and there are virtually no ethylene oxide
imports into, or exports from, Western Europe. INEOS Oxide uses its ethylene oxide production for the
captive production of ethylene glycol, ethylene oxide derivatives and sales to third parties on its sites in
Antwerp and Köln.

Our ethylene oxide derivatives include ethanolamine, a broad range of alkoxylates, and glycol
ethers. We own and operate one of the world’s largest ethanolamine units and produce a family of molecules
that are used in applications such as agrochemicals, surfactants (used in personal care products and
detergent formulations), cement additives, textile chemicals, metal working fluids, electronics and pigments.
We have six alkoxylate reactors based in Antwerp, which we use to make a broad range of alkoxylates
used in household detergents, herbicides, industrial cleaners, petroleum production, cosmetics,
pharmaceuticals, synthetic lubricants and surface coating. We also operate one of Europe’s largest glycol
ether assets to produce a range of methyl, ethyl and butyl glycol ethers used as solvents in surface coatings
and inks, and as jet fuel de-icers.

We are one of only three commercially viable suppliers of ethylidene norbornene (ENB) monomer
globally and the only producer in Europe. Ethylidene norbornene monomer is used in the production of
ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) rubber, a high performance rubber that is both wear and
weather resistant and is increasingly used in place of conventional rubbers in automobiles, roofing materials
and household appliances.

Ethylene glycol is used primarily as a feedstock to produce polyethylene terephthalate for film,
fiber and resin and in a variety of other industrial applications including antifreeze/coolants for automotive
vehicles.

NexantECA believes we have the largest ethyl acetate plant in Europe with the product being
primarily used as a solvent and diluent, favored because of its low cost, low toxicity and agreeable odor.
For example, it is commonly used to clean circuit boards and as nail varnish remover. Coffee beans and tea


-----

leaves are decaffeinated with this solvent. It is also used in paints as an activator or hardener and is present
in confectionery, perfumes and fruits.

_INEOS Phenol._ According to NexantECA, measured by average annual capacity in 2023, we are
the largest producer of phenol in the world. Our global manufacturing capacity is more than two times that
of our closest competitor. Phenol is a primary material for a large number of chemical products. In
recent years, the use of phenol for the production of bisphenol A, an intermediate product used to produce
polycarbonate and epoxy resins, has increased substantially and is now the largest phenol application.
Polycarbonate is an engineering thermoplastic material which, due to its superior optical qualities, structural
strength and weight, has a wide range of uses, including; CDs and DVDs, optic-fibers, optical lenses,
bulletproof glass and other ballistic resistant materials, structural parts in cars and trucks and housings for
electrical household appliances and office equipment. Epoxy resins are used in a wide variety of applications
including coatings, adhesives and composite materials, such as carbon fiber.

Phenol is also combined with formaldehyde to produce phenolic resins, which represent the second
largest commercial use of phenol. Phenolic resins are used in a wide range of applications, including
plywood and oriented strand board, furniture, insulation materials, laminates, foundry molds and adhesives.

The next largest application for phenol is as the raw material for caprolactam and adipic acid for
the production of nylon intermediates. Major uses include engineering thermoplastics and synthetic fibers
for clothing and carpeting.

Since phenol and acetone are produced together in a fixed ratio, we are also the largest producer of
acetone in the world with more than twice as much capacity as the next largest competitor. The largest
commercial use of acetone is for solvents, either through the use of acetone itself as a solvent or through
the acetone-based production of solvents. The second largest commercial use of acetone is the manufacture
of methylmethacrylate. Methylmethacrylate is used to manufacture polymethylmethacrylate resins,
including acrylic sheets and compounds for molding and extrusion. Acrylic sheets and compounds are used
in a wide range of architectural and industrial applications, ranging from point of sale retail displays to
glazing and decorative light panels. The third major use of acetone is in the production of bisphenol A.

Bisphenol A (BPA) is a chemical produced in large quantities and used primarily in the production
of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins. BPA is utilized in many end-use consumer products to increase
their durability and toughness. While polycarbonate and epoxy resins are the major applications for BPA,
other uses include flame retardants, unsaturated polyester resins, polysulfone resins, polyetherimide resins,
and polyarylate resins. BPA is becoming more important because of the rising investment into downstream
integration. Demand for PC is driven by the electronics/electrical sector.

Epoxy resins are the second-largest end use with leading applications in coatings. Other epoxy resin
demand sectors include electrical/electronics, adhesives, construction, and composites.

Alphamethylstyrene is formed as an intermediate product during the phenol and acetone production
process. It is used in heat resistant thermoplastics, tackifiers, coatings and antioxidants.

**_Manufacturing_**

INEOS Nitriles operates from three sites, two in the United States and one in Europe. Our Green
Lake, Texas, facility is one of the largest facilities for acrylonitrile and related products in the world. The
second U.S. site is in Lima, Ohio, and is an integrated nitriles complex, producing acrylonitrile and related
products, with access to feedstock from an adjacent refinery. Lima also manufactures acrylonitrile catalysts
for other facilities on a global basis. In Europe, we manufacture acrylonitrile, ammonia and nitric acid in
Köln, Germany.

INEOS Oligomers operates from five sites split across North America and Europe. Joffre, in
Alberta, Canada produces linear alpha olefins from low-cost ethylene derived from Canadian and North
Dakota gas. The other North American assets are located in Texas, United States. The LaPorte site
manufactures poly alpha olefins starting from certain cuts of linear alpha olefin. The high viscosity poly
alpha olefins facility at La Porte is currently being expanded. The Chocolate-Bayou site produces linear alpha
olefins, primarily using ethylene supplied from the adjacent O&P Chocolate-Bayou crackers. In addition,
the 120 kta poly alpha olefins plant at Chocolate Bayou, Texas, is the largest poly alpha olefins plant in the
world. In Europe, production of linear alpha olefins and poly alpha olefins occurs in Feluy, Belgium and
specialty oligomers are manufactured in Köln, Germany.


-----

INEOS Oxide currently operates from four main sites: Antwerp, Belgium; Plaquemine, Louisiana,
United States; Köln, Germany and Hull, United Kingdom. Following completion of the Bayport
Acquisition, we will also have a fifth main site in Texas, USA. Our largest production facility is at the
Antwerp complex in the second largest European harbor- and second largest chemical region in the world.
This site has direct or indirect connections to three major ethylene pipelines linking it to most ethylene crackers
in Northwest Europe as well as a deep-sea import terminal for Ethylene. It also has pipeline connections
to pipelines for nitrogen, oxygen, natural gas and ship/rail logistic capabilities for sourcing bulk feedstock
of propylene oxide, butadiene, acetic acid and alcohols. In addition, the site has its own jetty facility on the
Schelde River which links it to the Port of Antwerp and the Amsterdam Rotterdam Antwerp (“ARA”)
pipeline and with rail and road tanker loading facilities. We produce ethanolamine at our Plaquemine plant
located on the Mississippi/Gulf Coast of the United States. This is a prime location for chemicals
production due to advantaged access to feedstock and direct access to sea jetties and close proximity to our
customer base.

INEOS Phenol operates phenol and acetone plants at sites in Gladbeck, Germany; Antwerp,
Belgium; and Mobile, Alabama in the United States, as well as a fully integrated cumene-phenol acetone
plant with additional bisphenol A production in Singapore. All three phenol and acetone sites in Europe and
the USA use our own proprietary technology, which has significant advantages in energy consumption
and other factors over competing technologies. The Singapore plant uses technology from Mitsui, Japan,
with low energy consumption. This technology is mature and proven in practice. Our Gladbeck plant is
located in the industrial heartland of Germany known as the “Ruhrgebiet”. It receives its raw materials by
pipeline from an INEOS-owned cumene plant (Marl), as well as other suppliers, and the finished products
go out by rail and truck with most customers situated within a 100 kilometer radius. It is the largest single
train unit in the world. According to NexantECA, our Gladbeck facility is the largest single-train phenol
plant in the world, and our Antwerp site is the largest capacity phenol site outside of China. Our Antwerp
site is located in the Antwerp industrial area with direct deepwater access. All of the cumene reaches the site
via ship. The majority of the site’s end-products are transported to customers by ship, with the balance
being transported by road and rail. Our Mobile, Alabama, United States, plant is located on Mobile Bay
on the Gulf of Mexico, close to several major consumers. All cumene is supplied via ship mainly from an
INEOS owned cumene plant (Pasadena, Texas) or from producers on the Gulf Coast or Asia. About half of
the phenol and acetone produced is transported via ship and barge while the balance goes out by rail and
road. Our Singapore plant has more than 1,000 ktpa of capacity, including cumene, phenol, acetone, alphamethylstyrene and bisphenol A, and is located in the heart of Jurong Island, Singapore’s chemical park on
an artificial island hosting, among others, refining and chemical manufacturing. We are connected by pipeline
to key raw material suppliers as well as some end-product customers, but we also receive raw materials via
ship. Our customers are spread over the majority of the Asian continent and are usually served by seagoing vessels with some receiving the material via truck lorries. Besides the cumene-integrated plant in
Singapore, INEOS Phenol operates two cumene plants at sites in Marl, Germany and Pasadena, Texas.

We manufacture catalysts for polyethylene, polypropylene and acrylonitrile, and have established
toll manufacturing arrangements for polypropylene catalysts and some polyethylene catalysts. Manufacturing
facilities exist in Lima, Ohio, United States (acrylonitrile catalysts), Sarralbe, France (polyethylene catalysts)
and Dahej, India (polyolefin catalysts).

**_Raw Materials and Energy_**

Acrylonitrile is manufactured from propylene, ammonia and air with the use of a special catalyst.
Acrylonitrile is toxic and flammable and, unless chemical stabilizers are added for storage and shipment,
can undergo an explosive chemical reaction. We employ safeguards to ensure the safe handling of nitriles,
including the use of specially designed railcars and pipelines for transportation to nearby customers. The key
raw material for ammonia production is natural gas. Natural gas is supplied from utility companies via
pipeline from the German natural gas grid to the Köln plant to manufacture ammonia.

Ethylene is the feedstock for the production of INEOS Oligomers’ range of linear alpha olefins
(Hexene-1 to C20+). At our Joffre plant in Alberta, Canada, ethylene is supplied from the neighboring,


-----

ethane Nova cracker complex facility. Ethylene is secured through a long term supply agreement. In
Europe, the Feluy alpha olefins plant is supplied with ethylene from Antwerp by pipeline connected to the
ARG and via the INEOS deep sea Antwerp terminal. Ethylene supply is secured through long-term supply
agreements, customer tolls and spot purchases. The Chocolate Bayou alpha olefins plant is supplied with
ethylene mainly from the adjacent INEOS O&P Chocolate Bayou ethane crackers but also third-party
contracts. INEOS Oligomers produces poly alpha olefins at the Chocolate Bayou, TX plant, the Laporte,
TX and Feluy plants using selective INEOS Oligomers supplied alpha olefins cuts. The INEOS Cracker
complex in Köln supplies Raffinate 1 and Crude C5 which is, respectively, the feedstock for the C4 isoolefins/
isoparafins unit and the Isoamylene and Cyclopentane units.

INEOS Oxide’s principal raw material is ethylene. Our supply flexibility is bolstered by access to
multiple ethylene pipeline connections and by our ownership of a major deep sea ethylene import terminal,
connected to the ARA pipeline network. We have short and medium-term contracts of one to five years
that generally specify minimum and maximum volumes with several different suppliers. The cost of our key
feedstock ethylene supply is largely based on a discount to the current North-western European contract
price. We also have access to advantaged U.S. ethylene via our ethylene import terminal.

Cumene, which is made from the combination of benzene and propylene, is INEOS Phenol’s main
raw material. INEOS owns cumene plants located in Marl, Germany, which is pipeline connected to the
Gladbeck site and in Pasadena, Texas in the United States. We also make some incidental purchases of
cumene in the open market. As a result of these arrangements, we are exposed to changes in the market
contract and spot rates for benzene and propylene.

**_Customers and Contracts_**

INEOS Nitriles has approximately 80 acrylonitrile customers in more than 180 locations worldwide,
with the top 10 customers accounting for approximately 75% of revenue. Major acrylonitrile customers
include Toray, Chi Mei, LG, Lotte and Synthomer in Asia, SNF in the United States and INEOS Styrolution,
Aksa and SNF in Europe. We are the only acrylonitrile supplier to provide customers with the security of
supply from capacity in the United States and in Europe and we service all key regions of the world: United
States, Europe and Asia (including the Indian subcontinent). Ammonia products are predominantly sold
to on site internal customers for the production of acrylonitrile (INEOS Nitriles) and nitric acid (Covestro),
but also supplied to external customers for a wide range of applications. Our catalyst products are used
internally in our acrylonitrile plants as well as sold to a select number of customers around the globe.

INEOS Oligomers has approximately 350 worldwide customers with its top 10 customers accounting
for approximately 46 % of revenue. Major customers typically include large polyethylene and elastomer
manufacturers, such as Dow, Nova, KNC, global lubricant producers such as Castrol and leading chemical
intermediates, detergents, and drilling fluid companies.

INEOS Oxide sells most of its products to leading chemical manufacturers, including Arkema,
Arlanxeo, BASF, Bayer, Covestro, Proctor & Gamble and Wilmar. The majority of our sales are made
pursuant to short- and medium-term market contracts of one to five years in duration. Under a long-term
swap agreement entered into with Dow Chemical as part of the ethanolamine and GasSpec™gas treating
amines acquisition in February 2001, we swap a significant proportion of our ethylene glycol production
from our Antwerp facilities for an equivalent volume of ethylene oxide production from Dow Chemical’s
ethylene oxide plant in Plaquemine. We generally determine the prices for our chemicals on a monthly basis
based on current market conditions, including raw material costs. Other than ethylene oxide prices, which
are based on the European market price, our prices are generally based on the international market price.

INEOS Phenol sells to most of the major phenol and acetone consumers globally, including
Covestro, Mitsui, Bakelite, Sabic, Evonik, Ascend, Fibrant, Roehm, Count and Azoty. We generate
approximately 58% of our total sales from our 10 largest customers with whom we have developed strong
relationships over more than 50 years of doing business. Many of our sales contracts include provisions
whereby raw material price changes are passed through automatically insulating our margins from volatile
changes in raw material markets.

**_Research and Intellectual Property_**

Our Chemical Intermediates businesses are also supported by a range of technologies, and each
business carries out research and development to improve the different technology platforms, to enhance
environmental performance and, where appropriate, to develop novel products, applications, catalysts and
additives.


-----

A key technology platform is the proprietary fluid bed acrylonitrile process and related catalysts.
We believe that this technology is the leading nitriles manufacturing technology from a cost and operational
performance perspective. In order to sustain the competitiveness of the technology, we invest in the
development and manufacture of improved catalysts. These are critical for achieving high product yields
with high reliability while minimizing emissions and environmental footprint.

Active management of our intellectual property rights allows us to preserve the advantages of the
products we sell and the technologies we use, and helps us to maximize the return on our investment in
research and development. We police our proprietary rights and enforce them against third party
infringements or misappropriations. We own over 2,000 patents or patent applications, in the United States,
Europe, China and various other commercially relevant regions. In addition, we own a number of registered
trademarks. Strict control of our proprietary confidential technical information provides valuable
complementary protection to our other intellectual property rights. In addition to our own intellectual
property, we are party to licensing and other agreements authorizing us to use and sub-license patents, trade
secrets, confidential technical information and related technology owned by third parties.

While we believe that our portfolio of intellectual property rights provides significant competitive
advantages, we do not regard our business as being materially dependent on any single patent, trademark,
trade secret or agreement.

**_Competition_**

Although INEOS Nitriles competes with numerous manufacturers of acrylonitrile, we are the
largest producer in the world. In addition, we believe that a significant majority of the world’s acrylonitrile
capacity is based on our process technology. Our most significant competitor is Asahi Kasei Corporation,
closely followed by Jiangsu Sailboat and PetroChina. Other competitors include Ascend and Cornerstone in
North America and AnQore in Europe. In the global market for ammonia, we face over 150 competitive
production units located in 50 countries. Thirty of these units are within Western Europe.

The main competitors for INEOS Oligomers in linear alpha olefins are Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron
Phillips and Sasol Limited. For poly alpha olefins, major competitors include Chevron Phillips and Exxon
Mobil.

The main competitors of INEOS Oxide in the ethylene glycol, antifreeze, ethylene oxide and
ethylene oxide derivatives markets are BASF, Shell and Dow Chemical, while those in acetate esters include
Celanese, BASF and OQ. Our main competitor in the ethylidene norbornene monomer merchant market
is ENEOS (previously known as JX Nippon Oil & Energy).

In Europe, the major competitors for INEOS Phenol are Cepsa, Novapex, Borealis and Versalis. In
North America, our major competitors are AdvanSix, Shell and Sabic. In Asia, competition is spread
throughout the continent, with major BPA competitors, among others, being LG, Kumho, Sinopec, PTT
and MCI. In Phenol/ Acetone/ AMS, our major competitors are LG, KPB, PTT, MCI, ZPC and Hengli.

**Refining Divestiture, Grangemouth Divestiture and Lavéra Divestiture**

**_The Refining Divestiture_**

On July 1, 2011, subsidiaries of Lux I disposed of (i) the Refining Business and the Entrepreneurial
(Refining) Business to joint ventures formed between PetroChina and INEOS Investments and (ii) the
Infrastructure Entity to a joint venture owned by INEOS Investments (50.0%) and the Refining Business
JV (50.0%), herein referred to as the “Refining Divestiture.” The disposal of the Refining Business, the
Entrepreneurial (Refining) Business and the Infrastructure Entity was principally a disposal of the Refining
segment of the INEOS Group as reported on the financial statements of IGH.

The Refining Business and the Entrepreneurial (Refining) Business disposed of in connection with
the Refining Divestiture consist principally of the crude oil refining operations carried out at the refineries
located at Grangemouth, Scotland, and Lavéra, France, and related entrepreneurial activities. The Refining
Divestiture also involved the transfer to the Infrastructure Entity of certain related infrastructure assets
(principally a power station in Grangemouth, Scotland, and a terminal and other facilities). Following the
Refining Divestiture, the INEOS Group and the Refining Business share certain assets and will continue to
rely on each other for certain goods and services, which include the purchase of feedstock by the INEOS
Group from the Refining Business JV, the sale by the INEOS Group of certain hydrocarbons to the Refining
Business JV and the provision of certain administrative services to each other (such as security, emergency
response, accounting, employee relations, procurement and site management). The Infrastructure Entity


-----

acquired the related infrastructure assets and provides certain infrastructure goods and services (such as
power and access to terminals) to the INEOS Group and the Refining Business JV. The Infrastructure Entity
was transferred by the INEOS Group as part of the Refining Divestiture and is jointly owned by INEOS
Investments and the Refining Business JV. Upon the consummation of the Refining Divestiture, service and
asset-sharing arrangements were executed to govern the ongoing use of the shared infrastructure and
services. The indemnification provisions include the INEOS Group giving an uncapped non-time limited
indemnity to the joint venture in respect of environmental liabilities not related to the Refining Business.

As a result of the Refining Divestiture and related transactions, on July 1, 2011, we received net
cash proceeds (after expenses and agreed completion adjustments) equal to €658.0 million and 400
Ordinary Shares in INEOS Investments, subscribed for at an aggregate subscription price of $1.015 billion.
Until December 2022, the INEOS Group held these ordinary shares in INEOS Investments, and INEOS
Investments was, until such date, consolidated into our financial statements. The ordinary shares have the
right to receive an amount equal to all amounts received by INEOS Investments (net of a good faith estimate
of its audit, company secretarial and other administrative expenses, as determined by the directors of
INEOS Investments) in respect of its investments, including its equity interest in the Refining and
Entrepreneurial JVs and the Infrastructure Entity, and INEOS Investments was obliged to distribute to the
INEOS Group, subject to applicable legal requirements, in the form of dividends or as a return of capital,
all amounts received by it in respect of such investments, less such audit, company secretarial and other
administrative expenses. The holders of the ordinary shares are entitled to, in priority to any payment to
holders of any other class of shares, $1.015 billion of the total capital returned to the voting shareholders.
The ordinary shares were sold to an affiliate that is not part of the Group in December 2022.

**_The Grangemouth Divestiture_**

On October 1, 2013, the Group completed the Grangemouth Divestiture which comprised the
disposal of its Grangemouth petrochemicals operations, including the assets and pension and other
liabilities, to a newly created subsidiary of INEOS Holdings AG, our indirect parent company. The
Grangemouth Divestiture was implemented pursuant to a restructuring designed to address concerns that
the operations carried out by INEOS Commercial Services UK Limited and INEOS Chemicals Grangemouth
Limited at the Grangemouth site had been loss-making for the previous four years, primarily due to a high
fixed-costs base at the Grangemouth site and a decline in suitable feedstock supplies. Accordingly, a survival
plan was implemented to improve its cost base and to enable it to invest in new infrastructure to import
U.S. ethane to the Grangemouth site which will provide a low cost sustainable raw material supply for the
business.

The plan formulated for the survival of the Grangemouth operations required a significant
investment. This investment included investment in infrastructure necessary to allow the site to import
ethane gas from the U.S., including the construction of an import facility and ethane tank. These facilities
were completed during 2016 and the first shipment of ethane gas arrived from the U.S. into Grangemouth in
September 2016. The investment was funded from the proceeds of the issue by INEOS Grangemouth plc
in August 2014 of €285 million 0.75% guaranteed notes due 2019 (the “Guaranteed Notes”), which were
guaranteed by the U.K. government’s Infrastructure Guarantee Scheme. In July 2019, the €285 million of
Guaranteed Notes were redeemed at maturity and replaced with a new €350 million bank facility for the
Grangemouth divested business. The new facility had a three-year term and comprises a €200 million term
loan with a €150 million revolving credit facility. The €200 million affiliate loan between IHL and INEOS
Grangemouth plc was cancelled at the time of executing the new refinancing. INEOS Grangemouth plc
has re-registered as INEOS Grangemouth Limited following the redemption of the Guaranteed Notes. In
July 2020, the term of the €350 million Grangemouth bank facility was extended for a further three years and
matures in 2025.

**_The Lavéra Divestiture_**

On July 1, 2014, our subsidiaries INEOS Group AG and INEOS Europe AG disposed of certain
petrochemical assets and business in France and Italy to a subsidiary of INEOS AG, a company wholly
owned by our ultimate parent INEOS Limited. The disposed businesses comprise a petrochemical business
at the Lavéra site in France as well as certain other business and assets in France and Italy that were
formerly part of our European Olefins & Polymers business unit (the disposed assets and business are
together referred to as the “Lavéra Businesses”). The total consideration for the sale of the Lavéra Businesses
amounted to €200 million and was initially provided in the form of vendor loans. As of December 31,
2015, all of the consideration was received by us in cash.


-----

The disposal was part of a restructuring plan for the Lavéra Businesses with the objective of
improving the reliability and cost base of the Lavéra site.

We continued to provide certain supporting services such as supply chain management, accounting
or logistical services to the Lavéra Businesses following their disposal. Further, our subsidiary INEOS
Europe AG entered into an offtake agreement for ethylene oxide with an entity that is part of the Lavéra
Businesses. These services and agreements with the Lavéra Businesses are engaged in on an arm’s-length basis.

Following the completion of the Lavéra Acquisition, which includes the reacquisition of the
Lavéra Businesses, all of these arrangements will be among Restricted Subsidiaries within the Group.

**_Contractual Arrangements with the Refining and Entrepreneurial JVs_**

To ensure that the companies in the INEOS Group retain access to the feedstocks provided by the
Refining and Entrepreneurial JVs, we have entered into several contractual arrangements with the Refining
Business JV and the Infrastructure Entity. Pursuant to these arrangements, the INEOS Group will retain
access to the feedstocks that are essential to the retained business segments, thereby contributing to the
long-term viability, security and profitability of our businesses.

Our Köln site within our Olefins & Polymers Europe business has entered into standard supply
contracts buying naphtha with the Refining and Entrepreneurial JVs on an arm’s-length basis.

Contracts have been put in place to ensure that the companies in the INEOS Group retain access
to the naphtha feedstock produced by the Refining Business JV at Grangemouth, following the separation
of the Grangemouth petrochemicals business from the INEOS Group in the Grangemouth Divestiture.

**_Contractual Arrangements with the Grangemouth Petrochemicals Business_**

To retain flexibility on polymer sales, and thus optimization of value for the INEOS Group
businesses, the polymer production at Grangemouth is sold to market through the INEOS Group Limited
Risk Distributor companies (“LRDs”). The proceeds (less an agreed sales margin) of the sale of polymer
production at Grangemouth through the LRD network are transferred back to INEOS Commercial
Services UK Limited, one of the entities divested in the Grangemouth Divestiture.

**_Contractual Arrangements with the Lavéra, Sarralbe & Rosignano Petrochemicals Business_**

Historically, the majority of naphtha feedstock produced by the Lavéra refinery has been consumed
by the petrochemicals business at Lavéra. Pursuant to the Lavéra Divestiture, contracts were executed in
order to continue this arrangement. Following the completion of the Lavéra Acquisition these will all be
intergroup transactions.

To retain flexibility on polymer sales, and thus optimization of value for the INEOS Group
businesses, the polymer production at Lavéra, Sarralbe and Rosignano is sold to market through the
INEOS Group LRDs. The proceeds of the sales through the LRD network sales are transferred back to
INEOS Derivatives France Limited (“IDFL”) less an agreed sales margin. Prior to January 1, 2022, the
contractual agreements were with INEOS Derivatives France Limited before being transferred to INEOS
Olefins S.A. under the same terms and conditions. Following the completion of the Lavéra Acquisition these
will all be intergroup transactions.

**Research and Technologies (“R&T”)**

We consider R&T to be a key contributor to both the short-term performance and the long-term
growth of our business.

Our R&T work has four principal objectives:

    - improve the environmental footprint of our products and processes, for example, by reducing
greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions, and enhanced recyclability;

    - minimize production costs with a view to increasing the margins that can be achieved in the
manufacture and sale of our products;

    - make better products in order to sustain or capture more margin or market share; and at the
same time

    - reduce capital costs to minimize the investments necessary to meet demand.


-----

A substantial portion of our R&T expenditure is dedicated to the continuous improvement of our
processes and products to reduce GHG emissions associated with our operations and increase the
recyclability and recycled content of our products. This R&T work is carried out by a combination of site
based teams and centrally located specialists and research teams in one of our R&T centers. R&T projects
typically yield returns within one to five years. We protect our process technologies and products by
seeking patents or retaining them as trade secrets.

We believe that the quality of our scientific staff is important to our success. Our R&T teams have
comprehensive expertise in a variety of areas, including catalysis, process development, product and
material science, modeling and project management. The project teams also possess the necessary commercial
expertise to enable timely implementation of innovations. We consistently aim to improve the effectiveness
of our R&T efforts by targeting our projects at the most valuable applications and using project management
tools to monitor progress. To attract and retain the best-qualified scientists and develop a high level of
capability and competence in the key areas of processes, products and operations, we offer our employees
challenging development opportunities and a competitive compensation package that is aligned with
performance of the relevant business in both the short and long term.

We also draw on external resources to enhance the scope, depth and effectiveness of our internal
R&T efforts. We proactively seek mutually beneficial partnerships with third parties, including other
petrochemical companies, new technology companies, key customers, and leading universities.

**Facilities**

We currently lease the office space for our principal executive offices, which are located in Rolle,
Switzerland. We also lease administrative, technical and sales office space in various locations in the
countries in which we operate.

Our production network comprises 34 manufacturing facilities in seven countries throughout the
world (excluding the SECCO facilities in China, the Group’s 50% interest in which is held through an
Unrestricted Subsidiary which has a capacity of 4,200 kta of petrochemicals including ethylene, propylene,
polyethylene,polypropylene, styrene, polystyrene, acrylonitrile, butadiene, benzene and toluene). The

interest in certain of those plants) will form part of the Group, increasing capacity of the Group by 3,770 ktpa. Additionally,
following completion of the Bayport Acquisition in Texas, USA, our capacity of ethylene oxide will increase by 420 ktpa.

**_Project ONE_**

In addition to our existing facilities, we are currently developing a new large olefins plant in
Antwerp, Belgium, known as Project ONE. Project ONE consists of an ethane steam cracker with a
nameplate capacity of approximately 1,450 kta and associated utilities, tankage and infrastructure. Project
ONE will be fully integrated into the wider European olefins logistics network and will address wider market
needs, which may include demand from INEOS derivative units across the region.

We believe that Project ONE is the largest investment to be made in the European chemical sector
for the past 20 years and is expected to contribute to a reverse in the decline in the European chemical
industry by supporting the growth and development of INEOS’s European customers in the coming years.
INEOS has secured long-term competitively priced ethane feedstock for Project ONE translating into a
tangible and sustainable competitive advantage for INEOS against its peers in Europe.

Project ONE is also important from a sustainability perspective. From the outset, it is expected to
emit less than half of the CO2 of the current best-performing European plants for the same production. By
switching from ethylene sourced elsewhere to ethylene produced by Project ONE, we expect that INEOS’s
customers will be able to reduce the carbon footprint of their ethylene-based end products by more than two
million tonnes per year. The project will strive to achieve carbon neutrality which is expected to be enabled
by, amongst others, the development of hydrogen and/or carbon capture infrastructure in the local industrial
area. Project ONE is targeting to be carbon neutral within 10 years of start-up and is aligned with the EU
taxonomy Regulation 2020/852 for sustainable activities (EU Taxonomy), more specifically on substantial
contribution to the ‘climate change mitigation’ objective.


-----

Project ONE will be strategically located in the Port of Antwerp in Lillo’s existing industrial area
with deep sea access and already connected to major olefin pipelines in Northwest Europe. The project is
expected to boost employment in the Antwerp region and strengthen the position of the chemical industry
as one of the key sectors of the Belgian economy.

INEOS has selected Technip Energies to provide the operating technology for the new ethane
cracker. Latest estimates suggest that the project will represent a capital investment of approximately
€4.2 billion (of which approximately €1.1 billion has been invested by the end of 2023 and approximately
€1.5 billion is expected to be invested in 2024) largely funded by debt secured on the Project ONE assets. See
also “Description of Other Indebtedness—Project ONE Facilities.” The final investment decision was
made in Q1 2022. The environmental permit from the Flanders authorities was received in, and was
immediately effective from, June 2022. The permit was annulled by the Council for Permit Disputes in
Flanders in July 2023, as a result construction, which began on site in the Port of Antwerp in the summer
of 2022, was suspended in the second half of 2023. However, works on Project ONE in other locations (for
example in module yards around the world) continued during this period. In January 2024 a new permit
was granted by the Flemish Minister for Justice and Enforcement, Environment and Spatial Development
and Energy and Tourism. Once the new environmental permit was attained, construction works on the Project
ONE site in the Port of Antwerp resumed and the plant is anticipated to be completed in 2026 and create
450 direct jobs. For risks associated with appeals of the permit and other litigation involving Project ONE,
please see “Future acquisitions or developments—Any future acquisitions or developments may prove
difficult for us to consummate” and “Litigation—We are subject to certain risks related to litigation filed by
or against us, and adverse result may harm our business.”

**Health, Safety, Security and Environment**

**_Overview_**

Our facilities and operations are subject to a wide range of HSSE laws and regulations in all of the
jurisdictions in which we operate. These requirements govern, among other things, the manufacture,
storage, handling, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, wastewater
discharges, air emissions (including GHG emissions), noise emissions, operation and closure of landfills,
human health and safety, process safety and risk management and the clean-up of contaminated sites.
Many of our operations require permits and controls to monitor or prevent pollution. We have incurred,
and will continue to incur, substantial ongoing capital and operating expenditures to ensure compliance with
current and future HSSE laws, regulations and permits or the enforcement of such requirements. Our
aggregate HSSE capital expenditures in 2021 and 2022 totalled approximately €300 million per year. Annual
HSSE capital expenditure for 2023 is expected to be similar.

Violations of HSSE requirements may result in substantial fines or penalties, the imposition of
other civil or criminal sanctions, clean-up costs, claims for personal injury, health or property damages,
requirements to install additional pollution control equipment, or restrictions on, or the suspension of, our
operating permits or activities. At certain sites where we operate, regulators have alleged or we have
otherwise identified potential or actual non-compliance with HSSE laws and/or the permits which authorize
operations at these sites. Some of these allegations or instances of non-compliance are ongoing, and
substantial amounts may need to be spent to attain and/or maintain compliance. In addition, we have in the
past paid, and in the future may pay, penalties to resolve such matters. Our businesses and facilities have
experienced, and in certain cases, are in the process of investigating or remediating, hazardous materials in
the soil and groundwater at locations where we operate and/or adjacent properties and/or natural resources at
public and private lands not owned by us. We continually investigate and remediate contamination at
certain sites where our facilities dispose of hazardous wastes. In addition, HSSE laws and regulations can
impose various financial responsibility requirements on us, and pursuant to these requirements we may be
required to post bonds, create trust funds or provide other assurances that we will be able to address
contamination at our sites and comply with our decommissioning obligations once our facilities reach the
end of their useful lives.

Other HSSE laws and regulations may impose restrictions upon product or raw material use,
import or sale by us or our customers. For example, it is possible that certain of our products or byproducts or the raw materials we use may, in the future, be classified as hazardous or harmful, which could
impact our production or demand for our products and, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our
business and/or results of operations.

We believe that our operations are nonetheless currently in material compliance with all HSSE
laws, regulations and permits. We actively work to address compliance issues in connection with our


-----

operations and properties and we believe that we have systems in place to ensure that environmental costs
and liabilities will not have a material adverse impact on us. Nevertheless, estimates of future environmental
costs and liabilities are inherently imprecise, and the imposition of unanticipated costs or obligations
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations in any
period in which those costs are incurred.

**Major Regulatory Matters and Developments**

**_Air and Climate Change Regulations and Initiatives_**

_EU Emissions Trading System_

Our operations in Europe are covered by the European Union Emissions Trading System (“EU
**ETS”), an EU-wide trading system for industrial GHG emissions. Industrial sites receive or purchase**
allowances to emit GHGs and must surrender one allowance for each ton of carbon dioxide emitted.
Companies which emit fewer tons of GHG emissions than their allowances cover are able to sell the excess
allowances, whereas those which emit more must buy additional allowances through the EU ETS. The number
of allowances to emit GHGs that are received by industrial facilities free of charge has been, and we
expect will continue to be, reduced over time. Accordingly, in the future, we may be required to purchase
more of the allowances we use, or to make emissions reductions at our facilities, which could cause us to incur
additional compliance and/or capital costs and/or adversely impact our production and our results of
operations. In 2022, our costs to purchase emissions allowances under the EU ETS totaled approximately
€20.0 million and annual costs are expected to be similar for 2023 and 2024.

On July 14, 2021, the European Commission adopted a set of proposals to make the EU’s climate,
energy, transport and taxation policies fit for reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by
2030, compared to 1990 levels, many of which have since entered into force. Achieving these emission
reductions will likely impact INEOS operations in the EU requiring further investments over this timeframe.
The EU also introduced the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) which likely will have an
impact on INEOS costs.

_EU Industrial Emissions Directive (IED)_

Our operations are also required to comply with the EU Industrial Emissions Directive (“IED”)
which remains applicable during the transition period. The European Commission regularly publishes new
decisions aiming at reducing emissions to air and water from all chemical sites. We actively participate in the
process to discuss those regulations to defend our interests and better anticipate the need for capital
expenditures which could be required in order to comply with these new rules.

_U.S. Clean Air Act and Climate Change Regulations and Other Regions_

In the United States, the federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”) regulates air emissions from various
sources and requires, among other things, monitoring of specified pollutants, including hazardous air
pollutants, stringent air emission limits and technological controls to reduce emissions to air. Strict federal
and state controls on ozone, carbon monoxide, benzene, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and other emitted
substances impact our activities and increase our operational costs in the United States. In August 2022,
the United States enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which defines new air pollutants regulated
under the CAA and increases the EPA’s budget across air pollution programs, further enhancing its monitoring
and enforcement capabilities.

Growing concern about the sources and impacts of global climate change has led to a number of
legislative and administrative measures, both proposed and enacted, to monitor, regulate and limit carbon
dioxide and other GHG emissions. For example, we are required to monitor and report to the EPA annual
GHG emissions from certain of our U.S. facilities. In addition, the EPA has taken steps to regulate GHG
emissions under the CAA and other existing legislation as comprehensive climate change legislation has not
yet been enacted by the U.S. Congress. We actively monitor state, regional, provincial and federal GHG
initiatives and other regulatory developments in anticipation of any potential impacts on or costs to our
operations. As of January 2021, the U.S. re-joined the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement’s metric for
tracking emissions targets is country-specific “nationally determined contributions” (“NDCs”). The
agreement mandates NDC targets change every five years and reflect each country’s “highest possible
ambition” to reduce GHG emissions. NDCs are reported to the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change Secretariat and filed into an official public registry. The U.S. Congress may consider
comprehensive federal legislation regarding climate change, and as a consequence, various regional initiatives


-----

regarding emissions associated with climate change are in effect or proposed. Although we believe it is
likely that GHG emissions will continue to be regulated in the U.S., and other countries (in addition to the
EU) in the future, we cannot yet predict the form any such additional regulation will take in the chemical
industry itself in various jurisdictions (such as a cap-and-trade program, technology mandate, emissions
tax or other regulatory mechanism) or, consequently, to estimate any costs that we may be required to incur,
for example, to install emissions control equipment, purchase emission allowances or address other
regulatory obligations. We continue to monitor the situation closely.

In addition, the EPA has finalized or proposed several rules relating to emissions reporting and
emissions reductions. We monitor rules within our industrial sector and rules in other sectors that may set a
precedent for ours. Significant capital expenditures could be required for emissions control equipment in
order to comply with these new rules.

In the United States, stringent controls on nitrogen oxides (“NOx”) and hydrocarbon “Volatile
Organic Compound” (“VOC”) emissions, and/or the need to purchase emissions credits for certain
facilities, impact our operations and, indirectly, the cost of our products. Credit pricing is subject to general
economic conditions. NOx and VOC credits have been available and affordable in the markets where we
have previously needed such credits and have not been a deciding factor in growth. There are expected statespecific NOx reduction rules in areas in which we operate facilities that could affect availability and
increase the cost of NOx credits. These expected state NOx reductions rules are expected to also require
installation of further NOx emissions controls within the next five years. The EPA has finalized rules that
will require states to restrict or prohibit emissions that “significantly contribute” to non-attainment of, or
interference with a state’s ability to maintain, the revised ozone standard in other “downwind” states. Both of
these developments may require additional NOx and VOC reductions at our facilities over the next
decade, and could cause us to incur additional compliance and/or capital costs and/or adversely impact our
production and our results of operations. Federal NOx reduction rules and provincial benzene reduction
requirements are also expected in Canada that may require emissions controls or emission credit purchases.

**_The Registration, Evaluation, and Authorization of Chemicals (“REACH”) Regulation, the Classification,_**
**_Labelling and Packaging (“CLP”) Regulation, the Toxic Substances Control Act and the Canadian_**
**_Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (“CEPA”)_**

The EU regulates chemical products within the European Union by imposing on all affected
industries the responsibility for ensuring and demonstrating the safe manufacture, use and disposal of
chemicals. REACH requires the registration of all chemicals manufactured and imported into the European
Union (either alone, in mixtures or in articles) with the European Chemicals Agency (“ECHA”). The
regulation requires formal documentation of the relevant data required for hazard assessments for each
substance registered as well as development of risk assessments for their registered uses. Most uses of high
hazard substances, such as carcinogens, require authorization by the ECHA. We manufacture, process, or use
a number of substances classified as substances of very high concern under REACH. Some of the
intermediates and monomers manufactured within some of our businesses are classified as carcinogenic,
mutagenic, or reprotoxic. REACH requires extensive toxicological data, documentation and risk assessments
for many of our chemical products and raw materials. As a corollary to REACH, the European Union has
also adopted the CLP Regulation to harmonize the European Union’s system of classifying, labelling and
packaging chemical substances with the United Nation’s Globally Harmonized System. The regulation
standardizes communication of hazard information of chemicals and promotes regulatory efficiency. It
introduced new classification criteria, hazard symbols and labelling phrases, while taking account of elements
that are part of the current EU legislation.

In the United States and Canada, our products and raw materials are subject to environmental,
health and industrial hygiene regulations, including TSCA and CEPA, requiring the registration and safety
analysis of the substances contained in them. The U.S. Congress passed the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical
Safety for the 21st Century Act in 2016. The EPA is currently undergoing adoption of the amended TSCA
regulations to comply with the new law’s requirements. The full impact of these amendments to TSCA remains
uncertain and it is possible that they could trigger risk evaluations of certain of our products by the EPA,
which may lead to new or more stringent regulatory obligations and/or restrictions, up to and including
prohibitions on manufacture and sale of certain products. Since December 19, 2016, the EPA designated 20
chemical substances as high-priority and 20 chemical substances as low-priority that are the subject of the
EPA’s initial chemical risk evaluations, as required by TSCA. This list includes multiple chemicals we
manufacture, including carbon tetrachloride, methylene chloride and 1,3-butadiene. Work on the risk
evaluations has already begun, following the mandatory requirement for the EPA to evaluate existing
chemicals with clear and enforceable deadlines. The list of substances is expected to be expanded over time.


-----

Such regulations could result in a key raw material, chemical or other substance being classified or
reclassified as having a toxicological or health-related impact on the environment, users of our products, or
our employees. Such reclassification of one or more of our raw materials or products could affect its
availability and marketability, result in a ban on its purchase or sale, or require us to incur increased costs
to comply with additional notification, labelling or handling requirements.

**_Risk Management—Prevention of Major Accidents and Process Safety_**

Risks are inherent in the chemical and petrochemical businesses, particularly risks associated with
safety, health and the environment, and each of our facilities actively assesses and manages such risks as
required by law. Within the European Union, an EU directive on the control of major accident hazards (the
“Seveso III Directive”), regulates facilities that present a risk of accidents involving dangerous substances
and imposes specific plans and procedures on them, particularly for the storage of such substances. The
Seveso III Directive, which replaced the previous Seveso II Directive on June 1, 2015, provides for control
measures aimed at preventing and limiting the consequences of major accidents. All of our major
production sites are in the top tier of regulation under the Seveso III Directive due to the quantity of
dangerous substances stored at them. As such, we must establish a major accident prevention policy, safety
reporting system, safety management system and emergency plan compliant with the requirements of the
Seveso III Directive.

In the United States, our manufacturing facilities are subject to the EPA’s Risk Management
Program (“RMP”), which requires facilities that produce, handle, process, distribute or store certain highly
hazardous chemicals to develop a risk management plan and program in the event of an accidental
release of such chemicals. RMP also requires facilities to assess potential impacts to off-site populations in
the event of a credible worst-case release and to document the policies, procedures, equipment and work
practices in place to mitigate identified risks. Similar risk management requirements are imposed upon
our facilities under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, which contains chemical
emergency response planning, accident release and other reporting and notification requirements
applicable to our U.S. manufacturing facilities.

In addition, our U.S. facilities are subject to standards including the OSHA Process Safety
Management (“PSM”) standard, which requires development of a program to manage workplace risks
associated with highly hazardous chemicals. To better manage risks and process safety we pursue certifications
within OSHA’s Voluntary Protection Program (“VPP”), and our Battleground (Houston) and Chocolate
Bayou sites are certified to Star status, the highest level achievable. Star level means that the site has
successfully implemented a safety and health management system and achieved a combined injury and
illness rate that is below the industry rate nationwide. In addition, many of our U.S. sites also report PSM
incidents as required by API 754 as part of the database maintained by the American Fuel and Petrochemical
Manufacturers association.

Programs employed to manage PSM risks include instrumentation and overpressure relief devices.
Industry standards such as ISA 84, an international standard that addresses the application of safetyinstrumented systems for process industries with IEC 61508/511 being the European equivalent, are used.
Our pressure relief systems are reviewed and designed to relevant legal (OSHA, ASME, NFPA, PED, ISO),
industry (API, DIERS) and internal standards. In addition, all of our businesses are aware that effective
safety management is required to address and deal with major accident and process safety risks. We promote
personal leadership for the management of these risks and the Board of Directors for each business
operates a “Letter of Assurance” process whereby each of the Operations Directors/Site Managers reviews
compliance with local regulations and the effectiveness of the safety management system. They then formally
inform their Executive Team and Chief Executive in writing about any issues about which they need to be
concerned. This process is intended to provide assurance that all businesses are in compliance in all material
respects with applicable health, safety and environmental laws in the countries in which they operate.

**_Environmental Remediation and Closure Liabilities_**

Many of our sites have an extended history of industrial chemical processing, storage and related
activities, and sites with known or suspected contamination exist in our portfolio. We are currently, and
from time to time have been or may be, required to investigate and remediate releases of hazardous materials
or contamination at or migrating from certain of these sites, as well as properties we formerly owned,
leased or operated. We could also be responsible for investigating and cleaning up contamination at off-site
locations where our predecessors or we disposed of or arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous
wastes. Under some environmental laws, liability can be imposed regardless of whether the owner or operator


-----

knew of or caused the contamination and regardless of whether the practices that resulted in the
contamination were legal at the time they occurred. In connection with contaminated properties, as well as
our operations generally, we also could be subject to claims by government authorities, individuals and other
third parties seeking damages for alleged personal injury or property damage resulting from hazardous
substance contamination or exposure caused by our operations, facilities or products.

Baseline surveys of soil and groundwater conditions were conducted at many of our sites in the
European Union in connection with obtaining our Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control permits,
and such data was reported to the relevant authorities. In addition, many of our other sites were the subject
of intrusive investigations when they were acquired by us or in connection with historical activities or
operational changes over the years. The process of investigation and remediation can be lengthy, varies
from site to site and is subject to changing legal requirements and developing technologies. We are not
currently aware of any additional sites as to which material claims or clean-up obligations exist. The discovery
of previously unknown contamination, however, or the imposition of new obligations to investigate or
remediate contamination at our facilities, could result in substantial unanticipated costs. Additionally, if the
EPA or other regulatory agencies (in the U.S. and other countries) adopt more stringent regulations
pertaining to PFAS in the environment, the Group may be required to incur significant clean-up costs. We
could be required to establish or substantially increase financial reserves for such obligations or liabilities and,
if we fail to accurately predict the amount or timing of such costs, the related impact on our business,
financial condition or results of operations in any period in which those costs need to be incurred could be
material.

**_Product Stewardship and Innovation_**

Many of our products have some hazardous properties, and some of them require specialized
handling procedures due to their acute and chronic toxicity. Our polymer products have widespread end
uses in a variety of tightly regulated consumer industries, including in food packaging and medical
applications. To manage these risks, our product stewardship team works closely with industry associations,
government regulators and others to develop regulations, which are based in science and are commensurate
with the magnitude of the risk.

**_Security and Crisis Management_**

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) requires compliance by our facilities as
defined in the Marine Transportation Security Act (“MTSA”), the Chemical Facilities Anti-Terrorism
Standards (“CFATS”) and U.S. Department of Transportation Hazardous Materials regulations.

The DHS, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Administration and individual state emergency
management regulators require that all sites hosting emergency response teams train responders. It is
required that the emergency response teams and incident management teams have the knowledge, skills and
equipment to allow them to work in concert with local, state, and Federal agencies in a framework defined
by the National Incident Management System (“NIMS”). NIMS or equivalent training is conducted at sites
to meet the intent of NIMS requirements. This allows the site responders to join with the governmental
group in cases of widespread emergencies, including pandemics, where multiple agencies and organizations
are involved.

**_HSSE Principles_**

We remain very strongly committed to excellent HSSE performance and believe we are a top decile
performer within the chemicals industry. In 2013, INEOS converted its safety performance monitoring to
mirror the U.S. OSHA standard. This enabled a common platform for comparisons and increased the number
and types of injury data collected and analyzed. INEOS’ OSHA rate for the combined INEOS and
contractor workforce has decreased in recent years from a high of 0.52 injuries per 200,000 hours in 2013 to
only 0.18 in 2021, 0.16 in 2022 and 0.19 in 2023 which increased due to the addition of newly acquired
businesses. We strive to operate throughout the world with a commitment to doing what is needed to protect
the environment and to comply with all applicable regulations in the countries in which we operate. Our
focus is on prevention of process safety incidents and we have developed internal HSSE audit programs (20
SHE principles) designed to monitor and correct any deviations from acceptable performance.

Our aim is to avoid injuries to the community, employees and contractors. We focus on reducing
major plant losses of containment of chemicals with health and safety impact. Core to our HSSE standards
is our HSSE policy, which promotes executive management and individual responsibility, adherence to


-----

operating procedures and training and requires our sites to be designed, operated and managed with the
goal of preventing major incidents.

IGH has two 50:50 joint ventures with Sinopec in China. One is in the Jinshan District (Shanghai),
SECCO (Shanghai Ethylene Cracker Complex), and the other is in Tianjin where a world scale cracker and
ethylene/propylene derivatives facility is under construction. We believe that SECCO is compliant with
the Law of the People’s Republic of China on Work Safety (as amended in 2021) which covers all major
regulatory matters such as risk management, major accident and safety prevention, product stewardship and
security and crisis management. The Chinese government recently issued regulation on “Management of
Special Equipment”, which requires operators, supervisors, management and directors to report on a weekly
basis any deviation from normal working conditions for equipment essential to operate the plants in a safe
manner.

**Employees**

As of September 30, 2023, we had approximately 7,500 employees (measured as full-time equivalents
(“FTEs”)) in our operations around the world, excluding employees of our joint ventures. Approximately
59.9% of these employees were located in Europe, approximately 37.9 % were located in North America and
2.2% was located in the rest of the world.

Historically, we have enjoyed good labor relations and we are committed to maintaining these
relationships. Other than management and professional personnel, the majority of our employees are
represented by local trade unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements, including a European
Employee Forum agreement under the European Council 94/45/EC, Article 6, which covers all European
businesses and employees within INEOS Group and is designed to provide a formal mechanism for
management and employee representatives to communicate on significant or potentially significant issues
across the INEOS Group’s European operations.

We value the diversity of our people and each of our employees is recognized as an important
member of our team. Our goal is to attract a diverse range of the highest quality candidates for each
available position, recruiting based on merit following the principles of equal opportunity. In each of our
locations, we directly recruit local talent into our operations and business. These local opportunities are
supplemented by group-wide initiatives such as our Core Graduate Engineering program and European
Commercial Program (designed to attract high quality candidates who wish to pursue a commercial rather
than technical career). In addition, our requirements and behavioral expectations for employees and businesses
are outlined in our Code of Conduct which is regularly updated and communicated to all employees and
external stakeholders. The code comprises the following sections: Health, safety, security and the environment;
Competition and sanctions; Governance; Government and communities; Financial integrity and company
assets; Human resources; Digital system use and security; and Violations of the code.

**Insurance**

INEOS purchases insurance on an all risk basis, including business interruption (including
consequential loss) and property damage on a replacement cost basis. In addition, we purchase third party
liability insurance, directors & officers, marine cargo, protection & indemnity insurance and life insurance for
all of our employees. We believe our policies are in accordance with customary industry practices, including
deductibles and coverage amounts. Our broker, lead insurers and underwriters perform risk engineering
surveys and routinely inspect all assets. We have an ongoing program to regularly revalue our assets. The
insurance replacement value of our assets (excluding the Project ONE Facilities and the Rain Facilities)
property damage is approximately €33 billion as of September 30, 2023.

**Legal proceedings**

As is the case with many companies in the chemical industry, we are and may from time to time
become a party to claims and lawsuits incidental to the ordinary course of our business. We cannot predict
with certainty the cost of defense, the cost of prosecution or the ultimate outcome of litigation and other
proceedings filed by or against us, including remedies or damage awards, and adverse results in any
litigation and other proceedings may materially harm our business. Litigation and other proceedings may
include, but are not limited to, actions relating to intellectual property, commercial arrangements (including
disputes with contractors, suppliers and customers), environmental matters, permits (including environmental
permits), health and safety, joint venture agreements, mergers and acquisitions, labor and employment or
other harms resulting from the actions of individuals or entities outside of our control. For example, appeals
contesting our environmental permit for Project ONE were filed with the Council for Permit Disputes in


-----

Flanders, Belgium, resulting in a decision to annul the permit on July 2023. In August 2023, IOB filed an
appeal against that annulment decision. As yet no hearing date has been set for that appeal. Although our
amended application, filed on October 4, 2023, for a new permit was granted by the Flemish Minister for
Justice and Enforcement, Environment and Spatial Development and Energy and Tourism on January 7,
2024, had our application been denied and the new permit not granted, this would have had a material adverse
effect on our ability to successfully complete Project ONE within the anticipated timeframe and, if the
new permit is annulled after significant expenditure has been incurred on the project, that could have a
material adverse effect in our business. Although at this time no appeals to the new permit have been filed,
it is expected that one or more parties could challenge the issuance of that permit prior to the expiration of
the appeals period in February 2024. Any such appeal, if successful, could significantly delay the project
and significantly increase costs. If ultimately a permit cannot be retained, it is possible that the project may
not be completed, which would require us to write off significant sunk costs and leave us with significant
debt in connection with facility financing for Project ONE.

In addition, in March 2023, there was a fire and explosion at the INEOS Phenol cumene facility in
Pasadena, Texas involving the ignition of liquid petroleum gas (“LNG”) during unloading. Following the
incident, a lawsuit was filed against INEOS Americas LLC (and its shareholder, INEOS US I Inc, being an
entity unconnected to the incident) in Harris County, Texas, by forty-two plaintiffs alleging injuries as a
result of the incident. The root cause of the incident is still under investigation. INEOS Americas, LLC has
crossclaimed against other potentially responsible parties, including the supplier of the LNG and the
trucking company. Potential damages can not reasonably be estimated at this time; however, there is a risk
that, if determined adversely to INEOS, the matter could have a material adverse effect on our financial
position, business or reputation. Except as otherwise disclosed in this offering memorandum, we are not
currently involved in any legal or arbitration proceedings that are expected to have a material adverse effect
on our financial position and, to our knowledge, no such legal or arbitration proceedings are currently
threatened.

**Sustainability**

Improving the sustainability of our business and operations is central to the way we work. It is of
critical importance to our employees, to our partners and customers, to the communities in which we
operate and to our investors. It drives innovation across all our businesses and sites.

Our sustainability strategy is to develop and safely manufacture the products needed to address the
evolving challenges of climate change, public health, resource scarcity, urbanization and waste in a way
which helps to drive our business and stakeholders a Net Zero Emissions Economy by 2050. Our strategy is
built on six key pillars:

1. Excellence in Safety, Health and the Environment (SHE)

2. Climate Change—delivery of a net zero business

3. Circular Economy—maximizing the re-use and recycling of our products

4. People—ensuring an equal opportunity environment in which a diverse team of people can
flourish and deliver the innovations we need

5. Communities and the Natural Environment—enhance the communities in which we operate

6. Governance—rigorously sustaining the highest standards of ethics and compliance

Our efforts with respect to sustainability, including our GHG emissions reduction targets, our
reporting of GHG and other emissions, energy and water usage and waste generation, are aligned with the
framework described in the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) and the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals. Two key priorities, Climate Change and the Circular Economy, are summarized below.

**_Climate Change_**

Following the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015, most nation states have recognized the threat
posed by climate change and have set the goal to achieve a Net Zero Emissions Economy by 2050 and are
adopting regulations and legislation to support this objective.

In response, INEOS implemented policies to manage the risks posed by climate change and the
transition to a Net Zero Economy to each of its businesses. It has also identified a number of potential new


-----

business opportunities arising from the transition, Internal climate change risk assessments will be regularly
updated in the context of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate change scenarios.
These are sceanrios in which temperature rise compared to the pre-industrial period temperature is limited to
2° C or less, 2-4.5° C, and 5-8.5° C, respectively. An INEOS-wide target has been set to achieve 33%
reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 (compared to 2019) and net zero emissions by 2050. In line with this,
the INEOS Group Holdings businesses have each developed a roadmap which outlines plans and key actions
required to deliver the 2030 targets. The Group anticipates investing more than €3 billion in the next three
years in projects which will reduce emissions intensity.

Actions include the following:

    - Continuous improvement of energy and process efficiency

         - We are working across all our business and sites to make important reductions in energy
use and associated GHG emissions.

    - Exploring investment in green hydrogen and blue hydrogen for use as a fuel on sites and as a
feedstock

         - For example, we are assessing a project to deliver green hydrogen for production of
green ammonia.

     - Increased purchase of renewable energy to substitute for fossil-derived energy

        - We have already signed power purchase agreements for approximately 290 MW of
renewable energy to reduce our dependence on fossil-based energy sources within the
IGH Group. This includes renewable power from a new solar farm project in Texas which
should be completed by the end of 2025.

    - Investment in new assets and infrastructure to enable a step change in GHG emissions

        - For example, we are constructing the Project ONE new cracker complex in the Port of
Antwerp for production of the olefin intermediates used to manufacture polymers and
other high value products which, when we start up by the end of 2026 will emit less
than half of the CO2 emissions compared with the next best existing European steam
cracker. Moreover, we have plans in place to make this a net zero emissions cracker within
10 years of start-up.

    - Use of bio-based feedstocks to reduce dependency on fossil-based materials and deliver bio-based
products

        - We have launched certified bio-attributed olefins with over 90% GHG savings when
compared with conventional materials

     - Investment in carbon capture for selected assets and testing of carbon storage in the North Sea.
Carbon dioxide captured from an IGH Group asset has been stored in the North Sea as part of the
first phase of Project Greensands, a consortium of Danish and international partners, including
INEOS, working towards enabling Denmark to use CO2 storage to combat climate change.

**_Products & the Circular Economy_**

We believe that our products already make a critical contribution to society by providing some of
the most sustainable options for a wide range of societal needs. Examples include preservation of food and
clean water, manufacture of wind turbines, solar panels and other renewable technologies, construction
of lighter and more efficient vehicles and aircraft, production of medical devices and applications,
manufacture of clothing and apparel, and materials for insulation and other industrial and home
applications. Studies suggest that if polymers and plastics were to be replaced to the maximum extent in
applications where they can be substituted, overall life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions in Europe would
increase by more than 50%.

It is generally accepted that a move towards a more circular economy, in which materials are reused
and recycled to their maximum extent, is an important component of a more sustainable economy. For
example, in Europe and the UK, legislation is being developed to incentivize recycling of materials, especially
for packaging products. We have updated our targets in this area and are committed to incorporating
825 kt of recycled or bio-sourced material into INEOS products by 2030, which is an INEOS-wide target.

In line with these objectives, and working with our customers, we have designed and launched a
new range of Recycl-IN polyolefin products which incorporate up to 50% of post-consumer recycled


-----

polymer in materials that meet the same exacting specifications as virgin material. We are also seeking to
invest in advanced recycling technologies that will enable waste polymers to be broken down to their
constituent components then reformed back into polymers. For example, we have signed an agreement with
Plastic Energy to build plants to produce 100 kta of raw materials from waste plastic, with production
targeted for 2026. This will enable a much wider range of waste materials to be re-incorporated into polymer
manufacturing. This move towards a circular economy will increase resource efficiency, reduce GHG
emissions, and provide an improved outlet for waste polymers.

**_Sustainability Governance_**

The Chief Executive of each Business Division is accountable for development of a strategy and
plans to ensure that the business remains sustainable in the longer term. The strategy is reviewed annually
with the shareholders. Each business sets targets annually based on its business plan. Progress against targets
is reported and reviewed at Executive Committee (EXCO) meetings with the shareholders, typically six
times per year.

In addition, there is also an INEOS-wide ESG committee comprising the CEOs and functional
Group Directors to provide functional governance of sustainability. It oversees the activity of crossbusiness networks on climate-related matters and issues recommendations to INEOS’ shareholders who
ultimately sanction group-wide targets and policies that are enforced through INEOS’ federal reporting
structure once approved.

These INEOS-wide targets include SHE, GHG emissions reductions, and, for the Polymers
businesses, recycling targets.

In addition to formal governance processes, INEOS operates a Climate and Energy Network
(CEN) which helps ensure coordination across all INEOS businesses on carbon, energy and resource
matters. Cross-business CEN teams share information and best practices on policy, advocacy, external
developments, new business opportunities and innovation. The network also assembles data from the
different businesses to provide business and INEOS-wide views on GHG emissions, energy usage, water
usage, and waste. The network has more than 1,000 active members across all INEOS businesses.

In addition, we have developed a methodology to calculate carbon footprints and prepare consistent
emission reduction roadmaps. Our methodology is a robust tool for emissions accounting in carbon dioxide
equivalent (“CO2e”) terms aligned with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. The data collection is managed
centrally through the CEN, using a shared online platform. Our reporting is in line with the Global Reporting
Initiative (“GRI”) guidelines, which are set by an international independent standard organization and
which aim to enable third parties to assess environmental impacts from the activities of the company and
its supply chain. Furthermore, we have completed the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) climate change
survey in order to gain external validation for our initiatives.

Our efforts are aligned with 10 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (“United
**Nations SDGs”), with particular emphasis on the following areas: good health and well-being, clean water**
and sanitation, affordable and clean energy, decent work and economic growth, industry, innovation and
infrastructure, sustainable cities and communities, responsible consumption and production, climate
action, life below water and partnerships for the goals. In addition to the United Nations SDGs, we also
support the 10 principles of the United Nations Global Compact.

We also engage with key stakeholders to understand sustainability topics relating to the business
that are important to them. To inform our sustainability strategy and reporting, INEOS identifies topics
that are material for the Group by undertaking regular materiality assessments. For our 2022 sustainability
report, this was conducted in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative GRI 3 standard, where
materiality is defined in terms of impact on the economy, environment and people.

We are also a signatory to the International Council of Chemical Associations’ (ICCA) Responsible
Care Global Charter. By following the guidelines and measures of Responsible Care, we commit to safely
conducting our business in an ethical and environmentally responsible manner and providing the foundation
for development and capital investments. We are committed to fulfilling the Registration, Evaluation,
Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”) obligations, which ensure that companies manage
the risks associated with their products and provide customers with the information they need to handle
them in a safe and sustainable way. We are also a signatory of Operation Clean Sweep, a voluntary stewardship
program of the Plastics Industry Association (PLASTICS) and the American Chemistry Council. We


-----

apply their commitment to achieve zero pellet, flake and powder loss across our sites and supply chain. We
are committed to keeping this material out of the marine environment.

Safe handling and containment of our chemicals and products is of critical importance to us. To
monitor our performance, we have developed a measure to give us early warning of any risks and
opportunities to improve. Each of the materials we use has a maximum legally permitted level at which its
leakage into the environment is tolerated. However, leakage of materials to that level is rare. Our processes,
operating procedures and working practices are all designed to secure containment of all products and
raw materials. The loss of containment of any materials is extremely rare, but each has a level that is legally
reportable to the authorities. We closely monitor all systems and we have internal reporting systems that
trigger internal investigation and reporting where there is any loss of containment that is 10% of the reportable
level (“LOC(10)”). The frequency of LOC(10) across wider INEOS has decreased significantly over the
last 10 years.

**_Summary of Risks_**

Management has in place a number of actions to mitigate climate and climate related risks, as well
as other risks associated with developing legislation on sustainability and reporting. A summary of responses
to key risks is summarized below.

INEOS is also working to ensure that it is compliant with the emerging reporting requirements in
Europe, the UK and elsewhere.

**_Sustainalytics Rating_**

As of October 12, 2023, INEOS Group Holdings S.A. received an ESG Risk Rating of 16.7 from
Sustainalytics, and was assessed to be at low risk of experiencing material financial impacts from ESG
factors. INEOS Group Holdings S.A.’s ESG Risk Rating ranking us as 11th best (11th lowest risk) of 576
chemical companies so far assessed, and 4th best of 273 commodity chemical companies assessed to date. We
believe that this ESG Risk Rating is evidence that we are seen as a leader in implementing sustainable
practices in our industry. Our ESG Risk Rating is subject to change and the current rating can be found on
the Sustainalytics website. For information on the risks related to ESG Risk Ratings see “ESG Ratings”
and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Businesses and Industries—ESG Risk Ratings—The third-party
ESG Risk Ratings referenced in this offering memorandum may not accurately reflect our risks based on
environmental, social and governance matters. Any actual or perceived lack of transparency or
underperformance regarding ESG matters as a result of increasing scrutiny and changing expectations
from investors, lender and other market participants may adversely affect the value of the Notes.”

**_EcoVadis Gold Award_**

Our progress on sustainability has been recognized by the achievement of a gold award for INEOS
AG, one of our ultimate parent undertakings, in a sustainability assessment by EcoVadis in December 2022.
This assessment looks in detail at INEOS AG’s work on environment, ethics, labor and human rights, and

An Unrestricted Subsidiary of the Group, Gemini HDPE LLC (the “Gemini Borrower”), has
€600 million aggregate principal amount of term loans (the “Gemini Term Loans”) outstanding under a
credit agreement dated as of August 7, 2014 (as amended and restated as of December 31, 2020) (the “Gemini
**Term Loan Agreement”) among the Gemini Borrower, the lenders party thereto, Barclays Bank PLC, as**
administrative agent, and Citibank, N.A., as security agent. The Gemini Borrower is the owner of the Gemini
high-density polyethylene (“HDPE”) manufacturing facility in La Porte, Texas.

The Gemini Term Loans do not benefit from any security interests over assets of, or direct
guarantees from, IGH or its Restricted Subsidiaries. However, the Gemini Term Loans are supported by a
tolling agreement pursuant to which the Gemini Borrower manufactures HDPE products for its direct
shareholders, INEOS Gemini HDPE Holding Company LLC and INEOS Gemini HDPE LLC, which are
also Unrestricted Subsidiaries (the “Gemini Shareholders”). The Gemini Shareholders pay the Gemini
Borrower for such HDPE products (including amounts to fund the payments due under the Gemini Term
Loans, excluding, among other things, any mandatory prepayments of principal of the Gemini Term Loans
and any payment of principal of the Gemini Term Loans that becomes due and payable upon acceleration
for reasons other than certain defaults under the tolling agreement), and the tolling agreement obligations are
guaranteed on an unsecured basis by IGH. A Restricted Subsidiary of the Group is the operator of the
facility and has been designated by the Gemini Shareholders, in accordance with the tolling agreement, with
the exclusive right to supply the Gemini Borrower with the required components necessary for the
production of the HDPE products at the capacity rights of the Gemini Shareholders under the tolling
agreement and to take the quantity of the HDPE products corresponding to the production rights of the
Gemini Shareholders under the tolling agreement and, as compensation, has agreed to pay to the Gemini
Shareholders (or as directed by them) an amount equal to the toll fee payable by the Gemini Shareholders
under the tolling agreement.

**_Interest and Fees_**

The Gemini Term Loans bear interest at a rate determined by reference to either (i) Adjusted Term
SOFR (as defined in the Gemini Term Loan Agreement) (subject to a floor of 0.50% per annum) plus the
Applicable Margin specified below for such loans (“Adjusted Term SOFR Loans”) or (ii) the Base Rate
(subject to a floor of 1.50%) plus the Applicable Margin specified below for such loans (“Base Rate
**Loans”).**

The Base Rate is a rate per annum determined as the highest of (a) the rate of interest quoted on
such day in the print edition of The Wall Street Journal, Money Rates Section as the “prime rate”, (b) the


-----

Federal Funds rate plus 0.50% and (c) the Adjusted Term SOFR for an interest period of one month
(giving effect to the applicable Adjusted Term SOFR floor) plus 1.00%.

The Applicable Margins for the Gemini Term Loans are:

    - in the case of Adjusted Term SOFR Loans, 3.00% per annum; and

    - in the case of Base Rate Loans, 2.00% per annum.

All of the Gemini Term Loans were Adjusted Term SOFR Loans as of September 30, 2023.

Overdue amounts owing under the Gemini Term Loan Agreement bear interest (a) in the case of
overdue principal and overdue interest thereon, at the interest rate that would otherwise be applicable to
such principal plus 2% per annum and (b) in the case of other overdue amounts, at the interest rate that would
apply to the unpaid principal amount of Base Rate Loans plus 2% per annum.

The Gemini Term Loan Agreement includes a mechanism for establishing an alternate rate of
interest to Term SOFR in certain circumstances, such as when the administrator of Term SOFR publicly
announces that such administrator has ceased or will cease to provide Term SOFR permanently or indefinitely.
On June 30, 2023, publication of the overnight and 12-month LIBOR for U.S. dollars and the one-month,
three-month and six-month LIBOR for U.S. dollars was discontinued. As a result of these developments, we
amended the Gemini Term Loan Agreement on April 19, 2023 to accommodate the phase-out of LIBOR
for U.S. dollars. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Capital Structure—Changes
or uncertainty in respect of EURIBOR, SOFR or other interest rate benchmarks may affect our sources
of funding, increasing our interest cost and reducing cash flow.”

**_Security and Guarantees_**

The Gemini Term Loans are secured by first priority liens on (i) substantially all assets of the
Gemini Borrower with customary exceptions and (ii) 100% of the equity interests in the Gemini Borrower.
Currently, there are no guarantors under the Gemini Term Loan Agreement; however, the Gemini Term Loan
Agreement requires any new subsidiary of the Gemini Borrower to become a guarantor and grant security
over its assets to secure the Gemini Term Loans.

**_Covenants_**

Subject to certain agreed exceptions, the Gemini Term Loan Agreement contains negative covenants,
including, inter alia, covenants restricting the ability of the Gemini Borrower to incur additional indebtedness;
make restricted payments, including dividends or other distributions; make certain investments; create or
incur certain liens; transfer or sell certain assets; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; enter into sale/
leaseback transactions; change the nature of its business; undertake certain fundamental changes, including
to consolidate, merge or liquidate; amend the tolling agreement and related guarantee and certain other
material project documents; amend its organizational documents; change its accounting policies, reporting
practices or fiscal year; enter into certain hedging arrangements; and make capital expenditures.

The Gemini Term Loan Agreement also contains certain affirmative covenants, including, inter alia,
covenants relating to the provision of financial statements and certain other information and notices;
inspections; maintenance of certain insurance; filing of tax returns and payment of taxes; preservation of
existence; compliance with laws (including environmental laws); maintenance of governmental authorizations;
maintenance of the HDPE facility; additional guarantors and security; use of proceeds; further assurances;
bank accounts; maintenance of corporate separateness; use of commercially reasonable efforts to maintain
certain ratings; performance of contractual obligations; and books and records.

The Gemini Term Loan Agreement does not contain any financial maintenance covenants.

**_Repayment_**

The Gemini Term Loans are to be repaid in quarterly installments according to a mortgage-style
amortization schedule with 30% of the loan amortizing by the maturity date. The balance of the Gemini
Term Loans outstanding will be payable on December 31, 2027. No amounts repaid in respect of the Gemini
Term Loans may be reborrowed.

**_Prepayments_**

Mandatory prepayments of the Gemini Term Loans are required in an amount equal to (i) the net
cash proceeds from certain incurrences of debt and (ii) the net cash proceeds from certain asset sales,


-----

insurance proceeds related to casualty events and eminent domain proceeds, in each case under clause
(ii) that are not reinvested by the Gemini Borrower.

All mandatory prepayments of the Gemini Term Loans will be made without premium or penalty
(except for reimbursement of breakage and redeployment costs in the case of Adjusted Eurodollar Rate
Loans) and will be applied to scheduled amortization installments of principal of the Gemini Term Loans
in such order as the Gemini Borrower may specify.

Voluntary prepayments of the Gemini Term Loans are permitted without premium or penalty
(except for reimbursement of breakage and redeployment costs in the case of Adjusted Eurodollar Rate
Loans) and will be applied to the remaining scheduled amortization installments of principal of the Gemini
Term Loans as directed by the Gemini Borrower.

**_Events of Default_**

The Gemini Term Loan Agreement sets out certain events of default, the occurrence of which
would allow the lenders to accelerate all outstanding loans, including, among other events and subject in
certain cases to grace periods, thresholds and other qualifications: non-payment of amounts due under the
Gemini Term Loans or under the other Financing Documents (as defined in the Gemini Term Loan
Agreement) or under the tolling agreement guarantee; breach of covenants; inaccuracy of representations
and warranties in any material respect; cross defaults and certain judgment defaults; invalidity of the Gemini
Term Loan Agreement and other Financing Documents; invalidity of security interests; certain bankruptcy
and insolvency events; the occurrence of certain ERISA-related events; defaults under the project
agreements, including the tolling agreement and related guarantee; abandonment of the HDPE facility; and
the occurrence of a change of control.

**_Miscellaneous_**

The Gemini Term Loan Agreement permits the Gemini Borrower to request extensions of the final
maturity of all or a portion of the Gemini Term Loans and, in that connection, there may be an increase in
the interest rates and/or fees payable with respect to the extended Gemini Term Loans. Such extensions
shall be subject to certain conditions described in the Gemini Term Loan Agreement.

The Gemini Term Loan Agreement contains “yank a bank” provisions allowing the Gemini
Borrower to replace a non-consenting lender in connection with (1) amendments and waivers requiring the
consent of all lenders or all affected lenders (or all affected lenders of a particular class of lenders) so
long as the required lenders (or, where the consent of the required lenders is not required, a majority in
interest of the lenders of the relevant class) have consented to such amendments or waivers, (2) any lender
becoming a Defaulting Lender (as defined in the Gemini Term Loan Agreement), (3) any lender failing to
consent to any Extension/Modification Request (as defined in the Gemini Term Loan Agreement) made
to such lender and (4) requests by a lender for compensation for increased costs, taxes and similar items.

The Gemini Term Loan Agreement contains loan buyback provisions, which permit, among other
things, the Gemini Borrower to purchase Gemini Term Loans from lenders pursuant to open-market or
other transactions or a Dutch auction, subject to certain conditions, including a requirement that the loans
purchased are automatically and permanently cancelled.

The Gemini Term Loan Agreement is governed by New York law.

**Project ONE Facilities**

**_Overview_**

On December 22, 2022, INEOS Olefins Belgium NV (the “Project ONE Borrower”) entered into
certain agreements (collectively, the “Project ONE Finance Documents”) providing for loans in an aggregate
principal amount of €3,500 million under (i) facilities guaranteed by export credit agencies (UKEF, SACE
and CESCE), (ii) a facility partially guaranteed by Gigarant (a special purpose vehicle of the Flemish
government) and (iii) a commercial facility (collectively, the “Project ONE Facilities”) to fund the construction
of Project ONE, a 1,450 ktpa ethane cracker and olefins complex located in the Port of Antwerp. At the
date of this offering memorandum €522 million has been drawn under the Project ONE Facilities; we expect
the remainder to be used (i) to repay the Project ONE Interim Facility (see also “Project ONE Interim
Facility”) and (ii) to fund further expenses in stages throughout the construction period to 2026.

During the construction phase, the Project ONE Facilities are supported by a debt service
undertaking provided by IGH, IHL and INEOS US I Inc. (“INEOS US I” and, together with IHL, the


-----

“Co-Sponsors”), which will be released upon satisfaction of certain conditions at the completion of
construction, including a lenders’ reliability test. In addition, the Project ONE Borrower entered into a
long-term tolling agreement with INEOS Europe AG (“IEAG”), pursuant to which IEAG is required to
pay the Project ONE Borrower, among other amounts, a tolling fee to cover all of the Project ONE Borrower’s
operating costs (including financing costs) and enable the Project ONE Borrower to maintain a minimum
debt service coverage ratio. The obligations under the Project ONE tolling agreement are guaranteed on an
unsecured basis by IGH.

**_Interest and Fees_**

The Project ONE Facilities bear interest at a rate determined by reference to EURIBOR plus the
applicable margins for such loans.

The applicable margins for the Project ONE Facilities are:

    - in the case of the UKEF covered facility, 0.90% per annum;

    - in the case of the CESCE covered facility, 1.20% per annum;

    - in the case of the SACE covered facility, 1.25% per annum;

     - in the case of the commercial facility, from financial close until its seventh anniversary, 2.75%
per annum; from the seventh anniversary of financial close until (and including) its tenth
anniversary, 3.25% per annum; and from the tenth anniversary of financial close, 3.50% per
annum; and

     - in the case of the Gigarant covered facility, a variable margin that is commercially equivalent to
0.70% on the covered portion of facility (with such portion decreasing over time) and the applicable
commercial facility margin on the uncovered portion of the Gigarant facility.

Overdue amounts owing under the Project ONE Facilities bear interest at a rate which is 1% per
annum above the rate which would have been payable if the overdue amount had constituted a loan under
the relevant facility.

From financial close until January 31, 2028, at least 70% and no more than 110% of the loan under
the Project ONE Facilities are required to be hedged (or provided on a fixed rate basis).

**_Security_**

The Project ONE Facilities are secured by first ranking perfected security over all or substantially
all of the Project ONE Borrower’s rights, title and interest in and to the assets and undertakings relating to
all of its immovable assets, movable assets, receivables and bank accounts, insurances, investments, book
debts, intragroup agreements, hedging agreements and certain key provision documents, including those
rights, title and interest obtained after the execution of the security document creating such security interest.
In addition, INEOS Olefins Belgium Holdings Limited (the “Project ONE Shareholder”) has granted: (i) a
Belgian Law pledge over all of its shares in the Project ONE Borrower; and (ii) an English Law assignment
over shareholder loans made to the Project ONE Borrower.

The secured parties also benefit from the standstill and step-in rights pursuant to agreements
entered into with the counterparties to the tolling agreement, a technology licensing agreement and certain
concession documents relating to the land required for Project ONE within the Port of Antwerp.

**_Repayment_**

The Project ONE Facilities are to be repaid in semi-annual instalments according to an amortization
schedule with the first repayment instalment falling due on the earlier of (i) June 30, 2028 and (ii) the first
June 30 or December 31 to occur after completion of the performance tests with respect to the ethane cracker.
The balance of the Project ONE Facilities outstanding will be payable 108 months after the first repayment
date. No amounts of the Project ONE Facilities repaid may be reborrowed.

**_Prepayments_**

The Project ONE Finance Documents set out certain mandatory prepayment events, including,
among other events and subject in certain cases to qualifications: illegality, sanctions, insurance and
compensation, excess debt, material export contract changes (in respect of the covered facilities) and failure


-----

of the guarantee provided by the relevant credit export agency or Gigarant, as applicable (in respect of the
covered facilities).

Voluntary prepayments of the Project ONE Facilities are permitted, provided that, prior to
completion of construction, voluntary prepayments will be applied on a pro rata basis amongst all Project
ONE Facilities and, after completion of construction, may be applied in prepayment of only the export credit
agency covered loans (on a pro rata basis) and/or in prepayment of only the Gigarant covered facility and
the commercial facility (on a pro rata basis between them).

**_Covenants_**

Subject to certain agreed exceptions, the Project ONE Finance Documents contain negative
covenants, including a negative pledge and restrictions on acquisitions, mergers and disposals, incurring
financial indebtedness, making loans or granting third party guarantees, changing its name, business,
constitutional documents or accounting year, establishing additional accounts, making distributions, settling
claims, use of proceeds, surrendering tax credits and tax losses, entering into new material contracts, and
amending or terminating material contracts (including the tolling agreement and related guarantees).

Subject to certain agreed exceptions, the Project ONE Finance Documents also contain affirmative
covenants applicable to the Project ONE Borrower, including requirements to comply with applicable laws
(including sanctions and anti-corruption laws and regulations), maintain a pari passu ranking for the Project
ONE Facilities, use the proceeds from the Project ONE Facilities for their stated purposes, file, pay and
discharge all taxes, maintain Belgian tax residence, maintain all required permits and consents, construct
Project ONE in accordance with good industry practice and complete Project ONE on time, enforce rights
under the relevant project documents, maintain site and cyber security, cooperate with the lenders and allow
for inspections and audits, diligently operate and maintain Project ONE, acquire and safeguard intellectual
property rights required for Project ONE, appoint and maintain auditors and provide customary
information undertakings (including the provision of ratio statements, financial statements and project
budgets and reports and maintenance of books and records).

Subject to certain agreed exceptions, the Project ONE Finance Documents contain positive
covenants applicable to the Project ONE Shareholder, IGH and IEAG, including a requirement to maintain
legal existence, obtain and maintain applicable consents, comply with applicable laws (including sanctions
and anti-money laundering laws and regulations), file timely tax returns, provide customary information
undertakings (including financial statements) and, only with respect to IGH, (i) use reasonable commercial
efforts to facilitate the transportation and supply of feedstock to Project ONE following an enforcement
action and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain a credit rating from at least one of S&P,
Moody’s or Fitch (but not to maintain a specific rating).

In addition, at all times prior to completion of construction and release of the debt service
undertaking, IGH is required (i) to maintain (on a consolidated basis) a minimum liquidity balance
(including cash, cash equivalents and unutilized liquidity facilities) of at least €1.0 billion and (ii) to post
collateral (in the form of cash or letters of credit) and/or accelerate base equity in an amount equal to
a percentage of unfunded base equity and projected cost overruns, if IGH’s credit rating is downgraded by
2 out of 3 rating agencies (or 1 out of 2 agencies if IGH is only rated by 2 agencies).

Prior to completion of construction and release of the debt service undertaking, if IGH’s credit
rating is downgraded by two out of three rating agencies (or one out of two agencies if the Sponsor is only
rated by two agencies) to B-/B3 or below, a draw stop will occur; after completion of construction and release
of the debt service undertaking, if IGH’s credit rating is downgraded by two out of three rating agencies
(or one out of two rating agencies if the Sponsor is only rated by two agencies), the Project ONE Borrower
will be required to either fund the debt service reserve account (either with cash or letters of credit) with
up to nine months of debt service where IGH is downgraded to B+/B1 and up to 12 months of debt service
if IGH is downgraded to B/B2 or lower. Failure to comply with this undertaking will result in a fundamental
event of default (collectively, the “IGH Credit Provisions”).

**_Events of Default_**

The Project ONE Finance Documents set out certain events of default. Prior to the completion of
construction and release of the debt service undertaking, the lenders are only entitled to accelerate the
Project ONE Facilities and take enforcement action if a fundamental event of default has occurred and is
continuing. Such fundamental events of default are subject in certain cases to agreed-upon grace periods and
include, among others, non-payment, cross-acceleration, insolvency and other credit-related events


-----

affecting the Project ONE Borrower, the Project ONE Shareholder, IGH, IEAG, the Co-Sponsors, IFPLC
or IUSLLC, the finance documents and tolling agreement (and related guarantee) ceasing to be effective,
failure to complete construction by a longstop date, abandonment and cessation of Project ONE,
nationalization, destruction of Project ONE, breach of the share transfer restrictions applicable to the
Project ONE Borrower, failure to comply with the IGH Credit Provisions, and breach of anti-corruption
laws and representations. At any time, if IGH’s credit rating is downgraded by one rating agency to CCC/
Caa2 or lower and by one other rating agency to CCC+/Caa1 or lower, a fundamental event of default will
occur. Other events of default include, among others, and subject in certain cases to agreed-upon grace
periods, breach of covenants and inaccuracy of representations and warranties in any material respect.

**_Current Default and Drawstop_**

On July 20, 2023, the Council of Licensing Disputes annulled the integrated permit
(omgevingsvergunning) granted by the Flemish Government dated June 7, 2022 (the “Initial Integrated
**Permit”), which constituted a temporary default under the Project ONE Facilities and, until cured, relieved**
the lenders under the Project ONE Facilities from having to fund utilizations under the Project ONE
Facilities. This did not constitute an event of default and therefore did not permit the lenders to take any
acceleration or enforcement action described above.

The Flemish Government granted a new integrated permit on January 7, 2024 (the “New Integrated
**Permit”) and, provided that by February 22, 2024 the lenders have not raised any concerns that the terms of**
the New Integrated Permit taken as a whole (i) are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect
or (ii) are otherwise prejudicial to the interests of the lenders in any material respect, the relevant drawstop
will be lifted and further amounts can be drawn under the Project ONE Facilities.

During the period of this drawstop, to enable the project to continue offsite works with a view to
progressing construction of the project, and to mitigate delays from the permit annulment as far as
possible, the lenders under the Project ONE Facilities granted permission for (i) the Project ONE Borrower
to incur an additional interim facility to fund project costs in lieu of the funding under certain Project
ONE Facilities which would, save for the temporary default, be available to fund those project costs and
(ii) the Project ONE Borrower to use the Project ONE Facilities, once the temporary default has been cured,
to apply the proceeds of certain of the Project ONE Facilities to repay the Project ONE Interim Facility.
See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Project ONE Interim Facility” for further details on the terms of
this interim facility.

**_INEOS Group Entity Test_**

Certain credit-related events of default (cross default and insolvency) will apply to IFPLC,
IUSLLC and any other subsidiary of IGH which borrows or issues debt in excess of €400 million (collectively,
the “INEOS Group Entities”).

Each of the Project ONE Borrower and IGH will procure that on each date on which IGH
provides its financial statements to the intercreditor agent, the INEOS Group Entities comprise those
entities that are borrowers or issuers in respect of financial indebtedness pursuant to which IGH is a
borrower, issuer or guarantor (other than the Securitization Program, any inventory financings and the
Project ONE Facilities) that is at least equal to 75% of the aggregate principal amount of such financial
indebtedness outstanding that time. Failure to comply with this provision constitutes a fundamental event of
default allowing for accelerated payments under the debt service undertaking (pre-completion) and the
tolling guarantee (post-completion).

**_Miscellaneous_**

The Project ONE Facilities are required to maintain a debt-to-equity ratio of 65:35 through the
construction period, subject to a true-up to 70:30 at completion of construction.

The Project ONE Borrower is permitted to make distributions after the completion of construction
and release of the debt service undertaking, subject to certain conditions, including no default, a minimum
6-month backward-looking debt service coverage ratio of 1.15:1.00 and a fully funded debt service
reserve account.

At all times prior to the full repayment of the Project ONE Facilities, the Project ONE Shareholder
must hold 100% of the direct legal and beneficial interests in the shares and voting rights in the Project
ONE Borrower. In addition, IGH is required to own (indirectly) (i) more than 75% of the shares of the


-----

Project ONE Borrower until completion of the first major plant turnaround and (ii) more than 50% of the
shares of the Project ONE Borrower thereafter (effectively maintaining control over the Project ONE
Borrower at all times).

The Project ONE Finance Documents are governed by English law, except certain security
documents and direct agreements with Belgian counterparties, which are governed by Belgian law.

**Project ONE Interim Facility**

**_Overview_**

On September 15, 2023, the Project ONE Borrower entered into certain agreements (collectively,
the “Project ONE Interim Funding Finance Documents”) providing for loans in an aggregate principal
amount of €400 million under a facility partially covered by Gigarant (the “Project ONE Interim Facility”)
to fund project costs in lieu of the funding under certain Project ONE Facilities which would, save for the
temporary default, be available to fund those project costs.

**_Interest and Fees_**

The Project ONE Interim Facility bears interest at a rate determined by reference to EURIBOR
plus the applicable margin, which is commercially equivalent to 0.70% on the covered portion of the facility
and 2.75% on the uncovered portion of the facility.

Overdue amounts owing under the Project ONE Interim Facility bear interest at a rate which is
1% per annum above the rate which would have been payable if the overdue amount had constituted a loan
under the Project ONE Interim Facility.

**_Security_**

The Project ONE Borrower’s payment obligations under the Project ONE Interim Funding
Finance Documents are guaranteed by IGH, IHL and INEOS US I Inc. (the “Project ONE Interim
Funding Guarantors”).

**_Repayment_**

The Project ONE Interim Facility is to be repaid on September 13, 2024 unless prepayable earlier.
No amounts of the Project ONE Interim Facility repaid may be reborrowed.

**_Prepayments_**

The Project ONE Interim Funding Finance Documents set out certain mandatory prepayment
events (subject, in certain cases, to qualification), including, among other events: illegality, sanctions, failure
of the guarantee provided by Gigarant and the temporary default under the Project ONE Facilities being
cured—see also “Current default and drawstop”.

Voluntary prepayments of the Project ONE Interim Facility are permitted.

**_Covenants_**

Subject to certain agreed exceptions, the Project ONE Interim Funding Finance Documents
contain negative covenants, including a negative pledge and restrictions on acquisitions, mergers and
disposals, incurring financial indebtedness, making loans or granting third party guarantees, changing its
name, business, constitutional documents or accounting year, establishing additional accounts, making
distributions, settling claims, use of proceeds, surrendering tax credits and tax losses, entering into new
material contracts, and amending or terminating material contracts (including the tolling agreement and
related guarantees).

Subject to certain agreed exceptions, the Project ONE Interim Funding Finance Documents also
contain affirmative covenants applicable to the Project ONE Borrower, including requirements to comply
with applicable laws (including sanctions and anti-corruption laws and regulations), maintain a pari passu
ranking for the Project ONE Interim Facility, use the proceeds from the Project ONE Interim Facility for
their stated purposes, file, pay and discharge all taxes, maintain Belgian tax residence, maintain all required
permits and consents, construct Project ONE in accordance with good industry practice and complete Project
ONE on time, enforce rights under the relevant project documents, maintain site and cyber security,
cooperate with the lenders and allow for inspections and audits, acquire and safeguard intellectual property


-----

rights required for Project ONE, appoint and maintain auditors and provide customary information
undertakings (including the provision of financial statements and project budgets and reports and
maintenance of books and records).

Subject to certain agreed exceptions, the Project ONE Interim Funding Finance Documents
contain positive covenants applicable to the Project ONE Interim Funding Guarantors, including a
requirement to maintain legal existence, obtain and maintain applicable consents, comply with applicable
laws (including sanctions and anti-money laundering laws and regulations), provide customary information
undertakings (including, only with respect to IGH and IHL, undertaking to provide financial statements).

In addition IGH is required (i) to maintain (on a consolidated basis) a minimum liquidity balance

collateral (in the form of cash or letters of credit) and/or accelerate base equity in an amount equal to
a percentage of unfunded base equity and projected cost overruns, if IGH’s credit rating is downgraded by
two out of three rating agencies (or one out of two agencies if IGH is only rated by two agencies).

If IGH’s credit rating is downgraded by two out of three rating agencies (or one out of two agencies
if the Sponsor is only rated by two agencies) to B-/B3 or below, a draw stop will occur. Prior to completion
of construction and release of the debt service undertaking under the Project ONE Facilities, if IGH’s
credit rating is downgraded by two out of three rating agencies (or one out of two agencies if the IGH is
only rated by two agencies) to BB-/Ba3 or below, the Project ONE Borrower will be required to fund, or
provide collateral to the Project ONE Facilities lenders in respect of, between 25% of the unfunded base
equity and projected cost overruns and 100% (if IGH is downgraded to B/B2 or lower). Failure to comply
with this undertaking will result in an event of default (collectively, the “Interim Facility IGH Credit
**Provisions”).**

**_Events of Default_**

The Project ONE Interim Funding Finance Documents set out certain events of default upon
occurrence of which the lenders are entitled to accelerate the Project ONE Interim Facility and take
enforcement action. Such events of default are subject in certain cases to agreed-upon grace periods and
include, among others, non-payment, breach of covenants and inaccuracy of representations and warranties

IUSLLC, the finance documents ceasing to be effective, abandonment or cessation of Project ONE,
nationalization, destruction of Project ONE, breach of the share transfer restrictions applicable to the
Project ONE Borrower, failure to comply with the Interim Facility IGH Credit Provisions, and breach of anticorruption laws and representations.

At any time, if IGH’s credit rating is downgraded by one rating agency to CCC/Caa2 or lower and
by one other rating agency to CCC+/Caa1 or lower, an event of default will occur.

At all times prior to the full repayment of the Project ONE Facilities, the Project ONE Shareholder
must hold 100% of the direct legal and beneficial interests in the shares and voting rights in the Project
ONE Borrower. In addition, IGH is required to own (indirectly) (i) more than 75% of the shares of the
Project ONE Borrower until completion of the first major plant turnaround and (ii) more than 50% of the
shares of the Project ONE Borrower thereafter (effectively maintaining control over the Project ONE
Borrower at all times).

**_INEOS Group Entity Test_**

Certain credit-related events of default (cross default and insolvency) will apply to IFPLC,
IUSLLC and any other subsidiary of IGH which borrows or issues debt in excess of €400 million (collectively,
the “INEOS Group Entities”).

Each of the Project ONE Borrower and IGH will procure that on each date on which IGH
provides its financial statements to the intercreditor agent under the Project ONE Facilities, the INEOS
Group Entities comprise those entities that are borrowers or issuers in respect of financial indebtedness
pursuant to which IGH is a borrower, issuer or guarantor (other than the Securitization Program, any
inventory financings and the Project ONE Facilities) that is at least equal to 75% of the aggregate principal
amount of such financial indebtedness outstanding that time. Failure to comply with this provision
constitutes an event of default.


-----

**_Miscellaneous_**

The Project ONE Borrower is required to maintain a debt-to-equity ratio of 65:35 across the
Project ONE Facilities and the Project ONE Interim Facility.

The Project ONE Interim Funding Finance Documents are governed by English law, except the
Gigarant guarantee related documents, which are governed by Belgian law.

**Letter of Credit Facility**

On May 4, 2012, INEOS Treasury (UK) Limited (the “LC Borrower”), a wholly owned subsidiary
of INEOS Investment Holdings (Germany) Limited, entered into an on-demand letter of credit facility (the
“LC Facility”) with Barclays Bank PLC (the “Issuing Bank”), under which the LC Borrower may request
(on its own behalf or on behalf of other Group companies) the Issuing Bank to issue letters of credit,
guarantees, performance bonds and indemnities (or any other instrument in a form agreed by the Issuing
Bank) (“LC Utilizations”), the outstanding aggregate base currency amount of which is not more than
€300 million. Under the terms of the LC Facility, the LC Borrower undertakes to provide cash collateral in
an amount at least equal to the aggregate of 100% of the maximum actual and/or contingent liability of
the Issuing Bank under each outstanding LC Utilization (or 105%, to the extent cash cover is provided in a
currency other than the currency of an LC Utilization) standing to the credit of an account or certain
accounts of the LC Borrower which are subject to a lien in favor of the Issuing Bank.

**Inventory Financing Facility**

In June 2019, the Group entered into an inventory monetization agreement with J Aron &
Company LLC (“J Aron”), for an initial term of one year which was extendable by mutual agreement (the
“Inventory Financing Facility”). Under this arrangement, the Group sold certain inventory to J Aron and
agreed to buy-back equivalent inventory at the end of the term at the same price. The Group and J Aron
have agreed to a number of extensions, including most recently in June 2023, to extend the term to June 2024.
As part of the most recent extension, J Aron’s rights and obligations pursuant to the Inventory Financing
Facility were novated by mutual consent to Goldman Sachs International (“GSI”). Consequently, during the
term, and subject to certain covenants and rights of GSI, GSI provides the Group with a just-in-time
service for use of the inventory. The Group has the ability to substitute used inventory with equivalent
inventory, in return for a transaction fee, and also to repurchase used inventory for cash. The arrangement
is supported by a Group parent company guarantee and a cash collateral mechanism. The total amount
outstanding at September 30, 2023 before issue costs was €170.5 million (December 31, 2022: €202.6 million).

**Rafnes Facility**

As part of the Group’s purchase of the remaining 50% interest in the Noretyl ethylene cracker at
Rafnes, Norway from the Kerling group on July 1, 2015, the Group assumed the obligations of a
€140.0 million loan facility (previously known as the “Noretyl Facility”) that Noretyl AS (now known as
INEOS Rafnes AS) had in place (as amended and restated from time to time, most recently by an amendment,
restatement and accession agreement dated November 9, 2022, the “Rafnes Facility”). The current size of
the Rafnes Facility is €305.0 million, which amount is fully drawn. The Rafnes Facility bears interest at a rate
per annum equal to EURIBOR (subject to a floor of 0% per annum) plus a margin of (i) prior to
November 10, 2022, 2.10% and (ii) from (and including) November 10, 2022, 2.25%. The facility matures in
November 2027, with the first of six equal semi-annual instalments being made in May 2025. The total
amount outstanding at September 30, 2023 before issue costs was €305.0 million (December 31, 2022:
€305.0 million; December 31, 2021: €214.3 million; December 31, 2020: €250.0 million), none of which is
due within one year (December 31, 2022: nil; December 31, 2021: €71.4 million; December 31, 2020:
€35.7 million). The facility is secured by pledges over the property, plant and equipment of INEOS Rafnes
AS and benefits from an unsecured guarantee from IGH.

**Rain Facilities**

As part of the Group’s acquisition of a 50% interest in the SECCO joint venture in December 2022,
INEOS China Holdings Limited, an Unrestricted Subsidiary, as borrower entered into a RMB 1,045 million
and $525 million term loan facility agreement maturing in June 2026 (the “Rain Facilities”). In April 2023,
the Group successfully completed a syndication of the acquisition financing originally funded in
December 2022. As part of the syndication, which increased the numbers of lenders to 10, the Rain Facilities
were increased to RMB 1,045 million and $785.0 million.


-----

The Rain Facilities carry an interest rate per annum equal to SOFR, subject to certain modifications,
plus a margin of 3.75% (for USD-denominated loans) and HIBOR plus a margin of 4.50% (for RMBdenominated loans), and matures in June 2026. The Rain Facilities are secured by pledges of the shares held
by INEOS Investment (Shanghai) Company Limited (a direct subsidiary of INEOS China Holdings
Limited) in SECCO and of the shares held by INEOS China Holdings Limited in INEOS Investment
(Shanghai) Company Limited and benefits from a parent company guarantee from each of IHL and IGH.

**Securitization Program**

IHL and certain of the other Group companies (such other companies being the “Sellers”) entered
into a receivables securitization facility (as amended, supplemented, varied, novated, extended or replaced
from time to time, the “Securitization Program”). The margins on amounts drawn and the commitment fee on
amounts undrawn under the Securitization Program have been amended from time to time, most recently
on December 21, 2023. The overall facility amount has also been amended from time to time, most recently
to €800.0 million pursuant to an amendment deed dated December 14, 2015. On December 21, 2023, the
scheduled termination date for the facility was extended to December 31, 2026. The Securitization Program
complies with the terms for a Permitted Receivables Securitization as defined in the Senior Secured Term
Loans Agreement.

Under the Securitization Program, all trade receivables originated by the Sellers (other than those
receivables that are specifically identified as “excluded receivables”) are sold to a bankruptcy remote special
purpose vehicle incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Ireland, INEOS Finance (Ireland) Limited
(the “SPV”). The SPV finances these purchases from borrowings, primarily funded through asset backed
commercial paper (“ABCP”) conduits. The cost of funding for the ABCP conduits reflects the rating of
the pooled financial assets in which they invest, thus allowing the Securitization Program to benefit from
financing costs that are not linked to the Group’s corporate rating.

The Securitization Program is restricted to receivables denominated in U.S. dollars, euro or sterling
that are sold to the SPV at face value less a small discount to reflect the carry cost until settlement. In some
jurisdictions, the sale of the receivables requires the involvement of an intermediate purchaser in order to
comply with local securities and banking regulations. The SPV acquires title, on a non-recourse basis, to new
receivables as the liability arises and settles its purchases with the Sellers on a twice-monthly basis. Between
settlement dates, the Sellers have the use of the cash received from customers which has been paid into
segregated bank accounts, either in the name of the SPV or held on trust for the SPV. Responsibility for the
administration of the receivables, including adherence to established credit and collection policies, remains
with the Sellers, with IHL acting on their behalf in its capacity as master servicer.

The twice-monthly settlement period is tied to the term of the loans advanced to the SPV by the
lenders against the security of the outstanding receivables. The lenders’ advance rate is adjusted each month
to reflect the actual performance of the receivables portfolio, and standard Rating Agency methodology
for calculating loss and dilution reserves and other potential shortfalls is applied. The balance of the SPV’s
funding requirements is provided by IHL through a subordinated loan facility.

**Köln CoGen Facility**

As part of a project at the Group’s Köln site to replace part of its incineration or cogeneration
unit, the Group entered into a €120.0 million loan facility on December 22, 2017 (as amended, including by
an amendment and restatement agreement dated April 28, 2021, the “Köln CoGen Facility”). The Köln
CoGen Facility is made up of two loan facilities, the original €120.0 million loan facility and an additional
€60.0 million loan facility. The total amount outstanding under the Köln CoGen Facility at September 30,
2023 was €81.0 million (December 31, 2022: €100.5 million) of which €39.0 million (December 31, 2022:
€39.0 million) was due within one year.

The original facility matures on December 30, 2024, is to be repaid in equal quarterly instalments
of €6.0 million, starting from March 2020, and bears a fixed interest rate of 2.85% per annum. The
€60.0 million additional loan facility was entered into pursuant to the amendment and restatement agreement
dated April 28, 2021 and matures on June 30, 2026. It is to be repaid in equal quarterly instalments of
€3.75 million starting in September 2022 and bears a fixed interest rate of 2.00% per annum. The proceeds
of the additional loan facility may not be used except in relation to the cogeneration unit on the Köln site.

The Köln CoGen Facility is secured by, inter alia, security over the plant and equipment of INEOS
Manufacturing Deutschland GmbH’s new cogeneration assets.

“Senior Security Agent”) for itself, the Senior Lenders, the institutions named therein as hedge counterparties
or cash management banks, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, and any other permitted senior secured
notes issued from time to time (the “Additional Senior Secured Notes”), the trustee under the 2025 Senior
Secured Notes Indenture (the “2025 Senior Secured Notes Trustee”), the trustee under the May 2026 Senior

things, provisions relating to:

     - the relative ranking of certain liabilities of the Obligors;

     - the relative ranking of certain security granted by the Obligors and the Parent;

     - when payments can be made in respect of certain liabilities of the Obligors and the Parent;

    - turnover provisions; and

    - when security and guarantees may be released to permit an enforcement sale.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions contained in the Intercreditor Deed.
It does not restate the Intercreditor Deed in its entirety and we urge you to read that document because it,
and not the discussion that follows, will regulate and govern, among other things, certain of the rights of the
lenders under the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, the
Senior Facility Agent and the Senior Secured Notes Trustees.

**_Ranking and Priority_**

The Intercreditor Deed provides that, subject to the provisions in respect of permitted payments
(summarized below), the liabilities of the Obligors in respect of the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior
Secured Term Loans and certain other liabilities rank, in summary, in the following order and are postponed
and subordinated to any prior ranking liabilities of the Obligors as follows:


-----

     - first, each of the following, pari passu among themselves: (i) the liabilities of the Obligors under
the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement and under any other Additional Senior Finance
Documents (as defined in the Intercreditor Deed), the liabilities of any Obligor party to certain
hedging agreements and cash management arrangements, the liabilities of INEOS Finance plc
and the guarantors under the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Indentures and
any Additional Senior Secured Notes (together, the “Senior Liabilities”), (ii) fees, costs and
expenses of, and amounts incurred by or payable to, the trustee in respect of any High Yield
Notes (the “High Yield Note Trustee Amounts”), (iii) fees, costs and expenses incurred by or
payable to the Senior Facility Agent or any agent appointed to act as security trustee, facility agent
or other similar representative for or with respect to any Additional Senior Finance Parties (as
defined in the Intercreditor Deed) or any agents appointed to act as security agent and security
trustee on behalf of any High Yield Notes or fees, costs and expenses incurred by any Second
Secured Representative (as defined in the Intercreditor Deed) (other than in respect of any
Second Secured Liabilities (as defined in the Intercreditor Deed) in the form of notes issued
pursuant to one or more indentures) (“Agency Amounts”), (iv) fees, costs and expenses of, and
amounts incurred by or payable to, the Senior Secured Notes Trustees and the trustee of any
Additional Senior Secured Notes (each, an “Additional Senior Secured Notes Trustee”) (collectively,
the “Senior Secured Note Trustee Amounts”), and (v) fees, costs and expenses of, and amounts
incurred by or payable to any Second Secured Note Trustee (the “Second Secured Note Trustee
**Amounts”);**

     - second, any Second Secured Liabilities (as defined in the Intercreditor Deed);

     - third, the liabilities of the Obligors in relation to any High Yield Notes (other than in respect of
High Yield Note Trustee Amounts) and the liabilities owed by IHL or Lux I (to the extent it is a
borrower of a High Yield Proceeds Loan (as defined in the Intercreditor Deed)) to the Parent
or any other permitted lenders (such other lenders, together with Parent, the “High Yield Proceeds
**Lenders”) under any loan of the proceeds of any High Yield Notes (together, the “Subordinated**
**High Yield Liabilities”);**

     - fourth, (i) the liabilities of the Obligors to the Subordinated Creditors (other than in respect of
any High Yield Proceeds Loan or any loan of the proceeds of any funds made available under any
documents pursuant to or in connection with which any Second Secured Liabilities arise (the
“Second Secured Documents”) to IHL or Lux I (each, a “Second Secured Proceeds Loan”)), (ii) any
liabilities owed by any High Yield Note Issuer (as defined in the Intercreditor Deed) or any
Additional Second Secured Borrower (as defined in the Intercreditor Deed) to any Subordinated
Creditor under certain investor documents, (iii) any other money or liabilities due, owing or
payable by any Obligor to any High Yield Note Issuer or any Additional Second Secured Borrower
or any parent holding company of the Parent which has acceded to the Intercreditor Deed
(other than in respect of any High Yield Proceeds Loan or any Second Secured Proceeds Loan)
(the liabilities referred to in paragraphs (i) to (iii) being, together, the “Subordinated Liabilities”),
and (iv) any liabilities of the Obligors to the Intra-Group Creditors in such capacity (other
than liabilities under the Senior Secured Notes Proceeds Loans, the Senior Secured Term Loans
Proceeds Loans or certain other loans of the proceeds of any Senior Liabilities to IHL or any
Restricted Subsidiary of the Bottom Swiss Subsidiary (as defined in the Intercreditor Deed)
(collectively, the “Senior Proceeds Loans”)) (the “Intra-Group Liabilities”).

The Intercreditor Deed does not purport to rank any of the Subordinated Liabilities or IntraGroup Liabilities as between themselves. The Intercreditor Deed also provides that, subject to the provisions
in respect of permitted payments, the Subordinated Liabilities are postponed and subordinated until the
Senior Liabilities, liabilities of the Obligors and the Parent to the holders of any High Yield Notes and any
High Yield Notes Trustee (the “High Yield Liabilities”) and the Second Secured Liabilities have been
discharged in full.

The parties to the Intercreditor Deed agree in the Intercreditor Deed that the liens and other
security provided by the Parent and the Obligors rank in the following order:

     - first, the security provided in respect of the Senior Liabilities;

     - second, any security provided separately in respect of the Second Secured Liabilities, if any; and

     - third, the security provided in respect of any High Yield Notes.

Under the Intercreditor Deed, all proceeds from enforcement of security to which the Intercreditor
Deed applies are required to be applied in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Deed, summarized


-----

below under “Application of Proceeds.” Certain security granted by members of the Group (being, for the
purposes of the Intercreditor Deed, Lux I and its subsidiaries), for example certain liens granted by the
Obligors, are not governed by the Intercreditor Deed.

**_Permitted Payments_**

The Intercreditor Deed permits, inter alia, payments to be made by the Obligors, each Additional
Senior Secured Borrower (as defined in the Intercreditor Deed), and each High Yield Note Issuer to the
Senior Lenders under the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes,
the Senior Secured Notes Trustees, (subject to certain restrictions) certain hedge counterparties, certain
cash management banks and to lenders under any Additional Senior Finance Documents and holders of

provided such provisions are in customary form, or (iii) a consent fee payment customary for the

and not prohibited by any payment blockage as described below (except that payments in respect
of High Yield Note Trustee Amounts may always be made);

    - by IHL or Lux I as borrowers under any High Yield Proceeds Loan to any High Yield Proceeds
Lenders in respect of cash interest on any High Yield Proceeds Loan to enable any High Yield
Note Issuer to make a payment of scheduled interest and default interest in respect of any

must fall due within five (5) days of the date of payment of the corresponding interest by IHL
or Lux I to the applicable High Yield Note Issuer, and certain other payments by IHL or Lux I to
any High Yield Proceeds Lender in respect of sums due under any High Yield Notes (as

respect of High Yield Note Trustee Amounts may always be made); and

(iii) on or after the Senior Discharge Date but prior to the date on which all Second Secured
Liabilities have been unconditionally discharged in full (the “Second Secured Discharge Date”),

Prior to the later of the Senior Discharge Date and the Second Secured Discharge Date, no
Obligor, Additional Second Secured Borrower or High Yield Note Issuer or any of their subsidiaries may

to the Second Secured Discharge Date, where the relevant action is prohibited under any Second Secured
Document, of the Majority Second Secured Creditors is obtained.

As defined in the Intercreditor Deed, the term “Instructing Group” means the senior creditors
under the Intercreditor Deed whose senior credit participations at the relevant time constitute the simple
majority in aggregate principal amount of the total senior credit participations at the relevant time.

**_Payment Blockage_**

Prior to the Senior Discharge Date, if any Obligor fails to pay on the due date or within any
applicable grace period any amount payable under the Senior Finance Documents (including relevant
hedging agreements and cash management arrangements), any Additional Senior Finance Document, the
Senior Secured Notes Indentures, the Senior Secured Notes or any indenture of any Additional Senior Secured
Notes (the “Additional Senior Secured Notes Indenture”) or any Additional Senior Secured Notes (all such
senior secured notes and indentures, collectively, the “Senior Secured Notes And Notes Indentures”) (other
than an amount not constituting principal, interest or fees not in excess of €1,000,000 (or its equivalent in
any other currency)), the Obligors may not make payments in respect of the Second Secured Liabilities while
that failure is continuing. Permitted payments in respect of the Second Secured Liabilities may be resumed
when such payment default is cured or waived.

Prior to the Senior Discharge Date, if there is any other default that occurs and is continuing
under the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement, any Additional Senior Finance Documents or any
Senior Secured Notes And Notes Indentures, the Senior Facility Agent (on the instructions of the Majority
Senior Lenders (as defined in the Intercreditor Deed)), or the relevant Additional Senior Facilities
Representative or any Senior Secured Notes Trustee (as applicable) may issue a written stop notice (a
“Second Secured Stop Notice”) to each note trustee, security trustee, facility agent or other similar
representative with respect to any holders of interests representing Second Secured Liabilities (the “Second
**Secured Creditors”) (each, a “Second Secured Representative”) and notify IHL. From the date of the issue of**
such notice, the Obligors may not make payments in respect of the Second Secured Liabilities for a period
of 179 days (the “Second Secured Stop Period”), subject to certain exceptions described below.

Prior to the Senior Discharge Date, from the date of issue of a Second Secured Stop Notice for the
duration of the Second Secured Stop Period, no payments may be made that would otherwise be permitted
by the Intercreditor Deed in respect of the Second Secured Liabilities unless:

    - the event in respect of which the Second Secured Stop Notice was issued has been cured or
waived in writing by (if the default has occurred and is (or immediately prior to the waiver was)
continuing at such time with respect to the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement) the Senior
Facility Agent, (if the default is (or immediately prior to the waiver was) continuing with
respect to any Additional Senior Finance Documents (as defined in the Intercreditor Deed)) the
relevant Additional Senior Facilities Representative, (if the default is (or immediately prior to
the waiver was) continuing with respect to the Notes) the Trustee, (if the default is (or immediately
prior to the waiver was) continuing with respect to the 2028 Senior Secured Notes), the 2028
Senior Secured Notes Trustee, (if the default is (or immediately prior to the waiver was) continuing
with respect to the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes), the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes
Trustee, (if the default is (or immediately prior to the waiver was) continuing with respect to the
March 2026 Senior Secured Notes), the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes Trustee, (if the default
is (or immediately prior to the waiver was) continuing with respect to the 2025 Senior Secured
Notes), the 2025 Senior Secured Notes Trustee and (if the default is (or immediately prior to the
waiver was) continuing with respect to any Additional Senior Secured Notes), the Additional
Senior Secured Notes Trustee relating thereto or has ceased to exist;

     - (if at any time of cancellation or consent, a default is continuing under the Senior Secured Term
Loans Agreement) the Senior Facility Agent, (if at the time of cancellation or consent, a
default is continuing under any Additional Senior Finance Documents) the relevant Additional
Senior Facilities Representative, (if at the time of cancellation or consent, a default is continuing
under the Notes) the Trustee, (if the default is (or immediately prior to the waiver was)
continuing with respect to the 2028 Senior Secured Notes), the 2028 Senior Secured Notes


-----

Trustee, (if at the time of cancellation or consent, a default is continuing under the May 2026
Senior Secured Notes) the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes Trustee, (if at the time of cancellation
or consent, a default is continuing under the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes) the March 2026
Senior Secured Notes Trustee, (if at the time of the cancellation or consent, a default is
continuing under the 2025 Senior Secured Notes) the 2025 Senior Secured Notes Trustee and (if
at the time of cancellation or consent, a default is continuing under any Additional Senior
Secured Notes) the Additional Senior Secured Notes Trustee cancels the Second Secured Stop
Notice or consents to such payment; or

     - if applicable, any Second Secured Standstill Period (as defined below) in effect at the time the
Second Secured Stop Notice was issued has expired and the relevant event of default to which the
Second Secured Standstill Period relates has not been cured or waived.

No Second Secured Stop Notice may be served by the Senior Facility Agent, any Additional Senior
Facilities Representative or any Senior Secured Notes Trustee or Additional Senior Secured Notes Trustee
in reliance on a particular payment blockage event more than 75 days after the Senior Facility Agent, any
Additional Senior Facilities Representative, or any Senior Secured Notes Trustee or Additional Senior
Secured Notes Trustee (as applicable) receives notice in writing specifying the occurrence constituting that
payment blockage event. Not more than one Second Secured Stop Notice may be served with respect to the
same event or set of circumstances. No Second Secured Stop Notice in relation to a payment blockage
event may be served unless (i) 365 days have elapsed since the delivery of any previous Second Secured Stop
Notice in relation to a payment blockage event and (ii) all scheduled payments of interest on the Second
Secured Liabilities that have become due as a result of any previous Second Secured Stop Notice have been
paid in full in cash.

Any failure to make a payment due in respect of the Second Secured Liabilities as a result of the
issue of a Second Secured Stop Notice will not prevent the occurrence of an event of default under the
Second Secured Documents as a consequence of such non-payment or the commencement of an Enforcement
Action (defined below) otherwise permitted by the Intercreditor Deed.

If any Obligor fails to pay on the due date or within any applicable grace period any amount
payable under the Senior Finance Documents (including relevant hedging agreements and cash management
arrangements), any Additional Senior Finance Document, any Senior Secured Notes And Notes Indentures
or any Second Secured Document (other than an amount not constituting principal, interest or fees not
in excess of €1,000,000 (or its equivalent in any other currency)), the Obligors may not make payments (except
if such payment is in the form of Permitted High Yield Note Junior Securities (as defined in the Intercreditor
Deed) or comprises High Yield Note Trustee Amounts) in respect of the Subordinated High Yield
Liabilities while that failure is continuing. Such payments in respect of any High Yield Notes may be
resumed to the extent permitted under the Intercreditor Deed when such payment default is cured or waived.

Prior to the later of the Senior Discharge Date and the Second Secured Discharge Date, if there is
any other default that occurs and is continuing under the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement, any
Additional Senior Finance Document, any Senior Secured Notes And Notes Indentures or, following the
Senior Discharge Date, under any Second Secured Document, the Senior Facility Agent (on the instructions
of the Majority Senior Lenders) or the relevant Additional Senior Facilities Representative, any Senior
Secured Notes Trustee, any Additional Senior Secured Notes Trustee or the relevant Second Secured
Representative (as applicable) may issue a payment blockage notice (a “Stop Notice”) to any High Yield Note
Trustees and notify each High Yield Representative (as defined in the Intercreditor Deed). From the date
of the issue of such notice, the Obligors may not make any payments (except if such payment comprises High
Yield Note Trustee Amounts) in respect of the Subordinated High Yield Liabilities or any High Yield
Proceeds Loan for a period of 179 days (the “High Yield Stop Period”), subject to certain exceptions described
below. Prior to the later of the Senior Discharge Date and the Second Secured Discharge Date, from the
date of issue of a Stop Notice for the duration of the High Yield Stop Period, blocked payments may not
be made unless:

     - the event in respect of which the Stop Notice was issued has been cured or, prior to the Senior
Discharge Date, waived in writing (if the default is (or immediately prior to the waiver was)
continuing with respect to the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement) by the Senior Facility
Agent, (if the default is (or immediately prior to the relevant waiver was) continuing with
respect to any Additional Senior Finance Documents) the relevant Additional Senior Facilities
Representative, (if the default is (or immediately prior to the waiver was) continuing with respect
to the Notes) the Trustee, (if the default is (or immediately prior to the waiver was) continuing

default is (or immediately prior to the waiver was) continuing with respect to the May 2026 Senior
Secured Notes) the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes Trustee, (if the default is (or immediately
prior to the waiver was) continuing with respect to the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes) the
March 2026 Senior Secured Notes Trustee, (if the default is (or immediately prior to the waiver
was) continuing with respect to the 2025 Senior Secured Notes) the 2025 Senior Secured Notes
Trustee, and (if the default is (or immediately prior to the waiver was) continuing with respect
to any Additional Senior Secured Notes) the relevant Additional Senior Secured Notes Trustee or,
following the Senior Discharge Date and prior to the Second Secured Discharge Date, waived
in writing by the relevant Second Secured Representative or has ceased to exist;

     - prior to the Senior Discharge Date, (if at the time of cancellation or consent, a default is
continuing under the Senior Facilities) the Senior Facility Agent, (if at the time of cancellation
or consent, a default is continuing under any Additional Senior Finance Documents) the relevant
Additional Senior Facilities Representative, (if at the time of cancellation or consent, a default
is continuing under the Notes) the Trustee, (if the default is (or immediately prior to the waiver
was) continuing with respect to the 2028 Senior Secured Notes), the 2028 Senior Secured Notes
Trustee, (if at the time of cancellation or consent, a default is continuing under the May 2026
Senior Secured Notes) the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes Trustee, (if at the time of cancellation
or consent, a default is continuing under the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes) the March 2026
Senior Secured Notes Trustee, (if at the time of the cancellation or consent, a default is
continuing under the 2025 Senior Secured Notes) the 2025 Senior Secured Notes Trustee, and (if
at the time of cancellation or consent, a default is continuing under any Additional Senior
Secured Notes) the relevant Additional Senior Secured Notes Trustee cancels the Stop Notice or
consents to such payment;

     - prior to the Senior Discharge Date, the Senior Liabilities have been repaid in full and all the
commitments of the Senior Creditors (as defined in the Intercreditor Deed) cancelled or following
the Senior Discharge Date the Second Secured Liabilities have been repaid in full; or

     - if applicable, any High Yield Standstill Period (as defined below) in effect at the time the
payment Stop Notice was issued has expired and the relevant event of default to which the High
Yield Standstill Period relates has not been cured or waived.

No Stop Notice may be served by the Senior Facility Agent, an Additional Senior Facilities
Representative or any Senior Secured Notes Trustee or Additional Senior Secured Notes Trustee or a
Second Secured Representative (as applicable) in reliance on a particular payment blockage event more
than 75 days after the Senior Facility Agent, each Additional Senior Facilities Representative, a Senior
Secured Notes Trustee, an Additional Senior Secured Notes Trustee or a Second Secured Representative
receives notice in writing specifying the occurrence constituting that payment blockage event. Not more than
one Stop Notice may be served by the Senior Facility Agent, each Senior Secured Notes Trustee or
Additional Senior Secured Notes Trustee or each Second Secured Representative (as applicable) with
respect to the same event or set of circumstances. No Stop Notice in relation to a payment blockage event
may be served unless (i) 365 days have elapsed since the delivery of any previous Stop Notice in relation to a
payment blockage event, and (ii) all scheduled payments of interest on any High Yield Notes that have
become due as a result of any previous Stop Notice have been paid in full in cash.

Any failure to make a payment due under the indenture for any High Yield Notes (the “High Yield
**Notes Indentures”) or the guarantees of any High Yield Notes as a result of the foregoing will not prevent**
the occurrence of an event of default under any High Yield Notes as a consequence of such non-payment or
the commencement of an Enforcement Action otherwise permitted by the Intercreditor Deed.

**_Entitlement to Enforce_**

The Intercreditor Deed provides that the Senior Security Agent will (subject to certain exceptions)
enforce the senior security only at the direction of the Instructing Group. Subject to certain exceptions in
relation to the Second Secured Security (as defined in the Intercreditor Deed), prior to the Senior Discharge
Date, the Second Secured Creditors may only take Enforcement Action with respect to the guarantees or
security granted pursuant to the Intercreditor Deed in respect of the Second Secured Liabilities or any
Second Secured Proceeds Loan if:

     - the prior written consent of the Instructing Group is obtained;


-----

are not adverse to the rights of the other parties or class of parties, which may be made by only IHL and the


-----

party or class of parties affected thereby, or (iv) any amendments are made to give effect to the appointment
of an Additional Senior Facilities Representative in respect of the Additional Senior Finance Parties or a
Second Secured Representative in respect of the Second Secured Creditors, which amendments may be made
by the Senior Security Agent and IHL. Subject to (i) and (ii) in the previous sentence, no amendment or

Trustee, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes Trustee, the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes Trustee, the
2025 Senior Secured Notes Trustee, the Trustee, any Additional Senior Secured Notes Trustee, the Senior

Creditors or any High Yield Notes Trustee and the holders of any High Yield Notes but only to the same
extent and to no greater extent than the amendment, waiver or consent in relation to the relevant Senior

treated in a manner which is different to the other Senior Creditors in which event the consent of the hedge
counterparties shall also be required. No such amendment, waiver or consent will (without prejudice to

any Senior Secured Notes Trustee, any Additional Senior Secured Notes Trustee, the Senior Facility Agent,
each Additional Senior Facilities Representative and the Senior Security Agent are authorized to enter

Notes, the only significant assets of the Issuer will be the Notes Proceeds Loan, the 2028 Senior Secured
Notes Proceeds Loans, the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes Proceeds Loan, the May 2026 Senior Secured
Notes Proceeds Loan, the 2025 Senior Secured Notes Proceeds Loan and the euro-denominated SFA
Proceeds Loans and, as such, the Issuer will be dependent on payments by IHL on such proceeds loans in
order to service its Indebtedness, including the Notes.

As of September 30, 2023, after giving pro forma effect to the issuance, of the Notes and the
application of the proceeds therefrom as described under “Use of Proceeds” and the Transactions, the
Parent would have had total consolidated loans and borrowings of €11,662.7 million.

The Notes will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness and other
obligations of the Issuer that are secured by Liens senior to the Liens securing the Notes or secured by
property and assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing
such Indebtedness and other obligations.

Certain Liens securing the Notes created under German and French law will, as a matter of local
law, be granted as junior ranking Liens in relation to the Liens in respect of the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities, the 2028 Senior Secured Notes, the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior
Secured Notes and the 2025 Senior Secured Notes. Nevertheless, the Intercreditor Deed provides that as a
contractual matter as among Senior Secured Creditors (as defined in the Intercreditor Deed), the Notes will
be secured on a pari passu basis with the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the 2028 Senior Secured Notes,
the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the 2025 Senior Secured Notes,
certain hedging obligations and certain cash management obligations and will be treated as such for
purposes of the application of proceeds from the enforcement of such Collateral. References to firstpriority or first ranking security interests include security interests that were created subsequent in time and
thus subsequent in in rem ranking, but are contractually pari passu with prior ranking security and
entitled to equal treatment with other prior security secured creditors pursuant to the Intercreditor
Agreement.

The existing first-ranking Liens securing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the 2028 Senior
Secured Notes, the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes and the 2025
Senior Secured Notes that were created under New York, Luxembourg and Norwegian law will remain in
place and will extend to secure the Notes. In some jurisdictions, the Security Documents creating the existing
first-ranking Liens securing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the 2028 Senior Secured Notes, the
March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes and the 2025 Senior Secured Notes
will be amended to extend such Liens (or, with respect to Belgian security, to confirm that these Liens
extend) to the Notes (or, with respect to French and certain German security interests, junior ranking security
interests will be granted). The existing first-ranking Liens securing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the
2028 Senior Secured Loans, the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes and
the 2025 Senior Secured Notes that were created under English law, Jersey law, Scottish law and Singapore
law will remain in place, and new Liens over the same Collateral will be created in these jurisdictions to secure
the Notes. In these jurisdictions where new Liens are created, the ranking of these new Liens relative to
the existing Liens will, as a matter of general law, depend on a number of factors, such as the nature of the
Liens, the order of creation of the Liens, compliance with the jurisdiction’s perfection requirements with
respect to the Liens and the order of giving notices with respect to the Liens, and accordingly without the
Intercreditor Deed, the new Liens would be likely to rank after the existing Liens. However, the Intercreditor
Deed provides that, as a contractual matter, the Liens securing the Notes, the 2028 Senior Secured Notes,
the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the 2025 Senior Secured Notes
and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities will rank pari passu and will be treated as having equal priority
with respect to the application of proceeds from the enforcement of any Collateral.


-----

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Deed, the proceeds of any enforcement of the Collateral will
be applied, subject to the rights of creditors mandatorily preferred by law applying to companies generally,
_pro rata to repayment of the Notes, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the 2028 Senior Secured Notes,_
the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the 2025 Senior Secured Notes,
the Hedging Obligations to the extent the relevant counterparties accede to the Intercreditor Deed (the
“Hedging Liabilities”) and the Cash Management Arrangements to the extent the relevant counterparties
accede to the Intercreditor Deed (the “Cash Management Liabilities”). The Intercreditor Deed limits the
ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Notes to instruct the Security Trustee to take enforcement action.
Please see “—Enforcement of Security,” and “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Deed.”

In addition, the Notes will be effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and
other liabilities of the Company’s Subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes.

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Deed will permit the Issuer to issue Indebtedness secured by
Liens on the Collateral securing the Notes, which Liens may, under certain circumstances, rank ahead of
the security interests on the Collateral securing the Notes. Please see “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.”_

**_The Guarantees_**

The Notes will be guaranteed by the Guarantors. Each Guarantee will:

     - be joint and several and will be the general senior obligation of the applicable Guarantor;

    - be secured as set forth below under “—Security;”

     - rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future obligations of the applicable
Guarantor that are not expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantee, including
with respect to the Guarantee of the Notes by each Guarantor, Indebtedness under the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities and the guarantees of the 2028 Senior Secured Notes, the March 2026
Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes and the 2025 Senior Secured Notes, the
guarantees by IGH and IHL under the Rain Facilities, the guarantee by IGH under the Rafnes
Facility, the debt service undertaking by IGH, IHL and INEOS US I Inc. under the Project ONE
Facilities and the guarantees by IGH, IHL and INEOS US I Inc. under the Project ONE
Interim Facilities;

     - rank effectively senior to all existing and future obligations of such Guarantor that are unsecured
or secured by Liens junior to the Liens securing the Guarantees to the extent of the value of
the Collateral; and

     - rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future obligations of the applicable Guarantor
that are expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantee.

The Guarantees will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness and other
obligations of such Guarantor that are secured by Liens senior to the Liens securing such Guarantee or
secured by property and assets that do not secure such Guarantee, to the extent of the value of the property
and assets securing such Indebtedness and other obligations. In the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency,
each such secured lenders will have a prior secured claim to any collateral of such Guarantor securing the debt
owed to them.

Not all of the Company’s Restricted Subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. However, each of the
Company’s Subsidiaries that as of the Issue Date will guarantee the 2028 Senior Secured Notes, the
March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the 2025 Senior Secured Notes and
the Senior Secured Credit Facilities will also guarantee the Notes. As of the Issue Date, the Notes will be
jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Initial Guarantors. See “Risk Factors—
_Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Capital Structure—Post-Closing Guarantees and Collateral—The_
_Subsequent Guarantors will not initially guarantee the Notes and the Subsequent Collateral will not initially_
_secure the Notes.” Each of the Parent, the Company, the Issuer and the other Initial Guarantors shall take_
such necessary actions, and the Company shall cause its Restricted Subsidiaries to take such necessary actions,
so that on the date that is no later than 90 days following the Issue Date, the Subsequent Guarantors shall
become Guarantors by executing and delivering to the Trustee a supplemental indenture substantially in the
form attached as an exhibit to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. The Guarantors (upon the Subsequent
Guarantors becoming Guarantors under the Indenture) are expected to represent 95.9% of the Parent’s
consolidated EBITDA before exceptionals for the 12-month period ended September 30, 2023 and hold


-----

87.1% of the Parent’s consolidated total assets as of September 30, 2023 (in each case, calculated in
accordance with, and in the manner provided by, the guarantor maintenance covenant in the Senior Secured
Term Loans Agreement as in effect on the Issue Date after giving effect to the exclusion of the Consolidated
EBITDA (as defined in the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement) and consolidated total assets of
certain subsidiaries of the Parent (including Unrestricted Subsidiaries), which represent approximately
3.1% of the Parent’s consolidated EBITDA before exceptionals for the same period and hold approximately
14.8% of the Parent’s consolidated total assets as of September 30, 2023). See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Relating to the Notes and Our Capital Structure—Structural Subordination—The Notes and each guarantee_
_will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities and any preferred stock of the non-Guarantor subsidiaries.” On_
the Issue Date, the Company has designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries INEOS Real Estate GmbH &
Co. KG, which owns an office building in Köln, Germany; Gemini HDPE LLC, INEOS Gemini HDPE LLC
and INEOS Gemini HDPE Holding Company LLC, which produce high density polyethylene in La
Porte, Texas, United States; INEOS China Holdings Limited, INEOS China Holdings II Limited, INEOS
China Holdings III Limited, INEOS Tianjin Holdings Limited, INEOS Investment (Tianjin) Company
Limited and INEOS Investment (Shanghai) Company Limited, which include the holder of the 50%
interest in SECCO and the holder of the 50% interest in the Tianjin Nangang Ethylene Project; and INEOS
Nitriles (UK) Limited.

The obligations of the Guarantors under their Guarantees will be limited as necessary to recognize
certain limitations imposed due to local law and defenses generally available to guarantors (including those
that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate
purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors
generally) or other considerations under applicable law. Please see “Description of the Collateral and the
_Guarantees,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Capital Structure—Insolvency laws—_
_Relevant insolvency laws in England, Luxembourg and other jurisdictions may provide you with less protection_
_than U.S. bankruptcy law,” “—Guarantees and Collateral Limitations—The guarantees and pledges of_
_Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject_
_to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability,” and “—Enforcement of French share_
_pledges—Under the security interests governed by French law, you may be required to pay a “soulte” in the_
_event you decide to enforce the pledge of the shares by judicial or contractual foreclosure of the Collateral_
_consisting of shares of INEOS France SAS or INEOS Technologies France SAS rather than by a sale of such_
_Collateral in a public auction” and “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees, the_
_Collateral and Certain Insolvency Considerations.”_

The obligations of any Guarantor under its Guarantee will be automatically and unconditionally
released and discharged in certain circumstances. Please see “Description of Other Indebtedness—
_Intercreditor Deed” and “—Release of the Guarantees.”_

**_Release of the Guarantees_**

The Guarantee provided by any Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released and
terminated, without any action by, or the necessity of the consent of, the Trustee, the Security Trustee or
the holders of the Notes as follows (and each holder of the Notes will be deemed to have irrevocably
authorized the Trustee and the Security Trustee to execute and deliver (and, at the request and cost of the
Company, each of the Trustee and the Security Trustee will execute and deliver) any document to the
extent necessary or reasonably requested by the Company to evidence such release and termination):

concurrent sales, assignments, transfers or other dispositions to the Company, a Guarantor
or a Restricted Subsidiary) to a Person that is not (after giving effect to such transaction
or any related transactions) the Company, a Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary, if such
sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition does not violate the requirements of the
covenant set forth under the heading “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sale of Assets”;

(b) with respect to any Subsidiary Guarantor, in connection with any sale, assignment,
transfer (including any transfer to a Permitted Joint Venture) or other disposition of the
Capital Stock of such Subsidiary Guarantor (or of the Capital Stock of any direct or
indirect parent company of such Subsidiary Guarantor (other than the Parent, any Parent
Intermediate Holdco, the Company or the Issuer)) that results in such Subsidiary

Guarantor ceasing to be a Restricted Subsidiary, if such sale, assignment, transfer or other
disposition does not violate the requirements of the covenant set forth under the heading
“—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sale of Assets”;

(c) with respect to any Subsidiary Guarantor, if such Subsidiary Guarantor is designated as
an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the covenant described under “—Certain

is continuing;

(h) as described in clause (e) in the first paragraph under “—Modifications and Amendments”;

(i) with respect to any Subsidiary Guarantor, upon written notice from the Company to the
Trustee, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; provided that, after
giving effect to such release, the Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Senior Secured
Term Loans Agreement) of the Issuer and the Guarantors is at least 85% of the Consolidated
EBITDA of the Parent, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries and the consolidated
total assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors is at least 85% of the consolidated total
assets of the Parent, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, in each case, calculated
in accordance with, and in the manner provided by and subject to the same exceptions as
those set forth in, Section 7.11(a) of the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement as in
effect on the Issue Date (after giving effect to the modifications included in Exhibit L-1
thereto), including the exclusion of the Consolidated EBITDA and consolidated total assets
of any Project Finance Subsidiary, any Receivables Subsidiary, any Project Finance
Entity or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a special purpose entity, bankruptcy remote
entity, captive insurance company or any not-for-profit entity, INEOS Belgium and its
subsidiaries, to the extent any Rafnes Entity is a Restricted Subsidiary, the Rafnes Entities,
any Restricted Subsidiary organized under the laws of an Excluded Jurisdiction and any
Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary and its subsidiaries,
any cash, cash equivalents and Temporary Cash Investments of the LC Account Parties
(or the effect of the LC Account Parties’ interest income attributable to such cash, cash
equivalents and Temporary Cash Investments securing their liabilities under any LC
Facility), any receivables that are subject to any Permitted Receivables Financing and any
inventory or assets relating thereto that are subject to any inventory financing or similar
arrangement permitted under the Indenture;

(j) with respect to any Guarantor, upon written notice from the Company to the Trustee, as
part of any Permitted Reorganization;

(k) upon the full and final payment of all obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the
Indenture; and

(l) in accordance with the Intercreditor Deed;

_provided, however, that the Company shall have the right, in its sole discretion, by written notice to the_
Trustee delivered prior to the automatic release and termination of any Guarantee as specified above, to
(A) waive such automatic release and termination of such Guarantee and maintain such Guarantee in effect
until such time as the Company shall instruct and direct the Trustee in writing to release and terminate
such Guarantee or (B) elect that the release and termination of such Guarantee shall not occur automatically
as contemplated by this paragraph but shall occur at such other time or times, in such manner and order
and upon the occurrence of such other events as shall be specified by the Company in such notice to the
Trustee; provided further that nothing in this clause (B) shall allow the Company to require the release and


-----

termination of any Guarantee prior to (unless such release and termination is to occur substantially
concurrently with) the occurrence of the applicable event(s) set forth in clauses (a) through (l) above providing
for the release and termination thereof.

In addition, the Intercreditor Deed will provide for the release of certain Guarantees upon an
enforcement sale and as otherwise specified in the Intercreditor Deed. See “Description of Other
_Indebtedness—Intercreditor Deed”. The Indenture will provide that any release of a Guarantee may be_
evidenced, at the Issuer’s option, by the delivery by the Issuer to the Trustee of an Officer’s Certificate of
the Issuer, and the Trustee shall, at the Issuer’s request, acknowledge and confirm receipt of such Officer’s
Certificate.

**_Security_**

The obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the obligations of the Guarantors under the
Guarantees will be secured by, subject to Permitted Collateral Liens, first-ranking Liens over the Collateral
(or, with respect to French and certain German security interests, junior ranking security interests) as
described in “Description of the Collateral and the Guarantees”.

Certain Liens securing the Notes created under German and French law will, as a matter of local
law, be granted as junior ranking Liens in relation to the Liens in respect of the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities, the 2028 Senior Secured Notes, the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior
Secured Notes and the 2025 Senior Secured Notes. Nevertheless, the Intercreditor Deed provides that as a
contractual matter as among Senior Secured Creditors (as defined in the Intercreditor Deed), the Notes will
be secured on a pari passu basis with the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the 2028 Senior Secured Notes,
the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the 2025 Senior Secured Notes,
certain Hedging Obligations and certain Cash Management Arrangements and will be treated as such for
purposes of the application of proceeds from the enforcement of such Collateral. References to first-priority
or first ranking security interests include security interests that were created subsequent in time and thus
subsequent in in rem ranking, but are contractually pari passu with prior ranking security and entitled to
equal treatment with other prior security secured creditors pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement.

The existing first-ranking Liens securing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the 2028 Senior
Secured Notes, the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes and the 2025
Senior Secured Notes that were created under New York, Luxembourg and Norwegian law will remain in
place and will extend to secure the Notes. In some jurisdictions, the Security Documents creating the existing
first-ranking Liens securing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the 2028 Senior Secured Notes, the
March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes and the 2025 Senior Secured Notes
will be amended to extend such Liens (or, with respect to Belgian security, to confirm that these Liens
extend) to the Notes (or, with respect to French and certain German security interests, junior ranking security
interests will be granted). The existing first-ranking Liens securing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the
2028 Senior Secured Notes, the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes and
the 2025 Senior Secured Notes that were created under English law, Jersey law, Scottish law and Singapore
law will remain in place, and new Liens over the same Collateral will be created in these jurisdictions to secure
the Notes. In these jurisdictions where new Liens are created, the ranking of these new Liens relative to
the existing Liens will, as a matter of general law, depend on a number of factors, such as the nature of the
Liens, the order of creation of the Liens, compliance with the jurisdiction’s perfection requirements with
respect to the Liens and the order of giving notices with respect to the Liens, and accordingly without the
Intercreditor Deed, the new Liens would be likely to rank after the existing Liens. However, the Intercreditor
Deed provides that, as a contractual matter, the Liens securing the Notes, the 2028 Senior Secured Notes,
the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the 2025 Senior Secured Notes
and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities will rank pari passu and will be treated as having equal priority
with respect to the application of proceeds from the enforcement of any Collateral.

The Collateral will also secure the obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the
2028 Senior Secured Notes, the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the
2025 Senior Secured Notes, the Hedging Liabilities and the Cash Management Liabilities on a pari passu
basis. The Liens on the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the 2028 Senior Secured
Notes, the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes and the 2025 Senior
Secured Notes are already in place. In some jurisdictions, the Security Documents creating such Liens will
be amended to extend such Liens (or, with respect to Belgian security, to confirm that these Liens extend) to
the Notes (or, with respect to French and certain German security interest, junior ranking security interests
will be granted). The existing first-ranking Liens securing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the 2028


-----

Senior Secured Notes, the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes and the
2025 Senior Secured Notes that were created under New York, Luxembourg and Norwegian law will remain
in place and will extend to secure the Notes. The existing first-ranking Liens securing the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities, the 2028 Senior Secured Notes, the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior
Secured Notes and the 2025 Senior Secured Notes that were created under English law, Jersey law, Scottish
law and Singapore law will remain in place, and new Liens over the same Collateral will be created in
these jurisdictions to secure the Notes. In these jurisdictions where new Liens are created, the ranking of
these new Liens relative to the existing Liens will, as a matter of general law, depend on a number of factors,
such as the nature of the Liens, the order of creation of the Liens, compliance with the jurisdiction’s
perfection requirements with respect to the Liens and the order of giving notices with respect to the Liens,
and accordingly without the Intercreditor Deed, the new Liens would be likely to rank after the existing Liens.
However, the Intercreditor Deed provides that, as a contractual matter, the Liens securing the Notes, the
2028 Senior Secured Notes, the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the
2025 Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities will rank pari passu and will be
treated as having equal priority with respect to the application of proceeds from the enforcement of any
Collateral.

The Collateral is granted pursuant to the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Deed to the
Security Trustee on behalf of the holders of the secured obligations that are secured by the Collateral,
including the Notes. For a description of the Collateral and the Security Documents, see “Description of
_the Collateral and the Guarantees”. For a discussion of the ranking of the Collateral and the application of_
the proceeds thereof, see “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Deed”.

The requirements for the granting of Liens under the Indenture, arising at any time on or after the
Issue Date, will generally be subject to certain security principles described under “—Security Principles”.
In addition, the Liens on the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations and are at all times in all cases
subject to the requirements of applicable law. Please see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and
_Our Capital Structure—Insolvency laws—Relevant insolvency laws in England, Luxembourg and other_
_jurisdictions may provide you with less protection than U.S. bankruptcy law”, “Risk Factors—Risks Relating_
_to the Notes and Our Capital Structure—Guarantees and Collateral limitations—The guarantees and pledges of_
_Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or_
_subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability”, “Risk Factors—Enforcement of_
_French share pledges—Under the security interests governed by French law, you may be required to pay a_
_“soulte” in the event you decide to enforce the pledges of the shares by judicial or contractual foreclosure of the_
_Collateral consisting of shares of INEOS Technologies France SAS and INEOS France SAS rather than by_
_a sale of such Collateral in a public auction” and “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees_
_and the Security Interests”._

A Lien on certain of the Collateral described under “Description of the Collateral and the
_Guarantees—Summary of the Guarantees and Collateral for the Notes” will be granted to secure the_
Obligations under the Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees on the Issue Date (such Collateral, the
“Initial Collateral”), and, to the extent not also granted on the Issue Date, the Issuer and the Guarantors
will be required to grant the other Collateral described under “Description of the Collateral and the
_Guarantees—Summary of the Guarantees and Collateral for the Notes” (such other Collateral, the “Additional_
**Collateral”) no later than 90 days after the Issue Date. The Notes and the related Guarantees will be**
secured by first priority Liens (subject to certain exceptions) on the same assets that secure the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities. Please see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Capital
_Structure—Post-Closing Collateral—The Post-Closing Collateral will not initially secure the Notes”._

The Issuer and each Guarantor shall take such necessary actions and shall cause its respective
Restricted Subsidiaries to take such necessary actions so that Liens over the Collateral in respect of the
Notes shall be granted to the Security Trustee on behalf of, and for the benefit of, the holders of the Notes
pursuant to the Security Documents as contemplated by the Indenture.

The Issuer and each Guarantor shall, and shall procure that each of its respective Subsidiaries
shall, at its own expense, execute and do all such acts and things and provide such assurances as the
Security Trustee may reasonably require (i) for registering any Security Document relating to the Collateral
in any required register and for perfecting or protecting the security intended to be afforded by such
Security Document relating to the Collateral and (ii) if such Security Document has become enforceable in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the relevant Security Document and the Intercreditor Deed,
for facilitating the realization of all or any part of the Collateral which is subject to such Security Document
and for facilitating the exercise of all powers, authorities and discretions vested in the Security Trustee or


-----

in any receiver of all or any part of such Collateral. The Issuer and each Guarantor shall, and shall procure
that each of its respective Subsidiaries shall, execute such transfers, conveyances, assignments and releases
of that property whether to the Security Trustee or to its nominees and give such notices, orders and directions
which the Security Trustee may reasonably request.

**_Security Documents_**

The Notes and the Guarantees will be secured by, subject to Permitted Collateral Liens, firstranking Liens over the Collateral (or, with respect to French and certain German security interests, junior
ranking security interests). Certain of the Liens on the Initial Collateral will be perfected after the Issue Date
and certain of the Liens on the Additional Collateral will be perfected after the date that is 90 days after
the Issue Date, in each case in accordance with applicable law. Please see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to
_the Notes and Our Capital Structure—Perfection of security interests—Your rights in the Collateral may be_
_adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Collateral”. The Collateral will be granted_
pursuant to the Security Documents to the Security Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes.

Certain Liens securing the Notes created under German and French law will, as a matter of local
law, be granted as junior ranking Liens in relation to the Liens in respect of the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities, the 2028 Senior Secured Notes, the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior
Secured Notes and the 2025 Senior Secured Notes. Nevertheless, the Intercreditor Deed provides that as a
contractual matter as among Senior Secured Creditors (as defined in the Intercreditor Deed), the Notes will
be secured on a pari passu basis with the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the 2028 Senior Secured Notes,
the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the 2025 Senior Secured Notes,
certain Hedging Obligations and certain Cash Management Arrangements and will be treated as such for
purposes of the application of proceeds from the enforcement of such Collateral. References to first-priority
or first ranking security interests include security interests that were created subsequent in time and thus
subsequent in in rem ranking, but are contractually pari passu with prior ranking security and entitled to
equal treatment with other prior security secured creditors pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement.

In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and
perfection of security interests in such jurisdictions, the Indenture and/or the Intercreditor Deed will
provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Trustee, and the security
interests in such jurisdictions will secure the parallel debt (and not the Indebtedness under the Notes). The
parallel debt construct has not been tested under law in certain of these jurisdictions. Please see “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Capital Structure—Decisions regarding Collateral—Holders of_
_the Notes will not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral”._

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under
“—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens”,
the Issuer and the Guarantors are permitted to grant Liens on the Collateral in connection with certain future
incurrences of Indebtedness, including any Additional Notes permitted under the Indenture, on terms
consistent with the relative priority of such Indebtedness. In addition, the Indenture and the Intercreditor
Deed also will permit the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries to issue Indebtedness secured by Liens on
the Collateral, which Liens may, under certain circumstances, rank ahead of the Liens on the Collateral
securing the Notes. Please see “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens” and “—Certain Covenants—
_Impairment of Security Interest.”_

Each holder of the Notes, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed (i) to have authorized (a) the
Trustee and the Security Trustee to enter into the Intercreditor Deed and (b) the Security Trustee to enter
into the Security Documents and (ii) in each case, to have agreed to be bound thereby. Each holder of the
Notes, by accepting a Note, appoints the Security Trustee as its agent under the Security Documents and
authorizes it to act as such.

The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Security Documents
(including the terms described under “—Enforcement of Security” and “—Release of Security”), the Notes
and the Indenture, as applicable, will be secured by the Liens on the Collateral until all obligations under the
Notes and the Indenture have been discharged.

In the event that the Issuer, the Parent, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries enters into
insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the Liens securing the Notes created under the Security
Documents could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of such Liens is successful,
the holders of the Notes may not be able to recover any amounts under the Security Documents. Please

**_Security Principles_**

The Indenture will provide that certain requirements for the providing of Guarantees and the
granting and perfecting of Liens in favor of the holders of the Notes and the Trustee will generally be
subject to the Security Principles as set forth in the Indenture. The Security Principles embody recognition
by all parties that there may be certain legal and practical difficulties in obtaining Guarantees or granting or
perfecting Liens. In particular:

(a) Factors that will be considered when determining whether Guarantees or Liens will be
provided or granted, or the extent to which the Guarantees or Liens will be granted or
perfected (including the maximum amount guaranteed or secured), will include general
statutory limitations, financial assistance, capital maintenance, corporate benefit, fraudulent
preference, “thin capitalization” and similar laws, rules and regulations of any applicable
jurisdiction, retention of title claims, employee consultation or approval requirements and
the extent to which the giving or the terms of a Guarantee, the granting of Liens or,
prior to the Liens created under the Security Documents becoming enforceable in accordance
with the Security Documents, the extent of the perfection requirements would materially
and adversely impact the business, or commercial relationships with third parties, of the
Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as applicable, in the ordinary course. Subject to the
Security Principles, if any Guarantee or the amount secured by any Lien is to be limited,
the Guarantee and the Liens provided or granted will extend to the maximum amount that
the Issuer or the applicable Guarantor may provide in accordance with applicable law,
rules, regulations and current and customary market practice in the relevant jurisdiction.
In furtherance of and without limiting the foregoing:

(i) No Guarantee will be required to be provided, and no Lien will be required to be
granted or perfected, if to do so would reasonably be expected to result (or, if
the provision, grant or perfection thereof would not, in and of itself, reasonably
be expected to result in such breach, the applicable Guarantee and the granting or
perfection of the applicable Lien will be limited to the extent consistent with
current and customary market practice in the relevant jurisdiction to the extent
the failure to do so would reasonably be expected to result) in a breach of general
statutory limitations, financial assistance, capital maintenance, corporate
benefit, fraudulent preference, “thin capitalization” or similar laws, rules or
regulations of any applicable jurisdiction, provided that the Company will use
commercially reasonable efforts (A) to assist in demonstrating that adequate
corporate benefit accrues to the Issuer and each relevant Guarantor, as applicable,
(B) to complete any whitewash or similar procedure required under any relevant
financial assistance laws, other than in the case of a Belgian Guarantor, and
(C) otherwise to overcome or mitigate any such limitations through measures
reasonably available to the Issuer and the relevant Guarantors, as applicable.

(ii) Each Guarantee will be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses
generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent
conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, capital
maintenance, corporate benefit or similar laws, rules or regulations or defenses
affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other similar considerations under
applicable law.

(iii) No Guarantee will be required to be provided, and no Lien will be required to be
granted or perfected, if to do so would reasonably be expected (or, if the
provision, grant or perfection thereof would not, in and of itself, reasonably be
expected to result in such conflict or violation, the applicable Guarantee and the


-----

granting or perfection of the applicable Lien will be limited to the extent consistent
with current and customary market practice in the relevant jurisdiction to the
extent the failure to do so would reasonably be expected) (A) to conflict with the
fiduciary duties of directors or officers of the Issuer, the applicable Restricted
Subsidiary or the relevant Guarantor, as applicable, or to give rise to or result in
personal, civil or criminal liability on the part of any director, officer, legal
representative or shareholder of the Issuer, the applicable Restricted Subsidiary or
Guarantor, as applicable (and the Guarantees and Liens will be limited so as to
mitigate any risk of any of the foregoing) or (B) to give rise to or result in any
violation of applicable law, rule or regulation that, in each case, cannot be avoided
or otherwise prevented through measures reasonably available to the Company
or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary.

(b) The Guarantees and the Liens and the extent of their perfection (and the extent of legal
opinions, title insurance, surveys or other deliverables or formalities in connection therewith)
will take into account the cost (which term, for purposes of the Security Principles, shall
include internal costs and the scope of business disruption and administrative burden) to the
Financial Group of providing the Guarantees or granting, perfecting or maintaining the
Liens (or providing or taking such deliverables or formalities), as applicable, which shall not
be disproportionate relative to the benefit accruing to the holders of the Notes (taking
into account, without limitation, the extent of the obligations that can be guaranteed or
secured and the priority that will be achieved thereby). In furtherance of and without
limiting the foregoing:

(i) No Guarantee will be required to be provided, and no Lien will be required to be
granted or perfected (and no deliverables or other formalities in connection
therewith will be required to be provided or taken), if or to the extent to do so
would reasonably be expected to result in any cost, expense, liability or obligation
(including with respect of any Taxes) which is disproportionate relative to the
benefit accruing to the holders of the Notes (taking into account, without
limitation, the extent of the obligations that can be secured and the priority that
will be achieved thereby) (it being understood and agreed that the cost of providing
a Guarantee or granting, perfecting or maintaining a Lien shall in any event be
deemed to be so disproportionate (and such Guarantee or Lien, as the case may be,
shall not be required to be provided or perfected) if such cost shall exceed the
realizable value of such Guarantee or Lien, as the case may be). Without limiting
the foregoing, the parties expressly acknowledge that no Liens will be required in
respect of real property located in France and owned by the Issuer or any
Guarantor.

(ii) Where there is a material incremental cost involved in creating Liens over all or
any particular assets owned by the Issuer or a Guarantor, the Liens to be taken and
the extent of their perfection will take into account the cost to the Financial
Group in doing so, which shall not be disproportionate relative to the benefit
accruing to the holders of the Notes (taking into account, without limitation, the
extent of the obligations that can be secured and the priority that will be achieved
thereby).

(iii) Where a class of assets to be subject to a Lien includes material and immaterial
assets (including real property), if the cost of granting or perfecting Liens over the
immaterial assets is disproportionate relative to the benefit of such Liens accruing
to the holders of the Notes (taking into account, without limitation, the extent
of the obligations that can be secured and the priority that will be achieved thereby),
Liens will be granted over the material assets only.

(iv) The maximum amount guaranteed or secured may be limited in a manner
consistent with current and customary market practice in the relevant jurisdiction
to minimize stamp duty, notarization, registration or other applicable fees,
Taxes and duties, in each case, where the level of such costs, fees, Taxes and duties
is disproportionate relative to the benefit to the holders of the Notes of increasing
the guaranteed or secured amount (taking into account, without limitation, the


-----

extent of the obligations that can be guaranteed or secured and the priority that
will be achieved thereby).

(c) No Guarantee or Liens will be required to be provided by (i) any Unrestricted Subsidiary,
(ii) any LC Account Party, (iii) any Receivables Subsidiary or any other special purpose
entity or bankruptcy remote entity, (iv) any captive insurance company, (v) any not-forprofit Restricted Subsidiary, (vi) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Wholly Owned
Restricted Subsidiary, (vii) any Project Finance Subsidiary or any Project Finance Entity,
(viii) any Restricted Subsidiary organized under the laws of an Excluded Jurisdiction,
(ix) any of INEOS Belgium and its Subsidiaries, (x) any Rafnes Entity and (xi) any Person
that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary after the Issue Date and that is prohibited by any
contractual obligation, or the Guarantee by which would require any approval or consent
of any third party, in each case which prohibition or requirement is permitted by the
Indenture and is in existence at the time such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary (so
long as such prohibition or requirement is not created in contemplation of or in connection
with such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary).

(d) [Reserved]

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Notes Documents:

(i) no Lien will be required to be granted or perfected (in each case only for as long
as, and to the extent that, such circumstances exist) over any assets (other than
Capital Stock in Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiaries) subject to third-party
arrangements that are not prohibited by the Indenture and that prohibit or restrict
(including if the grant of a Lien created under the Notes Documents would
constitute a breach or default under, result in the termination of, or give rise to a
right on the part of any party thereto to terminate or materially modify, any contract
or agreement governing such arrangement) those assets from being subject to
such Lien created under the Notes Documents and, without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, no Lien will be required to be granted or perfected (in each
case only as long as, and to the extent that such circumstances exist):

(A) in respect of any asset owned or acquired by the Issuer or any Guarantor
that is subject to a Lien securing a purchase money, project financing,
capital or finance lease obligation or Acquired Indebtedness permitted to
be incurred pursuant to the Indenture (or a refinancing of any of the
foregoing) if the contract or other agreement in which such security
interest is granted (or the documentation providing for such purchase
money, project financing, capital or finance lease obligation or Acquired
Indebtedness or such refinancing) prohibits or restricts the creation of
any other Lien on such assets (including if the grant of any other Lien
would constitute a breach or default under, result in the termination of, or
give rise to a right on the part of any party thereto to terminate or
materially modify, such contract or agreement or such documentation);

(B) in the case of any Capital Stock of any Person that is not a Wholly
Owned Restricted Subsidiary (including any Permitted Joint Venture), if
such Lien is prohibited or restricted (including if the grant of a Lien created
under the Notes Documents would constitute a breach or default under,
result in the termination of, or give rise to a right on the part of any party
thereto to terminate or materially modify, any such document, contract
or other agreement) by any organizational or governance documents of
such Person, any applicable shareholder or similar agreement or any
contract or other agreement governing Indebtedness of such Person; or

(C) with respect to any bank or securities accounts, or assets credited thereto,
and any cash, cash equivalents or Temporary Cash Investments that, in
each case, are subject to Permitted Liens securing any LC Facility, any
bids, trade contracts, leases, performance, surety, appeal or tax bonds or
similar instruments or any other obligations incurred in the ordinary
course of business (other than any Indebtedness for borrowed money);


-----

(ii) no Lien will be required to be granted or perfected (in each case only for as long
as, and to the extent that, such circumstances exist) with respect to any Receivables
Assets, or any Capital Stock in or assets of any Receivables Subsidiary, that are
subject to Permitted Liens securing obligations in connection with any Permitted
Receivables Financing;

(iii) no Lien will be required to be granted or perfected over any asset to the extent
that, and only for so long as, the creation of such Lien under the Notes Documents
over such asset (A) is prohibited or restricted by applicable law, rule or regulation
or (B) requires a consent not obtained from any Governmental Authority
pursuant to applicable law, rule or regulation; provided that the Issuer or the
relevant Guarantor, as applicable, shall use commercially reasonable efforts, to the
extent consistent with current and customary market practice in the relevant
jurisdiction, to overcome any such obstacle or obtain such consent;

(iv) no Lien will be required to be granted or perfected over any (A) bank or securities
accounts, and assets credited thereto, used solely to hold funds in trust for any
director, officer or employee of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any employee
benefit plan maintained by the Parent or any of the Subsidiaries, (B) bank or
securities accounts, and assets credited thereto, the funds in which consist solely
of cash earnest money deposits, deposits to defease or to satisfy and discharge any
Indebtedness or deposits under escrow or similar arrangements not prohibited
under the Indenture or that represent Escrowed Proceeds, (C) bank or securities
accounts, and assets credited thereto, that constitute trust or fiduciary accounts
and (D) bank accounts used solely for collections of receivables under any Permitted
Receivables Financing;

(v) no Lien will be required to be granted or perfected over any Intellectual Property,
lease, license or other agreement to the extent that a grant of a security interest
therein is prohibited or restricted under such Intellectual Property, lease, license or
other agreement (including if the grant of such Lien would constitute a breach
or default under, result in the termination of, or give rise to a right on the part of
any party thereto to terminate or materially modify, such Intellectual Property, lease,
license or other agreement), in each case except to the extent such prohibition or
restriction is rendered ineffective pursuant to applicable law (including, where
applicable, Sections 9-406, 9-407, 9-408 or 9-409 of the Uniform Commercial Code
as in effect in the State of New York) or principles of equity;

(vi) no Lien will be required to be granted or perfected over any Capital Stock of any
Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(vii) with respect to any U.S. Obligor, no Lien will be required to be granted or
perfected over any intent-to-use trademark application prior to the filing of a
“Statement of Use” or “Amendment to Allege Use” with respect thereto, to the
extent that the grant of a security interest therein would impair the validity or
enforceability of such intent-to-use trademark application under applicable United
States Federal law;

(viii) [Reserved];

(ix) no Lien will be required to be granted or perfected over any Excluded Buildings;
and

(x) no Lien will be required to be granted or perfected over any Capital Stock in any
Project Finance Entity or Project Finance Subsidiary;

in each case other than any proceeds of the foregoing (unless such proceeds
would constitute assets described in clauses (i) through (x) above or would
otherwise be excluded from Collateral pursuant to the Security Principles) (the
foregoing being collectively referred to as the “Excluded Property”).

(f) Except where such Liens may be created pursuant to a floating charge or other similar allasset security (including, in the case of clause (ii) below, a German law global assignment


-----

agreement and, in the case of clause (iii) below, a German law security transfer agreement
covering a defined security area (Raumsicherungsubereignung)), no Lien will be required
to be granted and, except where such Lien may be perfected by filing of a financing statement
under the Uniform Commercial Code (or a similar unitary filing in any relevant
jurisdiction) with respect to the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as applicable, no Lien
will be required to be perfected over:

(i) any Capital Stock owned by the Issuer or any Guarantor in any Restricted
Subsidiary that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor;

(ii) (A) any intercompany advance, balance or loan in a principal amount of €200,000
or less and (B) any intercompany advance, balance or loan that is due or to be
repaid or otherwise discharged within 30 days of the making thereof;

(iii) any trucks, trailers, tractors, service vehicles, automobiles, rolling stock or other
registered mobile equipment or equipment covered by certificates of title or
ownership (or the equivalent thereof in any relevant jurisdiction);

(iv) any Intellectual Property that is not material to the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries or, with respect to any Intellectual Property that is so material, (A) with
respect to the granting of such Lien, other than in the jurisdiction of organization
of the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as applicable, or the United States and
(B) with respect to the perfection of such Lien, other than in the United Kingdom,
the United States, at the European Community level or the jurisdiction of the
law governing the granting of such Lien;

(v) any right or interest in, to or under any Interest Rate Agreement, Currency
Hedging Agreement or Commodity Price Protection Agreement;

(vi) any right or interest in, to or under any insurance policy, other than property
damage, business interruption, marine cargo insurance and, to the extent
constituting property damage insurance, contractors all-risk insurance policies;

(vii) any right or interest in, to or under any insurance policy that is not material to the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries;

(viii) (A) bank or securities accounts, and assets credited thereto, used primarily for
payroll, payroll taxes, other employee wage and benefit payments and VAT and
other taxes, (B) disbursement accounts, (C) bank or securities accounts, and assets
credited thereto, that are part of a cash pooling arrangement of the Restricted
Group, so long as the assets credited thereto are transferred, on a regular basis, to
one or more accounts that are either subject to a valid Lien under the Security
Documents or that are not required to be subject to such Lien in accordance with
the Security Principles and (D) any other bank or securities accounts (which are
not subject to a valid Lien under the Security Documents) held at any one or more
banks or securities intermediaries, provided, in the case of this clause (D), that
the aggregate amount held in such accounts by the Issuer and the Guarantors does
not exceed €100,000,000 (or its equivalent in any other currency) at any time (the
“Cash Limit”), provided further that should the Cash Limit be exceeded at any time,
then such excess shall reasonably promptly be transferred to a bank or securities
account that is subject to a valid Lien under the Security Documents;

(ix) any owned real property that is not a Material Real Property and any real
property leasehold interest; and

(x) with respect to any U.S. Obligor, any commercial tort claim as to which the
applicable U.S. Obligor has determined that it reasonably expects to recover less
than €20,000,000 (or its equivalent in any other currency) or any letter of credit
rights (other than letter of credit rights constituting supporting obligations).

(g) Perfection of Liens, when required, and other legal formalities will be completed (i) within
the time periods specified therefor in the applicable Notes Documents (subject to any
extensions thereof where the Company, acting reasonably, determines that such action
cannot be accomplished without undue effort or expense by the time or times at which it


-----

would otherwise be required to be accomplished by the Indenture, the Security Documents
or any other Notes Document) or (ii) if not so specified, as soon as practicable but
within the time periods specified by applicable law.

(h) Subject in each case to the Security Principles, each Guarantee will be an upstream, crossstream and downstream guarantee and, to the extent legally possible, the Issuer and
each Guarantor shall create first-ranking Liens over all assets of the Issuer or such
Guarantor that are material, and each Guarantee and Lien will be for all obligations of
the Issuer or such Guarantor under the Notes and the Indenture, as applicable, in accordance
with, and subject to, the requirements of each relevant jurisdiction.

(i) Where the Issuer or a Guarantor pledges specific Capital Stock or a specific bank
account, the Security Document will be governed by the law of the country of organization
of the Person whose Capital Stock is being pledged or the law of the country in which
such bank account is located to the extent necessary to ensure the perfection of such pledge.

(j) Where the Issuer or a Guarantor acquires assets of material value and/or significance after
the date on which it initially grants Liens under the Security Documents, the Issuer or
such Guarantor, as applicable, shall grant the Liens in accordance with the Security
Principles in respect of such assets if they are of a type over which, if owned on the Issue
Date, Liens would have been created in accordance with the Security Principles and to the
extent that such assets are not subject to the existing Liens created by the Issuer or such
Guarantor, as applicable.

(k) No perfection action will be required with respect to the Issuer or any Guarantor in
jurisdictions other than the jurisdiction of organization of the Issuer or such Guarantor,
as applicable, or the jurisdiction of the law governing the creation of the relevant Lien, other
than in respect of Intellectual Property as set forth in clause (f)(iv) of this paragraph and
except that perfection action may be required in the jurisdiction of organization of one
Guarantor or the Issuer in relation to Liens granted by another Guarantor or the Issuer
organized in a different jurisdiction.

(l) Neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor will be required to take any action with respect to
any Guarantee or any Lien created under the Notes Documents as a result of any
assignment, transfer or participation by any holder of the Notes.

(m) In the case of any Person that becomes a Guarantor after the Issue Date, the application
of the Security Principles to such Guarantor will be made in a manner that is no less
favorable to such new Guarantor than the application thereof is to any then-existing
Guarantor that is organized in the same jurisdiction as such new Guarantor (or, in the case
of a new Guarantor that is organized in a different jurisdiction than any then-existing
Guarantor, in a manner that is no less favorable to such new Guarantor than the application
thereof to the Guarantor on the Issue Date).

The following principles will be reflected in the Security Documents:

(a) The Liens will be first ranking, to the extent possible and subject to Permitted Liens and
the Security Principles.

(b) All Liens will be created (including, where necessary, pursuant to any “parallel debt”
provisions or similar) in favor of, and be enforceable solely by, the Security Trustee
(including at the request or direction of the Trustee), and not by holders of the Notes
individually, in each case, except to the extent otherwise required under applicable law or
current and customary market practice in the relevant jurisdiction.

(c) Except where it is inappropriate under applicable law, Liens will not be enforceable and
will not crystallize until notice of intention to enforce has been given by the Security Trustee
following the occurrence of an Event of Default that is continuing.

(d) Subject to the limitations set forth in clause (p) of this paragraph or elsewhere in the
Security Principles, prior to the giving by the Security Trustee of a notice of intention to
enforce its Liens following the occurrence of an Event of Default that is continuing, the
Issuer and each Guarantor shall, subject to any restrictions required as a matter of law, or
otherwise consistent with current and customary market practice in the relevant


-----

jurisdiction, (i) remain in possession and retain exclusive control over the Collateral
(including, in the case of any bank or securities accounts, the right to withdraw or otherwise
transfer any assets credited thereto and to close such account) and retain the right to
collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom and (ii) otherwise be free to deal with
assets and properties subject to the Liens (including by permitting any Intellectual Property
that is not material to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries to lapse or expire or
adjusting or compromising any receivable), and exercise any voting rights related thereto.

(e) Prior to the giving by the Security Trustee of a notice of intention to enforce its Liens
following the occurrence of an Event of Default that is continuing, (i) no notice of any
Lien over trade receivables, Intellectual Property, lease, license or other agreement or any
insurance policy shall be required to be given to any debtor, counterparty or insurer, as the
case may be, in each case, unless the giving of such notice would be consistent with
current and customary market practice in the relevant jurisdiction, and the Issuer or the
relevant Guarantor, as applicable, shall remain entitled to collect any payments thereunder,
and (ii) no proceeds of any trade receivables shall be required to be paid into any blocked
bank account.

(f) (i) Prior to the giving by the Security Trustee of a notice of intention to enforce its Liens
following the occurrence of an Event of Default that is continuing, the Issuer and the
Guarantors shall be entitled to collect (and, if requested by the applicable insurer, the
Security Trustee shall confirm to such insurer the authority of the Issuer or the relevant
Guarantor, as applicable, to collect) any payments under insurance policies constituting
Collateral and (ii) no loss payee or other endorsement will be made on any insurance policy
and neither the Security Trustee, the Trustee nor any holder of Notes will be named as coinsured.

(g) To the extent such actions are consistent with current and customary market practice in
the relevant jurisdiction, the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as applicable, will be required
to provide customary notices of a Lien over its bank accounts to the applicable bank and
to use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain customary acknowledgements from the
applicable banks (it being agreed, subject to any other provision of the Security Principles,
that (i) while such notice may request a waiver of any Liens, rights of set-off or other
rights that such bank may have, neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor shall be required to
procure any such waiver, (ii) neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor shall be required to close
any bank account in respect of which the applicable bank fails to provide any such
acknowledgements and (iii) neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor shall be required to
change its banking arrangements or standard terms and conditions in connection with the
granting of bank account security). No control agreements will be required in respect of
any deposit, securities or commodities account located in the United States or Canada.

(h) Neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor shall be required to obtain any collateral access
agreements, landlord waivers, warehouse agreements or any similar agreements.

(i) No Liens will be taken over parts, inventory, moveable plant, equipment or receivables to
the extent that the creation or perfection of such Lien requires labelling, segregation or
periodic listing, filing, notification or specification of such parts, inventory, moveable
plant, equipment or receivable. Subject to the foregoing, where, under applicable local law,
supplemental pledges or notices are required in respect of future acquired assets in order
to create or perfect a Lien over such class of assets, such supplemental pledges or notices will
be provided only upon request of the Security Trustee and, in any event, unless an Event
of Default shall have occurred and is continuing, no more frequently than once in any
calendar year.

(j) Subject to the Security Principles, to the extent practicable and consistent with the current
and customary market practice and applicable law in the relevant jurisdiction, Liens
created under the Security Documents will automatically create security over future assets
of the same type as those already subject thereto.

(k) The Security Documents will expressly provide that the proceeds of enforcement of any
Liens granted thereunder will be applied in the manner set forth in the Intercreditor Deed.


-----

(l) Representations and covenants and undertakings in the Security Documents shall be
strictly limited to those necessary for the creation, perfection or maintenance of the security
and shall not be included to the extent that the subject matter thereof is the same as the
corresponding covenant or undertaking in the Indenture; provided that representations
(which, if included, will in any event be given only as of the date of the relevant Security
Document), covenants and undertakings may be included to the extent consistent with
applicable law and current and customary practice in the relevant jurisdiction, in which
event such representation, covenant and undertaking shall be on the same terms as the
corresponding provisions in the Indenture and, for the avoidance of doubt, in any event,
shall not restrict any action or transaction that is permitted or not restricted by the
Indenture or require any additional consents, authorizations or approvals.

(m) Without prejudice to, or the limiting of, the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors
as set forth in the definition of Excluded Property, to the extent and for so long as any asset
constitutes an Excluded Property, neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor shall have any
obligation in respect of such Excluded Property under any “further assurances” or similar
covenants or undertakings set forth in the Security Documents.

(n) The Security Documents shall not contain any rights of set-off, expense reimbursement or
indemnity provisions, provided that the Security Documents may include such provisions
to the extent consistent with applicable law and current and customary practice in the
relevant jurisdiction, in which event such provisions shall be in the form no less favorable
to the Issuer and the Guarantors than the terms of the corresponding provisions in the
Indenture.

(o) Each Security Document shall expressly provide that (i) in the event of any conflict or
inconsistency between such Security Document and the Intercreditor Deed, the Intercreditor
Deed will control and (ii) nothing in such Security Document (A) shall restrict any
action, transaction or other matter that is permitted or not restricted under the Finance
Documents (as defined in the Intercreditor Deed) secured thereby (for the avoidance of
doubt, excluding such Security Document) or (B) shall require any additional notices or
consents with respect to any such action, transaction or other matter (it being understood
that nothing in this clause (B) shall affect any such notices or consents required under such
applicable Finance Documents); provided that clause (ii) shall not apply to the extent that
its application would adversely affect the validity, ranking, priority or enforceability of the
security interest(s) created under such Security Document (other than any such security
interests that, in accordance with the Security Principles, would not have been required to
be created).

(p) In respect of pledges of Capital Stock, the customary limitations on the exercise of voting
rights attaching to any Capital Stock pledged by any pledgor and on the right to receive
and retain dividends or other distributions on any Capital Stock pledged by them, in each
case, to the extent these purport to protect the validity and enforceability of the Liens
over such Capital Stock shall apply. In addition, until notice of intention to enforce has
been given by the Security Trustee following the occurrence of an Event of Default which
is continuing, the pledgors will be permitted to retain and to exercise voting rights
attaching to any Capital Stock pledged by them and to receive and retain dividends or
other distributions on any Capital Stock pledged by them, in each case, in a manner that
does not adversely affect the validity or enforceability of the Liens or cause an Event of
Default to occur and the pledgors will be permitted to pay dividends or other distributions
upstream on pledged Capital Stock to the extent permitted by the Indenture.

(q) The Security Trustee and the Trustee shall only be able to exercise a power of attorney
granted to it following the occurrence of an Event of Default that is continuing or if the
Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as applicable, has failed to comply with a further assurance
or perfection obligation (after the passage of any applicable grace period).

(r) Any security interest created for the benefit of any Second Secured Creditor (as defined in
the Intercreditor Deed) pursuant to any Security Document governed by the laws of the
United States, any State thereof or the District of Columbia must be created as a separate
and distinct junior Lien from any security interest granted for the benefit of any Priority
Creditor (as defined in the Intercreditor Deed).


-----

Notwithstanding the provisions of the Security Principles that would result in such Guarantees or
such Liens not being required (but subject to the other provisions hereof), (a) each Parent Intermediate
Holdco shall be required to provide a Guarantee and (b) the Parent and each Parent Intermediate Holdco
shall be required to grant a Lien over the Capital Stock of each Parent Intermediate Holdco and the Company.

Subject to the Security Principles, the Issuer and the Guarantors will be responsible for payment of
all registration costs, disbursements, taxes, notary fees and other costs (including the reimbursement for
fees, disbursements and other charges by counsel to the Security Trustee) incurred in implementing the
Guarantee and security package agreed upon in accordance with the Security Principles (including any of the
foregoing arising in connection with a resignation of an existing Security Trustee and an appointment of a
new Security Trustee), it being understood and agreed that, consistent with clause (l) of the first paragraph
above, neither the Issuer nor Guarantor shall be responsible for payment of any registration costs,
disbursements, taxes, notary fees or other costs arising as a result of any assignment, transfer or participation
by any holder of the Notes or in case of voluntary registration in Luxembourg with the Administration de
_l’enregistrement, des domaines et de la TVA of any of the Security Documents or of the Intercreditor Deed by_
a holder of Notes or the Security Trustee where such registration, submission or filing is or was not
required to maintain, preserve, establish or enforce the rights of such holder of Notes or of the Security
Trustee under any Security Document or the Intercreditor Deed.

Extensions of time for the creation and perfection of security interests in, or the obtaining of title
insurance, legal opinions, surveys or other deliverables or formalities with respect to, particular properties
or assets or the provision of any Guarantee by any Restricted Subsidiary (including extensions in connection
with assets acquired, or Restricted Subsidiaries formed or acquired, after the Issue Date) may apply where
the Company, acting reasonably, determines that such action cannot be accomplished without undue effort or
expense by the time or times at which it would otherwise be required to be accomplished by the Indenture,
the Security Documents or any other Notes Document.

Exceptions to any requirement to create or perfect security interests in, or to obtain title insurance,
legal opinions, surveys or other deliverables or formalities with respect to, particular properties or assets or
to provide any Guarantee by any Restricted Subsidiary (including exceptions in connection with assets
acquired, or Restricted Subsidiaries formed or acquired, after the Issue Date) may apply where the
Company, acting reasonably, determines that any such security interests or Guarantees would, under the
Indenture and the other Notes Documents, be required or permitted to be released and discharged reasonably
promptly after the creation, perfection or provision thereof.

The application of the Security Principles will be by the Company, acting reasonably and in a
manner which is consistent with current market practice at the time.

Each of the Trustee and the Security Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on an Officer’s
Certificate of the Company delivered to it in connection with the Security Principles as to any matter of
fact or any determination to be made under the Security Principles.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, amendments, supplements and other modifications to the Security
Documents contemplated by the Indenture shall be permitted as so contemplated.

**_Enforcement of Security_**

The Security Documents generally will only become enforceable after the Security Trustee gives
notice of an intention to enforce following the occurrence of an event of default under the Senior Secured
Term Loans, an event of default under the 2028 Senior Secured Notes Indenture, an event of default under
the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes Indenture, an event of default under the May 2026 Senior Secured
Notes Indenture, an event of default under the 2025 Senior Secured Notes Indenture, an Event of Default
under the Indenture or an event of default (or similar event, however described) under other Senior Secured
Indebtedness which is subject to the Intercreditor Deed. The Security Trustee will only be permitted to
enforce the Security Documents in accordance with instructions permitted to be given under the Intercreditor
Deed and each relevant Security Document.

The Intercreditor Deed restricts the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Notes to instruct
the Security Trustee to take enforcement action, and the Security Trustee will act only at the direction of
creditors holding a simple majority in aggregate principal amount of committed or funded debt under the
Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the 2028 Senior Secured Notes, the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the
May 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the 2025 Senior Secured Notes, the Notes, any Additional Notes and
any other Senior Secured Indebtedness incurred in the future will be able to instruct the Security Trustee to


-----

enforce the security. For a description of security enforcement and other intercreditor provisions, please see
“Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Deed”.

**_Priority_**

The relative priority among (a) the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, (b) the
Trustee and the holders of the Notes, (c) the trustee under the 2028 Senior Secured Notes Indenture and
the holders of the 2028 Senior Secured Notes, (d) the trustee under the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes
Indenture and the holders of the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, (e) the trustee under the May 2026 Senior
Secured Notes Indenture and the holders of the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes, (f) the trustee under the
2025 Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the holders of the 2025 Senior Secured Notes, (g) the Hedge
Counterparties to the extent that they are owed Hedging Liabilities and (h) the Cash Management Banks to
the extent they are owed Cash Management Liabilities with respect to the Liens on the Collateral that are
created by the Security Documents and secure obligations under the Notes or the Guarantees and the
Indenture, will be established by the terms of the Intercreditor Deed and the Security Documents, which
will provide that the obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the 2028 Senior Secured Notes,
the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the 2025 Senior Secured Notes,
the Hedging Liabilities, the Cash Management Liabilities and the Notes are secured equally and ratably
by, subject to Permitted Collateral Liens, a first priority interest in the Collateral (or, with respect to French
and certain German security interests, junior ranking security interests).

Certain Liens securing the Notes created under German and French law will, as a matter of local
law, be granted as junior ranking Liens in relation to the Liens in respect of the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities. Nevertheless, the Intercreditor Deed provides that as a contractual matter as among Senior Secured
Creditors (as defined in the Intercreditor Deed), the Notes will be secured on a pari passu basis with the
Senior Secured Credit Facilities, certain hedging obligations and certain cash management obligations and
will be treated as such for purposes of the application of proceeds from the enforcement of such Collateral.

The existing first-ranking Liens securing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the 2028 Senior
Secured Notes, the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes and the 2025
Senior Secured Notes that were created under New York, Luxembourg and Norwegian law will remain in
place and will extend to secure the Notes. In some jurisdictions, the Security Documents creating the existing
first-ranking Liens securing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the 2028 Senior Secured Notes, the
March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes and the 2025 Senior Secured Notes
will be amended to extend such Liens (or, with respect to Belgian security, to confirm that these Liens
extend) to the Notes (or, with respect to French and certain German security interests, junior ranking security
interests will be granted). The existing first-ranking Liens securing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the
2028 Senior Secured Notes, the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes and
the 2025 Senior Secured Notes that were created under English law, Jersey law, Scottish law and Singapore
law will remain in place, and new Liens over the same Collateral will be created in these jurisdictions to secure
the Notes. In these jurisdictions where new Liens are created, the ranking of these new Liens relative to
the existing Liens will, as a matter of general law, depend on a number of factors, such as the nature of the
Liens, the order of creation of the Liens, compliance with the jurisdiction’s perfection requirements with
respect to the Liens and the order of giving notices with respect to the Liens, and accordingly without the
Intercreditor Deed, the new Liens would be likely to rank after the existing Liens. However, the Intercreditor
Deed provides that, as a contractual matter, the Liens securing the Notes, the 2028 Senior Secured Notes,
the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the 2025 Senior Secured Notes
and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities will rank pari passu and will be treated as having equal priority
with respect to the application of proceeds from the enforcement of any Collateral.

**_Release of Security_**

The Liens on the Collateral will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged,
without any action by, or the necessity of the consent of, the Trustee, the Security Trustee or the holders of
the Notes, as follows (and each holder of the Notes will be deemed to have irrevocably authorized the Trustee
and the Security Trustee to execute and deliver (and, at the request and cost of the Issuer, each of the
Trustee and the Security Trustee will execute and deliver) any document to the extent necessary or reasonably
requested by the Issuer to evidence such release and discharge):

(a) in connection with any sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition of such Collateral
(other than Capital Stock in the Company) to a Person that is not the Parent, a Parent
Intermediate Holdco, the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary or, subject to the


-----

requirements of clause (iv) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under
“—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest”, to any other Person that is not
the Issuer or a Guarantor, in each case, if such sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition
does not violate the requirements of the covenant set forth under “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Sale of Assets” or is otherwise permitted by the Indenture;_

(b) if such Collateral is an asset of any Guarantor (other than the Parent, any Parent
Intermediate Holdco or the Company) or any of its Subsidiaries, in connection with any
sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition of Capital Stock of such Guarantor or such
Subsidiary (or of the Capital Stock of any direct or indirect parent company of such
Guarantor or such Subsidiary, in each case, other than the Parent, any Parent Intermediate
Holdco, the Company or the Issuer) as a result of which such Guarantor or such
Subsidiary shall cease to be a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company, if such sale,
assignment, transfer or other disposition does not violate the requirements of the covenant
set forth under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sale of Assets” or is otherwise
permitted by the Indenture;

(c) in the case of any Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee pursuant to the terms of
the Indenture, any Security Document or the Intercreditor Deed or any additional
intercreditor agreement (which release shall be of the Liens on the property and assets,
and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor);

(d) in connection with any Permitted Receivables Financing (which release shall be of the
Liens on the Receivables Assets transferred in connection therewith);

(e) in connection with any inventory financing or similar arrangement incurred pursuant to
clause (22) of the definition of Permitted Indebtedness (which release shall be of the Liens
on the inventory and related assets transferred in connection therewith);

(f) if the Company designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in
accordance with “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Unrestricted Subsidiaries” (which
release shall be of the Liens on the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such
Restricted Subsidiary);

(g) with respect to the Collateral, upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction
and discharge of the Indenture as provided below under the captions “—Defeasance or
_Covenant Defeasance of Indenture” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;_

(h) as described under “—Modifications and Amendments” and “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Liens”;_

(i) if the Lien granted in favor of each of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the 2028 Senior
Secured Notes, the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured
Notes and the 2025 Senior Secured Notes is released (only to the extent that there is no
other Indebtedness secured by a Lien on the assets constituting such Collateral that would
result in the requirement for the Notes and/or the Guarantees to be secured on such
property or assets pursuant to the covenant described under the caption “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Liens”, it being understood that the foregoing limitation will_
not be applicable to the extent that such Indebtedness is secured by a Permitted Lien,
_provided that, for the purposes of this provision only, clauses (a) and (bb) of the definition_
of “Permitted Liens” shall not apply and clause (hh) of the definition of “Permitted
Liens” shall not apply to any Indebtedness that was outstanding on the Issue Date);

(j) in accordance with the Intercreditor Deed;

(k) in the case of any Collateral (other than any Capital Stock in the Company), upon written
notice by the Company to the Trustee and the Security Trustee if such Collateral is
intended to secure (A) Indebtedness incurred under Capital Lease Obligations or Purchase
Money Obligations or other Indebtedness of the Parent, any Parent Intermediate
Holdco, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary incurred for the purpose of financing
all or any part of the acquisition, development, construction or improvement of real or
personal, movable or immovable, property or assets (including Capital Stock) used or to
be used in the business of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, or any refinancing


-----

of any such Indebtedness, or (B) Indebtedness incurred under lines of credit, bilateral
facilities, working capital or overdraft facilities or other operating facilities permitted to be
incurred by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Indebtedness”; provided that the Fair Market Value of all the Collateral released since the_
Issue Date from Liens under this clause (k) (excluding any portion thereof to the extent
Liens thereon are subsequently granted in favor of the Security Trustee, for the benefit
of the holders of the Notes, and with the Fair Market Value of any Collateral being
measured at the time of the release and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value)
does not exceed the greater of (x) €50.0 million and (y) 0.25% of Total Assets in the
aggregate;

(l) in the case of any Escrowed Proceeds, in accordance with the release provisions set forth in
the applicable Security Documents creating Liens thereon;

(m) with respect to Liens on any Proceeds Loan, upon the payment in full or other discharge
of such Proceeds Loan (including as a result of any merger or consolidation of the payor or
the payee thereunder);

(n) to release and/or re-take any Lien on any Collateral to the extent otherwise permitted by
the terms of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Deed or any
additional intercreditor agreement;

(o) to the extent set forth in “—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets”, in connection with
any merger, consolidation, amalgamation, sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer or
other disposition made in compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets”;_

(p) in accordance with “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interests”;

(q) with respect to all Collateral, upon the full and final payment and performance of all
obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture;

(r) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization;

(s) in connection with the funding of, or by, German pension trusts or in respect of sale and
leaseback transactions funded directly or indirectly by any such pension trusts;

(t) with respect to Liens on any Capital Stock of INEOS Belgium, any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries that is not a Guarantor, any other Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor
or any Project Finance Entity, in connection with incurrence of Indebtedness by any such
Restricted Subsidiary or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or by any such Project Finance
Entity; or

(u) in the case of any Collateral, upon written notice by the Company to the Trustee and the
Security Trustee, if the release of the Lien on such Collateral is for bona fide purposes in
connection with any commercial transaction, so long as the Fair Market Value of the
Collateral being released does not exceed €2.5 million in the aggregate for any release or
series of related releases;

_provided, however, that the Company shall have the right, in its sole discretion, by written notice to the_
Trustee and the Security Trustee delivered prior to the automatic release and discharge of any Lien as
specified above, to (A) waive such automatic release and discharge of such Lien and maintain such Lien in
effect until such time as the Company shall instruct and direct the Trustee to instruct the Security Trustee in
writing to release and discharge such Lien or (B) elect that the release and discharge of such Lien shall not
occur automatically as contemplated by this paragraph but shall occur at such other time or times, in such
manner and order and upon the occurrence of such other events as shall be specified by the Company in
such notice to the Trustee and the Security Trustee; provided further that nothing in this clause (B) shall allow
the Company to require the release and discharge of any Lien prior to (unless such release and discharge
is to occur substantially concurrently with) the occurrence of the applicable event(s) set forth in clauses (a)
through (t) above providing for the release and discharge thereof.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the Notes Documents, the Issuer and each
Guarantor may, without any release or consent by the Security Trustee or the Trustee, take any action in the
ordinary course in respect of the Collateral not prohibited under the Security Documents, the Intercreditor


-----

Deed and the Indenture, including any sale, transfer, assignment or other disposition of assets in the
ordinary course of business. See “—Other”.

The Indenture will provide that any release of a Lien on Collateral may be evidenced, at the
Company’s option, by the delivery by the Company to the Security Trustee and the Trustee of an Officer’s
Certificate, and that the Trustee and the Security Trustee shall, at the Company’s request, acknowledge and
confirm receipt of such Officer’s Certificate and the release of such Lien evidenced thereby.

**_Other_**

Subject to the terms of the Security Documents, and subject to certain exceptions required to
ensure the Liens securing the Notes and the Guarantees under the Security Documents are perfected, the
Issuer and the Guarantors will have the right to remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the
Collateral, to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom and to vote in relation to the pledged shares.
The Issuer and the Guarantors may, among other things, without any release or consent by the Trustee or
the Security Trustee, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral, including, without
limitation but subject to the covenant contained under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Sale of Assets”, (i) selling or otherwise disposing of, in any transaction or series of related transactions, any_
property and assets subject to Liens under the Security Documents which has become worn out, defective
or obsolete or no longer used or useful in the business, and (ii) selling, transferring or otherwise disposing of
assets in the ordinary course of business.

No appraisal of any of the Collateral has been prepared by or on behalf of the Issuer, the Parent
or the Company in connection with the issuance of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the proceeds
from the sale of the Collateral remaining after sharing with other creditors entitled to share in such
proceeds would be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the holders of the Notes. By its nature, some
or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly,
there can be no assurance that the Collateral will be able to be sold in a short period of time, if at all. In
addition, the Intercreditor Deed places limitations on the ability of the Security Trustee to cause the sale of
the Collateral, by reference to the interests of certain creditors, including holders of the Notes, lenders
under the SFA Loans, the holders of the 2028 Senior Secured Notes, the holders of the March 2026 Senior
Secured Notes, the holders of the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes and the holders of the 2025 Senior
Secured Notes. These limitations may include requirements that some or all of the Collateral be disposed of
only pursuant to public auctions or only at a price confirmed by a valuation.

The Indenture will provide that each holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have authorized
the execution and delivery of, and to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of, the Security
Documents and the Intercreditor Deed.

**_The Notes Proceeds Loans_**

Upon the issuance of the Notes, the Issuer, as lender, and IHL, as borrower, will enter into the
Dollar Notes Proceeds Loan Agreement and the Euro Notes Proceeds Loan Agreement pursuant to which
the Issuer will loan to IHL the proceeds from the issuance of the Dollar Notes and the Euro Notes,
respectively.

The Euro Notes Proceeds Loan will be denominated in euro and will be in an aggregate principal
amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Euro Notes. The Euro Notes Proceeds Loan will
bear interest at a rate at least equal to the rate required to enable the Issuer to make payments of principal,
premium and interest (including Additional Amounts and default interest) and any costs, fees and expenses
under the Euro Notes. The Dollar Notes Proceeds Loan will be denominated in dollars and will be in an
aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Dollar Notes. The Dollar Notes
Proceeds Loan will bear interest at a rate at least equal to the rate required to enable the Issuer to make
payments of principal, premium and interest (including Additional Amounts and default interest) and any
costs, fees and expenses under the Dollar Notes.

The Notes Proceeds Loan Agreements will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Deed and
will provide that IHL will pay the Issuer interest and principal due and payable on the Notes and, in each
case, any Additional Amounts due thereunder and any costs, fees and expenses. All amounts payable under
the Notes Proceeds Loans will be payable to such account or accounts with such Person or Persons as the
Issuer may designate. The maturity date of the Notes Proceeds Loans will be the same as the maturity date
of the Notes.


-----

The obligations of IHL in respect of the Notes Proceeds Loans will rank pari passu with the
obligations of IHL in respect of its guarantee of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the SFA Proceeds
Loans, its Guarantee of the Notes, its guarantees of the 2028 Senior Secured Notes, its obligations under
the 2028 Senior Secured Notes Proceeds Loans, its guarantee of the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, its
obligations under the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes Proceeds Loan, its guarantee of the May 2026 Senior
Secured Notes, its obligations under the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes Proceeds Loan, its guarantee of
the 2025 Senior Secured Notes and its obligations under the 2025 Senior Secured Notes Proceeds Loan.
Except as otherwise required by law, all payments under the Notes Proceeds Loan Agreements will be made
without deductions or withholding for, or on account of, any applicable tax. In the event that IHL is
required to make any such deduction or withholding, it shall gross-up each payment to the Issuer to ensure
that the Issuer receives and retains a net payment equal to the payment which it would have received had
no such deduction or withholding been made.

The Notes Proceeds Loan Agreements will provide that IHL will make all payments pursuant
thereto on a timely basis in order to ensure that the Issuer can satisfy its payment obligations under the
Notes and the Indenture, taking into account the administrative and timing requirements under the Indenture
with respect to amounts payable on the Notes.

The Notes Proceeds Loans will be assigned by way of security to the Security Trustee for the
benefit of holders of the Notes, the 2028 Senior Secured Notes, the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the
May 2026 Senior Secured Notes and the 2025 Senior Secured Notes, the creditors under the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities, the Hedge Counterparties and the banks in respect of Cash Management Arrangements
as described in “Description of the Collateral and the Guarantees.”

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Euro Notes initially will be issued in the aggregate principal amount of € million and
will mature on, 2029, unless redeemed prior thereto as described herein. The Dollar Notes initially
will be issued in the aggregate principal amount of $ million and will mature on, 2029, unless
redeemed prior thereto as described herein. The Indenture will allow additional Euro Notes (the “Additional
**Euro Notes”) and additional Dollar Notes (the “Additional Dollar Notes” and, together with the Additional**
Euro Notes, the “Additional Notes”) to be issued from time to time, subject to certain limitations described
under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”; provided, however, that any Additional Notes that
are issued with the same ISIN, common code or CUSIP number will be fungible with the previously
issued applicable series of Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Each of the Euro Notes and the
Dollar Notes will constitute a separate series of Notes. The Notes and any Additional Notes will be treated
as a single class for all purposes of the Indenture, including, without limitation, waivers, amendments,
redemptions and offers to purchase, except as otherwise provided for in the Indenture.

The Euro Notes will bear interest at the rate of % per annum and the Dollar Notes will bear
interest at the rate of % per annum, in each case, from and including, 2024 or from and including
the most recent interest payment date to which interest has been paid, payable semi-annually in arrear on
and in each year, commencing on, 2024. The Issuer will make each interest payment
to the holders of record of the Euro Notes and Dollar Notes on the immediately preceding and .
Interest on the Notes will accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has already been paid,
from the interest payment date it was most recently paid. Interest on the Euro Notes and Dollar Notes will
be computed on the basis of a 360-day year composed of twelve 30-day months. Interest on overdue
principal and, to the extent permitted by law, on overdue installments of interest will accrue at the rate of
interest borne by the Euro Notes and Dollar Notes, as applicable.

Principal of, premium, if any, any applicable Additional Amounts (as defined below) and interest
on the Notes will be payable, and the Notes will be exchangeable and transferable, at the office or agency of
the Issuer in London maintained for such purposes (which initially will be the corporate trust office of the
Trustee). Principal, interest and premium, if any, on the global notes (as described below) will be payable at
the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents; provided that all such payments with respect
to Notes represented by one or more global notes registered in the name of or held by a depositary common
to Euroclear and/or Clearstream or a nominee of DTC, as applicable, will be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account specified by the holder or holders thereof. The initial Paying
Agent will be The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch.

The Euro Notes will initially be represented by one or more global notes and will be issued in fully
registered form without coupons attached and in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral


-----

multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Dollar Notes will initially be represented by one or more global
notes and will be issued in fully registered form without coupons attached and in minimum denominations
of $200,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The global notes will be deposited with a
common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, or its nominee or with a custodian for DTC or its
nominee, as applicable. Ownership of interests in the global notes, referred to as “book-entry interests,” will
be limited to Persons that have accounts with DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or
Persons that may hold interests through such participants. Book-entry interests will be shown on, and
transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in book-entry form by DTC, Euroclear
and/or Clearstream, as applicable, and their participants. Please see “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form”.

Settlement for the Notes will be made in same day funds. All payments of principal, any applicable
Additional Amounts and interest will be made by the Issuer in same day funds.

If the due date for any payment in respect of the Notes is not a Business Day, payment shall be
made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day, and no interest shall accrue for the intervening
period.

When issued, the Euro Notes and the Dollar Notes will each be a new issue of securities with no
established trading market. No assurance can be given as to the liquidity of the trading market for the
Notes. Application will be made for the Euro Notes and the Dollar Notes to be listed on the Official List of
the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to be traded on the Euro MTF Market thereof.

**_Optional Redemption_**

_Euro Notes_

The Euro Notes will be subject to redemption at any time prior to, 2026, at the option of
the Issuer, in whole or in part, on not less than five nor (except as provided under “—Selection and Notice
_of Optional Redemption”) more than 60 days’prior notice at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal_
amount thereof, plus the Applicable Redemption Premium and accrued and unpaid interest and applicable
Additional Amounts (if any) to, but not including, the redemption date (subject to the right of holders of

The Euro Notes will be subject to redemption at any time and from time to time on or after,
2026, at the option of the Issuer, in whole or in part, on not less than five nor (except as provided under
“—Selection and Notice of Optional Redemption”) more than 60 days’prior notice at the following redemption
prices (expressed as percentages of the aggregate principal amount), if redeemed during the 12-month
period beginning on of the year indicated below:

together with any applicable Additional Amounts and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not
including, the redemption date (subject to the rights of holders of record on relevant record dates to receive
interest due on an interest payment date).

In addition, at any time on or prior to, 2026, the Issuer or any Parent Holdco, at its option,
on not less than five nor (except as provided under “—Selection and Notice of Optional Redemption”) more
than 60 days’ prior notice, may use the net cash proceeds of one or more Public Equity Offerings (plus
amounts equal to any Additional Amounts and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including,
the redemption date) to redeem the Euro Notes and Additional Euro Notes in an amount up to an aggregate
of 40% of the sum of the initial aggregate principal amount of the Euro Notes originally issued under the
Indenture and the initial aggregate principal amount of any Additional Euro Notes issued under the Indenture
after the Issue Date at a redemption price equal to % of the aggregate principal amount of the Euro
Notes, plus any applicable Additional Amounts and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including,
the redemption date (subject to the rights of holders of record on relevant record dates to receive interest
due on an interest payment date); provided that Euro Notes and Additional Euro Notes in an amount equal
to at least 50% of the sum of the initial aggregate principal amount of Euro Notes originally issued under
the Indenture and the initial aggregate principal amount of any Additional Euro Notes issued under the
Indenture after the Issue Date remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such redemption.


-----

In order to effect the foregoing redemption, the Issuer must consummate such redemption within 180 days
of the closing of the Public Equity Offering.

In connection with any tender offer for, or other offer to purchase, all of the Euro Notes, if holders
of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then-outstanding Euro Notes validly tender
and do not validly withdraw such Euro Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any other Person making
such tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Euro Notes validly tendered and not validly
withdrawn by such holders, all of the holders of the Euro Notes that remain outstanding will be deemed to
have consented to a redemption of the Euro Notes on the terms set forth in this paragraph, and,
accordingly, within 60 days of such purchase, the Issuer or such other Person will have the right upon not
less than five nor more than 60 days’ notice following such purchase date, to redeem all (but not less than all)
Euro Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price equal to the highest price (excluding
any early tender premium or similar payment and, for the avoidance of doubt, any accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon) paid to each other holder in such tender offer, plus accrued
and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon, to, but not including, the date of such
redemption (subject to the rights of holders of record on the relevant record dates to receive interest due on
an interest payment date). In determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal
amount of the then-outstanding Euro Notes have validly tendered and not withdrawn such Euro Notes in a
tender offer for all of the Euro Notes, Euro Notes owned by the Issuer, an Affiliate of the Issuer or by
funds controlled or managed by any Affiliate of the Issuer, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be
outstanding and to have been tendered for the purposes of such tender offer.

_Dollar Notes_

The Dollar Notes will be subject to redemption at any time prior to, 2026, at the option of
the Issuer, in whole or in part, on not less than five nor (except as provided under “—Selection and Notice
_of Optional Redemption”) more than 60 days’prior notice at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal_
amount thereof, plus the Applicable Redemption Premium and accrued and unpaid interest and applicable
Additional Amounts (if any) to, but not including, the redemption date (subject to the right of holders of
record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

The Dollar Notes will be subject to redemption at any time and from time to time on or after,
2026, at the option of the Issuer, in whole or in part, on not less than five nor (except as provided under
“— Selection and Notice of Optional Redemption”) more than 60 days’prior notice at the following redemption
prices (expressed as percentages of the aggregate principal amount), if redeemed during the 12-month
period beginning on of the year indicated below:

together with any applicable Additional Amounts and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not
including, the redemption date (subject to the rights of holders of record on relevant record dates to receive
interest due on an interest payment date).

In addition, at any time on or prior to, 2026, the Issuer or any Parent Holdco, at its option,
on not less than five nor (except as provided under “—Selection and Notice of Optional Redemption”) more
than 60 days’ prior notice, may use the net cash proceeds of one or more Public Equity Offerings (plus
amounts equal to any Additional Amounts and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including,
the redemption date) to redeem the Dollar Notes and Additional Dollar Notes in an amount up to an
aggregate of 40% of the sum of the initial aggregate principal amount of the Dollar Notes originally issued
under the Indenture and the initial aggregate principal amount of any Additional Dollar Notes issued
under the Indenture after the Issue Date at a redemption price equal to % of the aggregate principal
amount of the Dollar Notes, plus any applicable Additional Amounts and accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, to, but not including, the redemption date (subject to the rights of holders of record on relevant record
dates to receive interest due on an interest payment date); provided that Dollar Notes and Additional
Dollar Notes in an amount equal to at least 50% of the sum of the initial aggregate principal amount of
Dollar Notes originally issued under the Indenture and the initial aggregate principal amount of any
Additional Dollar Notes issued under the Indenture after the Issue Date remains outstanding immediately


-----

after the occurrence of such redemption. In order to effect the foregoing redemption, the Issuer must
consummate such redemption within 180 days of the closing of the Public Equity Offering.

In connection with any tender offer for, or other offer to purchase, all of the Dollar Notes, if holders
of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then-outstanding Dollar Notes validly tender
and do not validly withdraw such Dollar Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any other Person
making such tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Dollar Notes validly tendered and not
validly withdrawn by such holders, all of the holders of the Dollar Notes that remain outstanding will be
deemed to have consented to a redemption of the Dollar Notes on the terms set forth in this paragraph, and,
accordingly, within 60 days of such purchase, the Issuer or such other Person will have the right upon not
less than five nor more than 60 days’ notice following such purchase date, to redeem all (but not less than all)
Dollar Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price equal to the highest price
(excluding any early tender premium or similar payment and, for the avoidance of doubt, any accrued and
unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon) paid to each other holder in such tender offer, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon, to, but not including, the date of
such redemption (subject to the rights of holders of record on the relevant record dates to receive interest
due on an interest payment date). In determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate
principal amount of the then-outstanding Dollar Notes have validly tendered and not withdrawn such Dollar
Notes in a tender offer for all of the Dollar Notes, Dollar Notes owned by the Issuer, an Affiliate of the
Issuer or by funds controlled or managed by any Affiliate of the Issuer, or any successor thereof, shall be
deemed to be outstanding and to have been tendered for the purposes of such tender offer.

**_Selection and Notice of Optional Redemption_**

If less than all of any series of Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent or the
Registrar shall select the Notes of such series for redemption on a pro rata basis or by lot (or, in the case of
Notes issued in global form as discussed under “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form”, based on a method that
most nearly approximates a pro rata or by lot selection as Euroclear, Clearstream, DTC or such successor
depositary, the Paying Agent or the Registrar, as applicable, deems fair and appropriate) unless otherwise
required by applicable law or applicable stock exchange or depositary requirements. None of the Trustee, any
Paying Agent, or the Registrar shall be liable for any selection made under this paragraph.

No Euro Notes shall be redeemed in part if the resulting Euro Note would have a minimum
denomination that is less than €100,000. No Dollar Notes shall be redeemed in part if the resulting Dollar
Note would have a minimum denomination that is less than $200,000. Notices of redemption shall be mailed
by first class mail at least five but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of
Notes to be redeemed at its registered address, except that a redemption notice may be mailed more than
60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a
satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture or as specified in the next paragraph, in each case in accordance
with the provisions of the Indenture. For Notes represented by global certificates held on behalf of
Euroclear and Clearstream or DTC, as applicable, notices may be given by delivery to Euroclear and
Clearstream or DTC for communication to entitled account owners in substitution for the aforesaid mailing.

A notice of redemption shall state: the redemption date and the record date; the redemption price
and the amount of accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, to be paid; the
paragraph of the applicable Notes pursuant to which such Notes are being redeemed; the name and address
of the Paying Agent; that the applicable Notes called for redemption must be surrendered to the Paying
Agent to collect the redemption price, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and Additional Amounts, if
any; that, unless the Issuer defaults in making the redemption payment, interest, if any, and Additional
Amounts, if any, on the applicable Notes called for redemption shall cease to accrue on and after the
redemption date; if any series of Notes is being redeemed in part, the portion of the principal amount of such
series of Notes to be redeemed; that the only remaining right of the holders of such series of Notes is to
receive payment of the redemption price upon surrender to the Paying Agent of such Notes; that, if less than
all of any series of Notes is to be redeemed, the identification of the particular Notes and the principal
amount (or portion thereof) of such Notes to be redeemed and the aggregate principal amount of such Notes
to be outstanding after such partial redemption; whether the redemption is conditioned on any events
and, if so, a detailed explanation of such conditions; and that no representation is made as to the correctness
or accuracy of the ISIN, Common Code or CUSIP numbers, if any, listed in such notice or printed on the
applicable Notes. Subject to the satisfaction of any conditions precedent set forth in a notice of redemption,
Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. If such redemption is subject to
the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, the related notice may, for the avoidance of doubt, state
that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such


-----

conditions shall be satisfied or waived (provided that in no event shall the redemption date be delayed to a
date later than 60 days from the date of the original notice of redemption, except that redemption notices may
be given more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance
of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture), and the Issuer shall provide notice of the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions prior to the redemption date for any conditional redemption, or
such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions
shall not have been satisfied or waived by the redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed. On
and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the series of Notes, or the portions thereof,
called for redemption.

So long as any Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and are
traded on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange’s Euro MTF Market and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange so require, the Issuer will inform the Luxembourg Stock Exchange of any such redemption and will
publish a notice regarding such redemption in a leading newspaper having general circulation in
Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted
by such rules, posted on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange’s official website, www.bourse.lu.

**Redemption upon Changes in Withholding Taxes**

If, as a result of:

(a) any amendment to, or change in, the laws or treaties (or regulations or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below under “—Payment of
_Additional Amounts”); or_

(b) any change in the official application or the official interpretation or administration of
such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including a holding, judgment or order by a court
of competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice)

(each of the foregoing in clauses (a) and (b), a “Change in Tax Law”), the Issuer, any Guarantor or any
Surviving Entity (as defined below under “—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets”) would be obligated
to pay, on the next date for any payment, Additional Amounts, as described below under “—Payment of
_Additional Amounts”, with respect to the Notes of any series which the Issuer, such Guarantor or such_
Surviving Entity cannot avoid by the use of reasonable measures available to it (including, without limitation,
making payment through a paying agent located in another jurisdiction), then the Issuer or the Surviving
Entity, as the case may be, may redeem, at its option, all, but not less than all, of the Notes of the relevant
series at any time on or after the Issue Date and following such Change in Tax Law, upon not less than 30 nor
more than 60 days’ notice to the holders of the relevant series of Notes, at a redemption price of 100% of
their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date.

In the case of the United Kingdom or any other jurisdiction that is a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
on the Issue Date, the applicable Change in Tax Law must become effective on or after the date of this
offering memorandum. In the case of a jurisdiction that becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction after the
Issue Date, the applicable Change in Tax Law must become effective after the date that such jurisdiction
becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction.

Prior to the giving of any notice of redemption described in this section, the Issuer or the Surviving
Entity, as the case may be, will deliver to the Trustee in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee:

(i) an Officer’s Certificate of the Issuer, or the Surviving Entity, as the case may be, stating
that the obligation to pay such Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the Issuer, such
Guarantor or such Surviving Entity taking reasonable measures available to it; and

(ii) a written opinion of independent legal counsel of recognized standing addressed to the
Issuer or the Surviving Entity, as the case may be, to the effect that the Issuer, such Guarantor
or such Surviving Entity has or will become obligated to pay such Additional Amounts
as a result of a Change in Tax Law described above.

The Trustee will accept without further inquiry such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient
evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions to a redemption upon a Change in Tax Law, including any
changes in withholding Taxes, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the holders of the Notes.


-----

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice will be given (a) earlier than 90 days prior to the
earliest date on which the Issuer or the relevant Surviving Entity or Guarantor, as the case may be, would
be obligated to pay such Additional Amounts if a payment were then due and (b) unless, at the time such
notice is given, such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts remains in effect.

**Payment of Additional Amounts**

All payments by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Surviving Entity under or with respect to the
Notes, or by or on behalf of any Guarantor or any Surviving Entity with respect to any Guarantee, will be
made free and clear of, and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes, unless such
withholding or deduction is required by law or by the official interpretation or administration of law, or
by an applicable certification, identification, information or other reporting requirement or agreement, if
entering into or complying with such requirement or agreement is required by law or by a taxing authority
as a precondition to relief or exemption from such Tax. If any amount for, or on account of, Taxes imposed
or levied by or on behalf of any jurisdiction in which the Issuer, any Guarantor or, if applicable, any
Surviving Entity, is incorporated, organized, resident for Tax purposes or otherwise subject to Tax or from
or through which any payment is made on or with respect to the Notes or a Guarantee by any taxing authority
therein or political subdivision thereof (each, as applicable, a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”) is required to
be withheld or deducted from any payment made under or with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee, the
Issuer, such Guarantor or such Surviving Entity, as the case may be, will pay such additional amounts
(“Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary to ensure that the net amount received after such withholding
or deduction will be not less than the amount that would have been received if such Taxes had not been
required to be withheld or deducted.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Additional Amounts will be payable in respect of or on
account of:

(a) any Taxes that are imposed or levied by a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction by reason of the
holder’s or beneficial owner’s present or former connection with such Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction, including, without limitation, the holder or beneficial owner being, or having
been, a citizen, national, or resident, being, or having been, engaged in a trade or business,
being, or having been, physically present in or having or having had a permanent
establishment in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (but not including, in each case, any
connection arising from the mere holding of Notes or the receipt of payments thereunder
or under a Guarantee or the exercise or enforcement of rights under any Notes or the
Indenture or a Guarantee);

(b) any Taxes that are imposed or levied by reason of the failure of the holder or beneficial
owner of Notes (or any financial institution through which the holder or beneficial owner
holds the Notes or through which payment on the Notes is made), following the written
request of the Issuer, any Guarantor or any Surviving Entity (as the case may be) made at
a time that would enable the holder or beneficial owner (or any such financial institution)
acting reasonably to comply with that request and in accordance with the notice procedures
set forth in the Indenture, to comply with any certification, identification, information or
other reporting requirements, whether required by statute, treaty, regulation or
administrative practice of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, as a precondition to exemption
from, or reduction in the rate of withholding or deduction of, Taxes imposed by the Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, a certification that the holder or
beneficial owner is not resident in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction);

(c) any estate, inheritance, gift, sale, excise, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

(d) any Tax that is payable otherwise than by withholding or deduction from payments made
under or with respect to the Notes or a Guarantee;

(e) any Tax that is imposed or levied by reason of the presentation (where presentation is
required in order to receive payment) of such Notes for payment on a date more than
30 days after the date on which such payment became due and payable or the date on which
payment thereof is duly provided for, whichever is later, except to the extent that the
beneficial owner or holder thereof would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had
the Notes been presented for payment on any date during such 30-day period;


-----

(f) any Tax that is imposed or levied on or with respect to a payment made to a holder or
beneficial owner of Notes who would have been able to avoid such withholding or deduction
by presenting the Notes to another Paying Agent in a Member State of the European
Union;

(g) [Reserved];

(h) any Taxes that are imposed or withheld pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the
Code, as of the Issue Date (or any amended or successor version of such sections), any
regulations promulgated thereunder, any official interpretations thereof, any agreements
entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b)(1) of the Code, any intergovernmental agreement
between a non-U.S. jurisdiction and the United States with respect to the foregoing or
any law or regulation implementing any such intergovernmental agreement;

(i) any Tax that is payable in accordance with the Luxembourg law of 23 December 2005 (as
amended) introducing a withholding tax on certain interest paid to Luxembourg resident
individuals; or

(j) any combination of items (a) through (i) above.

Notwithstanding the first paragraph of this section, Additional Amounts will not be paid with
respect to the Notes to a holder who is a fiduciary, a partnership, a limited liability company or any person
other than the sole beneficial owner of the payment under or with respect to the Notes, to the extent that
a beneficiary or settlor with respect to the fiduciary, a member of that partnership, an interest holder in that
limited liability company or a beneficial owner would not have been entitled to the Additional Amounts
had it been the holder of the Notes.

The Issuer, the relevant Guarantor or the relevant Surviving Entity, as the case may be, will
(i) make such withholding or deduction as is required by applicable law and (ii) remit the full amount
withheld or deducted to the relevant taxing authority in accordance with applicable law.

At least 30 calendar days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the
Notes is due and payable, if the Issuer, any Guarantor or a Surviving Entity will be obligated to pay
Additional Amounts with respect to such payment (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts
arises after the 30th day prior to the date on which payment under or with respect to the Notes is due and
payable, in which case it will be promptly thereafter), the Issuer, the relevant Guarantor or the relevant
Surviving Entity (as the case may be) will deliver to the Trustee (with a copy to the Paying Agent) an
Officer’s Certificate in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee stating that such Additional
Amounts will be payable and the amounts so payable and will set forth such other information necessary
to enable the Paying Agent to pay such Additional Amounts to holders on the payment date. The Trustee shall
be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.
The Issuer, the relevant Guarantor or the relevant Surviving Entity, as the case may be, will promptly publish
a notice in accordance with the notice provisions set forth in the Indenture stating that such Additional
Amounts will be payable and describing the obligation to pay such amounts.

Upon written request, the Issuer, the relevant Guarantor or the relevant Surviving Entity, as the
case may be, will furnish to the Trustee or to a holder of the Notes copies of tax receipts evidencing the
payment of any Taxes by the Issuer, such Guarantor or such Surviving Entity in such form as provided in
the normal course by the taxing authority imposing such Taxes and as is reasonably available to the Issuer,
such Guarantor or such Surviving Entity. If, notwithstanding the efforts of the Issuer, such Guarantor or
such Surviving Entity to obtain such receipts, the same are not obtainable, the Issuer, such Guarantor or such
Surviving Entity will provide the Trustee or such holder with other evidence reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee or such holder.

In addition, the Issuer, any Guarantor and any Surviving Entity, as the case may be, will pay any
present or future stamp, issue, registration, court, documentation, excise or property taxes or other similar
taxes, charges and duties, including interest and penalties with respect thereto, imposed by or in any Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction in respect of the execution, issue, enforcement or delivery of the Notes or any other
document or instrument referred to thereunder (other than on or in connection with (i) a transfer of the
Notes other than the initial resale by the Initial Purchasers, (ii) the issue of replacement Notes or certificated
Notes pursuant to the Indenture or (iii) Luxembourg registration duties (droits d’enregistrement) payable
due to a voluntary registration, submission or filing with the Administration de l’enregistrement, des domaines
_et de la TVA of any Security Document or the Intercreditor Deed by a holder of Notes or the Security_


-----

Trustee where such registration, submission or filing is or was not required to maintain, preserve, establish
or enforce the rights of such holder of Notes or the Security Trustee under any Security Document or the
Intercreditor Deed).

Whenever the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of the Notes” refers to, in any context, the
payment of principal, premium, if any, interest or any other amount payable under or with respect to any
Note or with respect to any Guarantee, such reference includes the payment of Additional Amounts, if
applicable.

**Currency Indemnity**

The Euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer or any
Guarantor under the Euro Notes and any Guarantee of the Euro Notes. Any amount received or recovered
in currency other than Euro in respect of the Euro Notes (whether as a result of, or as a result of the
enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding up or dissolution of the
Parent, the Issuer, any Subsidiary of the Parent or otherwise) by the Trustee or holder in respect of any sum
expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or any Guarantor of the Euro Notes shall constitute a discharge
of the Issuer or any Guarantor of the Euro Notes only to the extent of the Euro amount which the recipient
is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that
receipt or recovery (or, if it is not possible to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it
is possible to do so). If that Euro amount is less than the Euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient
under any Euro Note, the Issuer and each Guarantor of the Euro Notes, jointly and severally, shall
indemnify the recipient against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this indemnity, it
will be sufficient for the holder to certify (indicating the sources of information used) that it would have
suffered a loss had the actual purchase of Euro been made with the amount so received in that other currency
on the date of receipt or recovery (or, if a purchase of Euro on such date had not been possible, on the
first date on which it would have been possible).

The Dollar is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer or any
Guarantor under the Dollar Notes and any Guarantee of the Dollar Notes. Any amount received or
recovered in currency other than Dollars in respect of the Dollar Notes (whether as a result of, or as a
result of the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding up or
dissolution of the Parent, the Issuer, any Subsidiary of the Parent or otherwise) by the Trustee or holder in
respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or any Guarantor of the Dollar Notes shall
constitute a discharge of the Issuer or any Guarantor of the Dollar Notes only to the extent of the Dollar
amount which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency
on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not possible to make that purchase on that date, on the
first date on which it is possible to do so). If that Dollar amount is less than the Dollar amount expressed
to be due to the recipient under any Dollar Note, the Issuer and each Guarantor of the Dollar Notes, jointly
and severally, shall indemnify the recipient against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes
of this indemnity, it will be sufficient for the holder to certify (indicating the sources of information used) that
it would have suffered a loss had the actual purchase of Dollars been made with the amount so received in
that other currency on the date of receipt or recovery (or, if a purchase of Dollars on such date had not been
possible, on the first date on which it would have been possible).

Each of the above indemnities will, to the extent permitted by law:

    - constitute a separate and independent obligation from the other obligations of the Issuer and
any Guarantor;

     - give rise to a separate and independent cause of action;

    - apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any holder; and

     - continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated
amount in respect of any sum due under any Note or any other judgment or order.

**Sinking Fund**

The Notes will not be entitled to the benefit of any sinking fund.

**Open Market Purchases**

The Parent, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries may at any time and from time to time
purchase Notes in the open market or otherwise.


-----

**Purchase of Notes upon a Change of Control**

If a Change of Control shall occur at any time, then each holder of Notes shall have the right to
require that the Issuer purchase such holder’s Notes in whole or in part (equal to €100,000 or $200,000, as
the case may be, or an integral multiple of €1,000 or $1,000, as the case may be, in excess thereof), at a
purchase price (the “Change of Control Purchase Price”) in cash in an amount equal to 101% of the
principal amount of such Notes, plus any Additional Amounts and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to,
but not including, the date of purchase (the “Change of Control Purchase Date”) (subject to the rights of
holders of record on relevant record dates to receive interest due on an interest payment date), pursuant to
the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) and in accordance with the other procedures set
forth in the Indenture; provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be obliged to repurchase any series of
Notes as described under this caption “—Purchase of Notes upon a Change of Control” in the event and to
the extent that it has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all of the Notes of such series as described
under “—Optional Redemption”. No such purchase in part shall reduce the principal amount at maturity
of the Notes held by any holder to below €100,000, in the case of the Euro Notes, or $200,000, in the case of
the Dollar Notes.

Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer shall notify the Trustee thereof and
give written notice of such Change of Control to each holder of Notes by first class mail, postage prepaid,
at the address appearing in the security register, stating, among other things:

    - that a Change of Control has occurred and the date of such event;

    - the circumstances and relevant facts regarding such Change of Control (including, but not
limited to, applicable information with respect to pro forma historical income, cash flow and
capitalization after giving effect to the Change of Control);

    - the purchase price and the purchase date which shall be fixed by the Issuer on a Business Day no
earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed, or such later
date as is necessary to comply with requirements under the U.S. Exchange Act;

     - that any Note not tendered will continue to accrue interest and, unless the Issuer defaults in
payment of the Change of Control Purchase Price, any Notes accepted for payment pursuant to
the Change of Control Offer shall cease to accrue interest after the Change of Control Purchase
Date; and

    - any other procedures that a holder of Notes must follow to accept a Change of Control Offer or
to withdraw such acceptance.

The Issuer shall make available to the newswire service of Bloomberg (or if Bloomberg does not
then operate, any similar agency) or, so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange and are traded on the Euro MTF Market thereof and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange so require, a newspaper having general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the
_Luxemburger Wort) or on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange’s official website, www.bourse.lu, the notice_
described above.

The ability of the Issuer to repurchase Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be
limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control
would constitute an event of default under the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement. In addition,
certain events that may constitute a change of control under the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement
may not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture. The future Indebtedness of the Issuer, the
Parent and its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of
Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the
exercise by the holders of the Notes of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause
a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial
effect of such repurchase on the Issuer, the Parent and its Subsidiaries. Finally, the ability of the Issuer to
pay cash to the holders of the Notes upon a repurchase may be limited by its and the Company’s thenexisting financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary
to make any required repurchases.

The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable whether or not any other
provisions of the Indenture are applicable, except, for the avoidance of doubt, to the extent satisfaction and
discharge of the Indenture, as described under “—Satisfaction and Discharge,” has occurred or the Issuer
has elected to exercise its option for Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance, as described under


-----

“—Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance of Indenture,” in each case prior to the occurrence of a Change of
Control. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture will not contain
provisions that permit the holders of the Notes to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in
the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a holder’s right to require
the Issuer to repurchase such holder’s Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third
party from seeking to acquire the Issuer, the Parent or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute
a Change of Control.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a
third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance
with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer
and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer.

The Paying Agent will promptly deliver to each holder of Notes properly tendered the Change of
Control Purchase Price for such Notes and the Trustee will, in respect of the global notes, make such
notations thereon as are necessary to reflect the Notes (or interest therein) purchased in such Change of
Control Offer, and the Paying Agent will, in respect of certificated notes, cause to be authenticated and
mailed to each holder a new certificated note or notes equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion
of Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new note will be in a principal amount of €100,000
or $200,000, as applicable, or an integral multiple of €1,000 or $1,000, as applicable, in excess thereof. The
Issuer will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on, or as soon as practicable after,
the Change of Control Purchase Date.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the
assets of the Company. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or
substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly,
in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would
involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company. As a result, it may be
unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether the Issuer must make an offer to
repurchase the Notes as described above.

The Issuer will comply with the applicable tender offer rules, including Rule 14e-1 under the U.S.
Exchange Act, and any other applicable securities laws or regulations, including administrative interpretations
thereof (including those of the United States and the United Kingdom), in connection with a Change of
Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any applicable securities laws or regulations conflict with
the provisions of this covenant (other than the obligation to make an offer pursuant to this covenant), the
Issuer will comply with the securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its
obligations described in this covenant by virtue thereof.

**Certain Calculations**

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Indenture or any other Note Document,
solely for the purposes of determining whether a Limited Condition Transaction may be
consummated or any related transaction, including the assumption or incurrence of any
Indebtedness or Liens, may be consummated in connection therewith, (i) each of the
Parent’s Consolidated EBITDA, the Parent’s Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio,
the Parent’s Consolidated Net Total Leverage Ratio, the Parent’s Consolidated Net
Senior Secured Leverage Ratio and the Total Assets may, at the Company’s election, be
determined as of the last day of or for the most recent period of four full fiscal quarters for
which financial statements are available as of the date the definitive agreement for such
Limited Condition Transaction is entered into (or, if applicable, in the case of any
Acquisition or Investment made pursuant to a tender or similar offer, as of the date such
offer has been commenced or, in the case of a Permitted Payment or Restricted Payment, as
of the date of the declaration thereof or the date of the delivery of irrevocable (which
may be conditional) notice with respect thereto) (and shall not be tested again on the date
on which such Limited Condition Transaction or any related transaction, including the
assumption or incurrence of any Indebtedness or Liens, is consummated) and shall be
calculated giving pro forma effect to both the consummation of such Limited Condition
Transaction and any related transaction, including the assumption or incurrence of any
Indebtedness or Liens; provided that, following any such election by the Company with
respect to any Limited Condition Transaction (and which Limited Condition Transaction


-----

has not yet been consummated and with respect to which such definitive agreement,
tender or similar offer, declaration or notice has not been terminated or been revoked
without the consummation thereof), any subsequent calculation or determination (including
any subsequent calculation or determination made in reliance on this paragraph (a)) of
any such ratio or other metric shall be made giving pro forma effect to the consummation
of such Limited Condition Transaction and any related transaction, including the
assumption or incurrence of any Indebtedness or Liens and (ii) any condition thereto as to
the absence of any Default or Event of Default may, at the Company’s election, be
determined as of the date the definitive agreement for such Limited Condition Transaction
is entered into (or, if applicable, in the case of any Acquisition or Investment made
pursuant to a tender or similar offer, as of the date such offer has been commenced or, in
the case of a Permitted Payment or Restricted Payment, as of the date of the declaration
thereof or the date of the delivery of irrevocable (which may be conditional) notice with
respect thereto) (and shall not be tested again on the date on which such Limited Condition
Transaction or any related transaction, including the assumption or incurrence of any
Indebtedness or Liens, is consummated). For the avoidance of doubt, in making any
determination contemplated by this paragraph (a) as to any amounts in Dollars, Euro or
any other currency, it is understood that the Company may, at its election, select currency
exchange rates in effect (x) as of the last day of the most recent period of four full fiscal
quarters for which financial statements are available as of the date the definitive agreement
for such Limited Condition Transaction is entered into (or, if applicable, in the case of
any Acquisition or Investment made pursuant to a tender or similar offer, as of the date
such offer has been commenced or, in the case of a Permitted Payment or Restricted
Payment, as of the date of the declaration thereof or the date of the delivery of irrevocable
(which may be conditional) notice with respect thereto), (y) as of the date the definitive
agreement for such Limited Condition Transaction is entered into (or, if applicable, in the
case of any Acquisition or Investment made pursuant to a tender or similar offer, as of
the date such offer has been commenced or, in the case of a Permitted Payment or Restricted
Payment, as of the date of the declaration thereof or the date of the delivery of irrevocable
(which may be conditional) notice with respect thereto) or (z) as of the date on which
such Limited Condition Transaction or such related transaction, including the assumption
or incurrence of any Indebtedness or Liens, is consummated.

(b) For purposes of determining Consolidated EBITDA, the Consolidated Net Total Leverage
Ratio, the Consolidated Net Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Income Tax Expense, Consolidated Interest Expense,
Consolidated Net Income (Loss), Consolidated Non-Cash Charges, Consolidated
revenues, Excess Proceeds, Net Cash Proceeds (including for purposes of paragraph
(b) under the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted
_Payments”) or any other financial ratio, basket calculation or financial measurement of any_
kind whatsoever of the Parent, the Company, the Financial Group or the Restricted
Group in respect of a period commencing prior to the date of completion of any Permitted
Reorganization and ending on or after such date, such determination shall be made using
the results for the applicable period prior to such date of the Parent, the Company, the
Financial Group or the Restricted Group as in effect during such prior period and the
results for the applicable period on and after such date of the Parent, the Company, the
Financial Group or the Restricted Group as in effect during such subsequent period. For
purposes of each of clauses (1) and (2) under the first paragraph of the covenant described
under “—Certain Covenants—Provision of Financial Statements”, at any time when the
most recent fiscal year or fiscal quarter, as applicable, ended after the date of the completion
of any Permitted Reorganization and the comparable prior year period ended prior to
such date, the financial statements delivered in respect of such prior period may be those
of the Parent as of the last day of such prior fiscal year or fiscal quarter, as applicable.

(c) For purposes of determining the permissibility of any action, change, transaction or event
that requires a calculation of any financial ratio, Consolidated EBITDA, Total Assets,
Fair Market Value or any other financial metric, such financial ratio or such other test shall
be calculated at the time such action is taken, such change is made, such transaction is
consummated or such event occurs, as the case may be (or, in each case, such other time as
is applicable thereto pursuant to paragraph (a) of “—Certain Calculations”), it being
understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that for purposes of determining compliance with


-----

any Consolidated EBITDA or Total Asset percentage restriction in connection with any
Acquisition or Investment, the amount of the Consolidated EBITDA or the Total Assets
will be determined after giving pro forma effect thereto, and no Default or Event of Default
shall occur solely as a result of a subsequent change in such financial ratio, Consolidated
EBITDA, Total Assets, Fair Market Value or other financial metric, as the case may be.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Indebtedness” or “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens”, (i) in connection with the_
incurrence of any Indebtedness, or any Lien securing any Indebtedness, in each case, in
reliance on any exception set forth in “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”or
“—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens”that is based on a percentage of Consolidated
EBITDA or Total Assets, the amount of Consolidated EBITDA or Total Assets shall be
determined after giving pro forma effect to the application of the proceeds of such
Indebtedness (and any other Indebtedness incurred substantially concurrently therewith),
and any Indebtedness, or any Lien securing any Indebtedness, in each case, incurred in
reliance on any exception set forth in “—Certain Covenants— Limitation on Indebtedness”
or “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens” that is based on a financial ratio or
a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA or Total Assets will be permitted to be refinanced
under such exception (if otherwise complying with the requirements of such exception)
notwithstanding that, at the time of and after giving effect to such refinancing, the
amount thereof might exceed the applicable financial ratio or the applicable percentage of
Consolidated EBITDA or Total Assets, solely as a result of a subsequent change in such
financial ratio, Consolidated EBITDA or Total Assets, and (ii) in the case of any obligation
to purchase or repurchase any inventory as part of any inventory financing or similar
arrangement, no Default or Event of Default shall occur solely as a result of a change in
the Fair Market Value of such inventory after the date of the initial incurrence of such
obligation, and such inventory financing or similar arrangement incurred in reliance on
any exception set forth in “—Certain Covenants— Limitation on Indebtedness”or “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Liens” will be permitted to be refinanced under such exception_
(if otherwise complying with the requirements of such exception) notwithstanding that, at
the time of and after giving effect to such refinancing, the amount thereof might exceed
the applicable cap set forth in such exception. For purposes of the Indenture, whenever
_pro forma effect is to be given to any transaction or calculation, the pro forma calculations_
will be as determined in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of
the Parent.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, for purposes of determining
compliance with any of the covenants described under the captions “—Certain Covenants”
or “—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets”, in the event that any Indebtedness,
Lien, Restricted Payment, Permitted Payment, Investment, Asset Sale or other transaction
(each of the foregoing, an “Item”) (or any portion thereof) meets the criteria of more
than one of the exceptions set forth under such captions (or in any applicable defined term
used under such caption), the classification of such Item (or any portion thereof) on the
date of its incurrence, making, undertaking or consummation under any such exception
shall be made by the Company in its sole discretion and the Company may, at any time or
from time to time thereafter, in its sole discretion, reclassify such Item (or any portion
thereof) as having been incurred, made, undertaken or consummated under one or more
other exceptions set forth under such caption (or in any applicable defined term used under
such caption) if such Item (or such portion thereof) (i) at the time of its incurrence,
making, undertaking or consummation, would have been permitted under such other
exception or exceptions (but after giving effect to such other Item or Items (but not, for
the avoidance of doubt, any other change in circumstance) that were incurred, made,
undertaken or consummated since such time in reliance on such other exception or
exceptions) or (ii) solely in the case of any Indebtedness, Lien, Restricted Payment, Permitted
Payment or Investment, at the time of such reclassification would have met the criteria
set forth in such other exception or exceptions if then incurred, made, undertaken or
consummated and, in each case, such Item shall constitute a usage of any availability under
such exception only to the extent so classified or reclassified. In addition, the Company
may, at any time or from time to time thereafter, in its sole discretion, reclassify (or deem
such reclassification to have occurred automatically) any Indebtedness, Lien, Restricted
Payment, Permitted Payment or Investment (or any portion thereof), as applicable,


-----

previously incurred, made, undertaken or consummated under any basket other than a
“ratio-based” basket as having been incurred, made, undertaken or consummated under
any applicable “ratio-based”basket set forth under such caption (or in any applicable defined
term used under such caption) if such Item (or such portion thereof) would, using the
figures as of the last day of or for any period of four full fiscal quarters for which financial
statements are available on or after the date of such incurrence, making, undertaking or
consummation, be permitted under the applicable “ratio-based” basket. For the avoidance
of doubt, any amount so classified or reclassified to any applicable “ratio-based” basket
shall be disregarded, and shall be deemed not to be outstanding, for purposes of determining
the amount of availability under any other applicable exception under such caption
(including, in the case of clause (b)(1) under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Indebtedness”, any other applicable clause under such caption) that does not require_
compliance with a ratio. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Indebtedness incurred under the
Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement outstanding on the Issue Date (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the SFA Loans to be borrowed in connection with the Transactions)
shall be deemed to have been incurred pursuant to clause (1)(A)(x) of paragraph (b) of
“—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and may not be subsequently
reclassified.

(e) For purposes of assessing whether any financial ratio or test set forth in any of the
covenants described under the captions “—Certain Covenants” or “—Consolidation,
_Merger and Sale of Assets” (or in any applicable defined term used under such captions)_
has been or would be complied with in connection with any Item (or any portion thereof)
incurred, made, undertaken or consummated in reliance on an exception that requires
compliance with such financial ratio or test, any other Item (or any portion thereof)
substantially contemporaneously incurred, made, undertaken or consummated, in each
case, in reliance on any other available exceptions that do not require such other Item (or
such portion thereof) to comply with such financial ratio or test (including, in the case of
Indebtedness limited by clause (1)(B) of paragraph (b) under “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Indebtedness”, any other sub-clause of such clause (1)) shall be disregarded_
(even if part of the same transaction and, in the case of Indebtedness or Liens securing any
Indebtedness, even if such other Item is Indebtedness of the same tranche or series as
such Indebtedness being incurred under such financial ratio or test); provided that full
_pro forma effect shall be given to such other Item (or such portion thereof) for purposes of_
determining any increase in the amount of Consolidated EBITDA or Total Assets
resulting therefrom.

(f) For purposes of determining compliance with the Indenture, (i) the outstanding principal
amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof shall
be equal to the amount thereof that would appear on a consolidated balance sheet of the
Parent prepared in conformity with IFRS and (ii) the accrual of interest, the accrual of
dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of original issue discount,
the payment of interest or a dividend in the form of additional Indebtedness and/or any
increase in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of any fluctuation in
the exchange rate of any applicable currency shall not be deemed to be an incurrence of
Indebtedness and, to the extent secured, shall not be deemed to result in an increase of the
obligations so secured or to be a grant of a Lien securing any such obligations.

(g) Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Indenture, all terms of an accounting or
financial nature used therein will be construed in accordance with IFRS as in effect from
time to time; provided that if the Company, by written notice to the Trustee, shall request an
amendment to any provision hereof to eliminate the effect of any change occurring after
the Issue Date in IFRS or in the application thereof on the operation of such provision,
regardless of whether any such notice is given before or after such change in IFRS or in the
application thereof, then such provision shall be interpreted on the basis of IFRS as in
effect and applied immediately before such change shall have become effective until such
notice shall have been withdrawn or such provision amended in accordance herewith and
therewith. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of any calculations pursuant to the
Indenture (but not for purposes of the financial statements required to be delivered
pursuant to the covenant described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Provision of
_Financial Statements”), IFRS shall be deemed to treat operating leases in a manner_


-----

consistent with the treatment thereof under IFRS as in effect on January 1, 2018,
notwithstanding any modifications or interpretative changes thereto that may have
occurred or may occur after such date.

(h) For all purposes under the Notes Documents, in connection with any division or plan of
division under Delaware law (or any comparable event under a different jurisdiction’s laws):
(i) if any asset, right, obligation or liability of any Person becomes the asset, right,
obligation or liability of a different Person, then it shall be deemed to have been transferred
from the original Person to the subsequent Person, and (ii) if any new Person comes into
existence, such new Person shall be deemed to have been organized on the first date of its
existence by the holders of its Capital Stock at such time.

**Certain Covenants**

The Indenture will contain, among others, the following covenants:

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

(a) The Company will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to,

clause (1) shall not exceed the sum of (x) the aggregate principal amount of each

Secured Leverage Ratio as of the last day of the most recent period of four full
fiscal quarters for which financial statements are available immediately preceding
the incurrence of such Indebtedness is not greater than 3.00 to 1.00, provided that
solely for the purpose of determining the Consolidated Net Senior Secured

on this clause (B) shall be deemed to be (whether or not it actually is) Senior
Secured Indebtedness;

(2) [Reserved];

(6) Indebtedness of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries outstanding
on the Issue Date after giving pro forma effect to the use of proceeds of the offering

extent required by, the Intercreditor Deed; provided, further, that any disposition or
transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person (other than a disposition or

Company or such Restricted Subsidiary is otherwise permitted by the Indenture;
_provided that if the Indebtedness being guaranteed is subordinated in right of_
payment to the Notes or any Guarantee, then such guarantee, if provided by the
Issuer, the Company or a Subsidiary Guarantor, will be subordinated to the Notes
or such Guarantee, as applicable, substantially to the same extent as the relevant
Indebtedness guaranteed;

any refinancing of any Indebtedness permitted under this clause (25).

(c) [Reserved].

(d) For purposes of determining any particular amount of Indebtedness under this
“—Limitation on Indebtedness” covenant and compliance with this “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness” covenant, (i) guarantees, Liens or obligations with respect to letters of credit,_
bank guarantees, bankers’ acceptances or similar instruments supporting Indebtedness
that is otherwise included in the determination of any such particular amount will be
disregarded, (ii) in the case of any new Indebtedness of the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries the net proceeds of which are to be applied to refinance any existing
Indebtedness of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, the determination of any
such particular amount and such compliance will be made on a pro forma basis giving effect
to the application of the net proceeds of such new Indebtedness as if such application
occurred on the date of incurrence thereof, (iii) any Proceeds Loans made by a Parent
Holdco or a Financing Subsidiary with the proceeds of any Indebtedness incurred by such
Parent Holdco or Financing Subsidiary, which Indebtedness is guaranteed by the
Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in accordance with this “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness” covenant, will be disregarded and (iv) if obligations in respect of letters of_
credit, bank guarantees, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are incurred
pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as incurred pursuant to clause (1),
(12), (13), (21), (22) or (25) of paragraph (b) of this “—Limitation on Indebtedness”covenant
or pursuant to paragraph (a) of this “—Limitation on Indebtedness” covenant, then to
the extent such letters of credit, bank guarantees, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments support other Indebtedness, such other Indebtedness will be disregarded.

(e) For purposes of determining compliance with this “—Limitation on Indebtedness”
covenant and the “—Limitation on Liens” covenant:

(i) in the case of any exception requiring compliance with any financial ratio or test,
to the extent the committed amount of any Indebtedness has been tested, such
committed amount may thereafter be borrowed and, in the case of commitments
of a revolving nature, reborrowed in whole or in part, from time to time, without
any further testing under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness” covenant or the
covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on Liens”, it being understood,
however, that for purposes of any subsequent determination of compliance with
such financial ratio or test, such Indebtedness (other than, for purposes of


-----

paragraph (a) under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness” covenant, any
Indebtedness that is revolving in nature) shall, solely to the extent of the reliance
at such time on this clause (i) with respect to such committed amount, be deemed to
be outstanding;

(ii) any Escrow Indebtedness shall be deemed to be incurred on the date of the
original incurrence thereof (and, for the avoidance of doubt, not on the date of
the release of such Indebtedness from escrow or the date on which the obligor in
respect of such Indebtedness becomes a Restricted Subsidiary or transfers its assets
to, or merges, consolidates or amalgamates with, the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary); provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, any Escrow Indebtedness
that is redeemed pursuant to a special mandatory redemption or the proceeds of
which are not released to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary for any other
reason shall be deemed not to have been incurred by the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary on the date of original incurrence thereof; and

(iii) such determinations and calculations in connection with any Limited Condition
Transaction or any related transaction shall be subject to paragraph (a) under
“—Certain Calculations” above.

(f) For purposes of determining compliance with any Euro-denominated restriction on the
incurrence of Indebtedness where Indebtedness is denominated in a different currency, the
amount of such Indebtedness will be the Euro Equivalent determined on the date of
such determination; provided, however, that if any such Indebtedness that is denominated
in a different currency is subject to a Currency Hedging Agreement (with respect to Euro)
covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such
Indebtedness expressed in Euro will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such
agreement. The principal amount of any Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness, if incurred
in the same currency as the Indebtedness being refinanced, will be the Euro Equivalent of
the Indebtedness refinanced, determined on the date such Indebtedness being refinanced
was initially incurred. The principal amount of any Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness, if
incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, will be calculated
based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Permitted
Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this “—Limitation on Indebtedness” covenant, the
maximum amount that the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur
pursuant to this “—Limitation on Indebtedness” covenant shall not be deemed to be
exceeded, with respect to any outstanding Indebtedness, solely as a result of fluctuations
in the exchange rates of currencies (and, for the avoidance of doubt, such Indebtedness will
be permitted to be refinanced notwithstanding that, after giving effect to such refinancing,
such excess will continue). Notwithstanding the foregoing, any determinations and
calculations pursuant to this paragraph (f) in connection with any Limited Condition
Transaction or any related transaction shall be subject to paragraph (a) under “—Certain
_Calculations”._

following actions (any action permitted under any of clauses (1) through (17) below being

(23) any transaction effected as part of a Permitted Reorganization.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Company will not, and will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or
indirectly, create, incur, assume, affirm or suffer to exist any Lien (the “Initial Lien”) of any kind securing
any Indebtedness upon any property or assets of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, including any
Capital Stock or intercompany notes or other Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary, owned on the Issue
Date or acquired thereafter, or any income, profits or proceeds therefrom, except (a) in the case of any
property or asset that does not constitute Collateral, (i) Permitted Liens and (ii) Liens on property or assets
that are not Permitted Liens if the Notes and the Guarantees are, subject to the Security Principles,
directly secured equally and ratably or on a prior basis with the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien
(and if such Indebtedness so secured is Subordinated Indebtedness, on a senior priority basis) and (b) in the
case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens (for the avoidance of
doubt, it being understood that any Lien existing in reliance on clause (a)(ii) above shall not also be required
to be a Permitted Collateral Lien notwithstanding that the assets subject thereto shall have become
Collateral).


-----

Any Lien created for the benefit of the holders of the Notes pursuant to clause (a)(ii) of the
preceding paragraph of this covenant will, and will be deemed to, provide by its terms that such Lien will
be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged, without any action by the Trustee, the Security
Trustee or the holders of the Notes (and each holder of the Notes will be deemed to have irrevocably
authorized the Trustee and the Security Trustee to execute and deliver (and, at the request and cost of the
Company, each of the Trustee and the Security Trustee will execute and deliver) any document to the extent
necessary or reasonably requested by the Company to evidence such release and discharge), (a) upon the
release and discharge of the applicable Initial Lien, (b) upon the sale or other disposition of the property or
assets subject to such Initial Lien (or the sale or other disposition of the Person that owns such property
or assets) in compliance with the terms of the Indenture, (c) with respect to the property or assets of, or the
Capital Stock in, any Guarantor that is encumbered by such Lien, upon the release of the Guarantee of
such Guarantor in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, (d) with respect to the property or assets of,
or the Capital Stock in, any Restricted Subsidiary that are encumbered by such Lien, upon the designation
of such Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the terms of the Indenture,
(e) upon effectiveness of any defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes as specified in the
Indenture, (f) in the case of any Lien on any Proceeds Loan, upon the payment in full or other discharge of
such Proceeds Loan (including as a result of any merger, consolidation or amalgamation of the payor or
the payee thereunder) or (g) as otherwise provided under the caption “—Brief Description of the Notes, the
_Guarantees and the Security—Security—Release of Security”; provided, however, that the Company shall_
have the right, in its sole discretion, by written notice to the Trustee and the Security Trustee delivered prior
to the automatic release and discharge of any such Lien as specified above, to (i) waive such automatic
release and discharge of such Lien and maintain such Lien in effect until such time as the Company shall
instruct and direct the Security Trustee in writing to release and discharge such Lien or (ii) elect that the
release and discharge of such Lien shall not occur automatically as contemplated by this paragraph but shall
occur at such time or times, in such manner and order and upon the occurrence of such other events as
shall be specified by the Company in such notice to the Trustee and the Security Trustee (and the Trustee
and the Security Trustee, at the request of the Company, shall execute and deliver any document requested
by the Company to effect and evidence the release and discharge of such Lien); provided further that nothing
in this clause (ii) shall allow the Company to require the release and discharge of any Lien prior to (unless
such release and discharge is to occur substantially concurrently with) the occurrence of the applicable event(s)
set forth in clauses (a) through (g) above providing for the release and discharge thereof.

For purposes of determining compliance with any Euro-denominated restriction on the incurrence
of any Lien where the Indebtedness secured by such Lien is denominated in a different currency, the
amount of such Indebtedness shall be the Euro Equivalent determined on the date of such determination;
_provided, however, that if any such Indebtedness is Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency_
and is subject to a Currency Hedging Agreement (with respect to Euro) covering principal amounts
payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in Euro shall be adjusted to take
into account the effect of such agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this “—Limitation on
_Liens” covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness secured by any Lien that the Company or any of its_
Restricted Subsidiaries may incur pursuant to this “—Limitation on Liens” covenant shall not be deemed
to be exceeded, with respect to any outstanding Indebtedness, due solely to the result of fluctuations in the
exchange rates of currencies (and such Indebtedness will be permitted to be refinanced with other secured
Indebtedness notwithstanding that, after giving effect to such refinancing, such excess shall continue).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any determinations and calculations pursuant to this paragraph in connection
with any Limited Condition Transaction or any related transaction shall be subject to paragraph (a) of
“—Certain Calculations”).

**_Limitation on Sale of Assets_**

(a) The Company will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to,
directly or indirectly, consummate an Asset Sale unless:

(1) at least 75% of the consideration from such Asset Sale or series of related Asset
Sales is received (A) in cash, cash equivalents or Temporary Cash Investments or
(B) in the form of the assumption by the purchaser of liabilities of the Company or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (other than liabilities (or guarantees thereof)
that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes or Guarantees) as a result of
which the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries are no longer obligated with
respect to such liabilities; and


-----

(2) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary receives consideration at the time of
such Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value of the properties or assets
subject to such Asset Sale.

(b) Within 540 days after the receipt of any Net Cash Proceeds from an Asset Sale
consummated after the Issue Date, the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries may
apply all or a portion of such Net Cash Proceeds (at the option of the Company or any
such Restricted Subsidiary):

(1) to invest in properties and other assets (including Capital Stock) that (as
determined by the Board of Directors or senior management of the Company)
replace the properties and assets (including Capital Stock) that were the subject of
such Asset Sale or in properties and assets that will be used in or are related to
the businesses of the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries existing on the Issue
Date or prior to such Asset Sale;

(2) to either (i) purchase the Euro Notes or the Dollar Notes or any other series of
Additional Notes issued under the Indenture pursuant to an offer to all holders of
such series of Notes at a purchase price equal to or greater than 100% of the
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but not including)
the date of purchase (a “Notes Offer”) and/or (ii) redeem the Euro Notes or the
Dollar Notes or any other series of Additional Notes on a pro rata basis pursuant
to the redemption provisions set forth above under the caption “—Optional
_Redemption”;_

(3) to repurchase, prepay, redeem, repay or otherwise acquire for value (A) any
Indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the 2028 Senior Secured
Notes, the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes
or the 2025 Senior Secured Notes (or, in each case, any Permitted Refinancing
Indebtedness in respect thereof) or (B) any Pari Passu Indebtedness that is secured
by a Permitted Collateral Lien on the properties or assets that are the subject of
such Asset Sale that ranks equal to or prior to any Lien thereon securing the Notes,
any Guarantee or the Indenture;

(4) to repurchase, prepay, redeem, repay or otherwise acquire for value Indebtedness
that is (or, immediately prior to such Asset Sale, was) secured by a Lien (other than
a Permitted Collateral Lien (except a Permitted Collateral Lien referred to in
clause (k) of the definition of such term)) on any of the properties or assets which
are the subject of such Asset Sale;

(5) to repurchase, prepay, redeem, repay or otherwise acquire for value any
Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary that is not Pari Passu
Indebtedness or Subordinated Indebtedness; or

(6) pursuant to a binding commitment (including pursuant to an offer to purchase)
to apply such Net Cash Proceeds in a manner described in any of clauses (1) through
(5) above; provided that such binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted
application of such Net Cash Proceeds from the date of such commitment until the
earlier of (A) the date on which such application of such Net Cash Proceeds
occurs and (B) the 180th day following the expiration of the aforementioned
540-day period.

The amount of Net Cash Proceeds not applied as specified above within such 540-day
period shall constitute “Excess Proceeds”. Pending the final application of the Net Cash
Proceeds of any Asset Sale, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary may temporarily
reduce Indebtedness, invest such Net Cash Proceeds in Temporary Cash Investments or
otherwise use such Net Cash Proceeds for general corporate purposes.

(c) When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds the greater of (x) €100.0 million
and (y) 1.00% of Total Assets, the Company (or another Restricted Subsidiary on the
Company’s behalf) will apply the Excess Proceeds to the repurchase, prepayment,
redemption, repayment or acquisition for value of Indebtedness under the Notes and any
_Pari Passu Indebtedness secured by a Permitted Collateral Lien that ranks equal to or prior_


-----

to any Lien on the applicable assets securing the Notes (which, solely for the purposes of
this clause (c), shall be deemed to include any Permitted Receivables Financing) outstanding
with similar provisions requiring the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary to make an
offer to repurchase, prepay, redeem, repay or acquire for value such Indebtedness with the
proceeds from any Asset Sale as follows:

(1) the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary will make an offer to purchase (an “Asset
**Sale Offer”) from all holders of the Notes in accordance with the procedures set**
forth in the Indenture in respect of an aggregate maximum principal amount of
Notes (expressed as a multiple of €1,000, in the case of the Euro Notes, or
$1,000, in the case of the Dollar Notes) (the “Note Amount”) equal to the product
of such Excess Proceeds multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
outstanding principal amount of the Notes, and the denominator of which is the
sum of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes and such Pari Passu
Indebtedness (subject to proration in the event the Note Amount is less than the
aggregate Offered Price (as defined herein) of all Notes tendered);

(2) to the extent required by such Pari Passu Indebtedness to permanently reduce the
principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, will make an offer to repurchase, prepay, redeem,
repay or otherwise acquire for value such Pari Passu Indebtedness (a “Pari
**_Passu Offer”) in an amount (the “Pari Passu Debt Amount”) equal to the excess of_**
the Excess Proceeds over the Note Amount; provided that in no event will the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary be required to make a Pari Passu Offer in a
_Pari Passu Debt Amount exceeding the principal amount of such Pari Passu_
Indebtedness plus the amount of any premium required to be paid to repurchase
such Pari Passu Indebtedness; and

(3) the offer price for the Notes will be payable in cash in an amount equal to 100%
of the principal amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the
date (the “Offer Date”) such Asset Sale Offer is consummated (the “Offered
**Price”), in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture.**

To the extent that the aggregate Offered Price of the Notes tendered pursuant to the Asset
Sale Offer is less than the Note Amount relating thereto or the aggregate amount of Pari
_Passu Indebtedness that is repurchased, prepaid, redeemed, repaid or otherwise acquired for_
value in a Pari Passu Offer is less than the Pari Passu Debt Amount, the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate
purposes, including reinvesting in assets useful to the business of the Restricted Group. If
the aggregate principal amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by
holders thereof exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Company shall select the Notes
to be purchased on a pro rata basis, unless otherwise required by applicable law or
applicable stock exchange or depositary requirements. Upon the completion of the
purchase of all the Notes tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer and the completion of
a Pari Passu Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds, if any, shall be reset at zero.

The Issuer, the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, may make an
Asset Sale Offer prior to the expiration of the 540-day period referred to in paragraph (b)
above.

(d) If the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary becomes obligated to make an Asset Sale Offer
pursuant to paragraph (c) above, the Notes and the Pari Passu Indebtedness shall be
purchased by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, at the option of the holders thereof,
in whole or in part (in a principal amount of €100,000, in the case of the Euro Notes, or
$200,000, in the case of the Dollar Notes) or an integral multiple of €1,000 or $1,000, as
applicable, in excess thereof, such that no Euro Note of less than €100,000 and no Dollar
Note of less than $200,000 remains outstanding thereafter) on a date that is not earlier
than 30 days and not later than 60 days from the date the notice of the Asset Sale Offer is
given to holders, or such later date as may be necessary for the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary to comply with the requirements under the U.S. Exchange Act or other
applicable laws or regulations (including, without limitation, those of any securities
exchange on which the Notes are listed).


-----

(e) If the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary is required to make an Asset Sale Offer or
makes a Notes Offer, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as applicable, will comply
with the applicable tender offer rules, including Rule 14e-1 under the U.S. Exchange Act,
and any other applicable securities laws or regulations, including administrative
interpretations thereof (including those of the United States and the United Kingdom, to
the extent applicable), in connection with such Asset Sale Offer or Notes Offer. To the
extent that the provisions of any applicable securities laws or regulations conflict with the
provisions of this covenant (other than the obligation to make an Asset Sale Offer pursuant
to this covenant), the Company and such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, will
comply with the securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its
obligations described in this covenant by virtue thereof.

(f) If the Offer Date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest
payment date, any accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name
a Note is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest
will be payable to holders of the Notes who tender Notes pursuant to the Asset Sale
Offer or Notes Offer.

(g) Compliance with paragraph (a) of this covenant shall be determined as of the date of
consummation of the applicable Asset Sale, without giving effect to any post-closing
purchase price adjustments not then determined, and for purposes of sub-clause (1) thereof,
the following will be deemed to be cash:

(1) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary from the transferee that are converted by the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary into cash, cash equivalents or Temporary Cash Investments
within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Sale;

(2) liabilities of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as
a result of such Asset Sale, provided that the Company and each other Restricted
Subsidiary of the Company are released from any guarantee of payment of such
liabilities in connection with such Asset Sale;

(3) consideration consisting of liabilities of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
(other than Subordinated Indebtedness) received after the Issue Date from
Persons that are not the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) any properties and assets (including Capital Stock of a business) of the kind
referred to in clause (b)(1) above; and

(5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate Fair Market Value,
taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received
pursuant to this covenant that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed (for the
avoidance of doubt, with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated
Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving
effect to subsequent changes in value) the greater of (x) €475.0 million and
(y) 5.00% of Total Assets.

**_Limitation on Issuance of Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries_**

(a) The Company will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary (which is not a Guarantor
or the Issuer), directly or indirectly, to guarantee (i) any Indebtedness of the Issuer or any
Guarantor under any Credit Facilities or (ii) any Public Debt (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, any guarantee of Public Debt) of the Issuer or any Guarantor, in each case,
unless such Restricted Subsidiary (if not the Issuer or a Guarantor) simultaneously executes
and delivers a supplemental indenture to the Indenture providing for a Guarantee of the
Notes on the same terms (subject to any applicable Guarantee limitations) as the other
Guarantees of the Notes by the Guarantors; provided that:

(1) no Guarantee shall be required as a result of any guarantee of Indebtedness that
existed at the time such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary if the guarantee was
not incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such Person becoming a
Restricted Subsidiary;


-----

(2) no Guarantee shall be required as a result of any guarantee in connection with a
Permitted Receivables Financing or any inventory financing or similar arrangement;

(3) such Guarantee need not be secured unless required pursuant to the “—Limitation
_on Liens” covenant;_

(4) if such Indebtedness is by its terms expressly subordinated to the Notes or any
Guarantee, any such guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary of such Indebtedness
shall be subordinated to such Restricted Subsidiary’s Guarantee of the Notes at
least to the same extent as such Indebtedness is subordinated to the Notes or any
other Guarantee;

(5) no Guarantee shall be required as a result of any guarantee given in connection
with any Cash Management Arrangement of the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary;

(6) no Guarantee shall be required under this covenant if such Guarantee would not
be required under the Security Principles, including if such Guarantee could
reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in (A) personal, whether civil or
criminal, liability for any officers, directors, legal representatives or shareholders
of such Restricted Subsidiary, (B) any violation of applicable law that cannot be
avoided or otherwise prevented through measures reasonably available to the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary or (C) any significant cost, expense,
liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable
out of pocket expenses and other than reasonable expenses incurred in connection
with any governmental or regulatory filings required as a result of, or any
measures pursuant to clause (B) undertaken in connection with, such Guarantee,
which cannot be avoided through measures reasonably available to the Company or
such Restricted Subsidiary (it being understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that
the cost of providing a Guarantee shall in any event be deemed to be significant and
unreasonable (and such Guarantee shall not be required to be provided) if the
cost shall exceed the realizable value of such Guarantee); and

(7) each such Guarantee will be limited as set forth in or contemplated by the
Indenture and the Security Principles, including as necessary to recognize certain
defenses generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent
conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate
purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, rules or regulations or defenses
affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable
law.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Guarantee by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company
created pursuant to paragraph (a) above will be deemed to provide by its terms that it
shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged, without any action by
the Trustee, the Security Trustee or the holders of the Notes, upon:

(1) any sale, exchange or transfer, directly or indirectly, to any Person that is not the
Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, of all of the Capital Stock held by
the Company and other Restricted Subsidiaries in, or all or substantially all the
assets of, such Restricted Subsidiary (which sale, exchange or transfer is not
prohibited by the Indenture) and such Restricted Subsidiary is released from all
guarantees, if any, by it of other Credit Facilities and Public Debt of the Company
or any Restricted Subsidiaries;

(2) with respect to any Guarantee created after the Issue Date, the release by the
holders of the Credit Facilities and Public Debt of the Issuer or any Guarantor
described in paragraph (a) above of their guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary
at such time as (A) no other Credit Facility or Public Debt of the Issuer or any
Guarantor has been guaranteed by such Restricted Subsidiary or (B) the holders
of all other Credit Facilities and Public Debt of the Issuer or any Guarantor which
is guaranteed by such Restricted Subsidiary also release their guarantee by such
Restricted Subsidiary;


-----

(3) any defeasance or discharge of the Notes as provided in “—Defeasance or
_Covenant Defeasance of Indenture” or “—Satisfaction and Discharge”; or_

(4) the satisfaction of the requirements of any of the other provisions described
under the caption “—Brief Description of the Notes, the Guarantees and the
_Security—The Guarantees—Release of the Guarantees”;_

_provided, however, that the Company shall have the right, in its sole discretion, by written_
notice to the Trustee delivered prior to the automatic release and discharge of any such
Guarantee as specified above, to (A) waive such automatic release and discharge of such
Guarantee and maintain such Guarantee in effect until such time as the Company shall
instruct and direct the Trustee in writing to release and discharge such Guarantee or (B) elect
that the release and discharge of such Guarantee shall not occur automatically as
contemplated by this paragraph (b) but shall occur at such time or times, in such manner
and order and upon the occurrence of such other events as shall be specified by the Company
in such notice to the Trustee (and the Trustee, at the request of the Company, shall
execute and deliver any document requested by the Company to effect and evidence the
release of such Guarantee); provided further that nothing in this clause (B) shall allow the
Company to require the release and discharge of any Guarantee prior to (unless such release
and discharge is to occur substantially concurrently with) the occurrence of the applicable
event(s) set forth in clauses (1) through (4) above providing for the release and discharge
thereof.

**_Limitation on Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries_**

(a) The Company will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to,
directly or indirectly, create or otherwise cause to exist or become effective any consensual
encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(1) pay dividends or make any other distribution on its Capital Stock or any other
interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits to the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary;

(2) pay any Indebtedness owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(3) make any loans or advances to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(4) transfer any of its properties or assets to the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary;

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating_
distributions prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock
and (y) the subordination of (including the application of any standstill requirements to)
any Indebtedness owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness
incurred by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute
such an encumbrance or restriction.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in paragraph (a) above, the provisions of such
paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (A) the Senior Secured Term Loans
Agreement, any LC Facility, the 2028 Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the
March 2026 Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, the 2025 Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Indenture, other Senior
Secured Notes Documents (as defined in the Intercreditor Deed), any High Yield
Documents, the Intercreditor Deed, the Proceeds Loans Documents and the
other Notes Documents, (B) any other agreement in effect on the Issue Date and
(C) any indenture for any Public Debt of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(2) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary that is not
a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company on the Issue Date in existence at the
time such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company and not
incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such Person becoming a
Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such encumbrances and restrictions are not


-----

applicable to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or the properties or
assets of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary other than such Person (and
its properties or assets or Capital Stock) that is becoming a Restricted Subsidiary;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a
Person or relating to any Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person which is
assumed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with any
Acquisition or any other acquisition of assets (other than Capital Stock or
Indebtedness incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any portion of the

**_Limitation on Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

The Company may designate after the Issue Date (a “Designation”) any Subsidiary of the Company
(other than the Issuer) as an Unrestricted Subsidiary under the Indenture; provided that:

(a) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of or after giving
effect to such Designation or would occur as a consequence of such Designation;

(b) either (i) the Subsidiary to be so designated has total assets of €1,000 or less or (ii) the
Company would be permitted to make a Restricted Payment, Permitted Payment or


-----

Permitted Investment at the time of such Designation (assuming the effectiveness of such
Designation) pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted
_Payments” in an amount (the “Designation Amount”) equal to the greater of (1) the net_
book value of the Company’s interest in such Subsidiary calculated in accordance with
IFRS and (2) the Fair Market Value of the Company’s interest in such Subsidiary;

(c) such Subsidiary does not own directly or indirectly any Capital Stock of the Company or
any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company which is not simultaneously being designated an
Unrestricted Subsidiary; and

(d) such Subsidiary is not a party to any agreement, contract, arrangement or understanding
at the time of such Designation with the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than
any Restricted Subsidiary that is to be simultaneously designated as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary) unless (i) the terms of any such agreement, contract, arrangement or
understanding are no less favorable in any material respect to the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary than those that might be obtained at the time from Persons that are
not Affiliates of the Company or would be permitted under the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates” or (ii) to the extent the requirements of
clause (i) above are not satisfied, the value of such agreement, contract, arrangement or
understanding to such Unrestricted Subsidiary (to the extent, for the avoidance of doubt,
not already included in the Designation Amount) shall be deemed a Restricted Payment.

For purposes of the foregoing, the Designation of a Subsidiary of the Company as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be the Designation of all of the Subsidiaries of such Subsidiary as Unrestricted
Subsidiaries.

In the event of any Designation, unless sub-clause (i) of clause (b) of the first paragraph of this
covenant applies, the Company will be deemed to have made an Investment in an amount equal to the
Designation Amount.

The Company will not and will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a
guarantee of, or subject any of its property or assets (other than the Capital Stock of any Unrestricted
Subsidiary) to the satisfaction of, any Indebtedness of any Unrestricted Subsidiary, in each case, except to
the extent permitted under the covenants described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Limitation
_on Restricted Payments.”_

The Company may redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary (a
“Redesignation”) if:

(a) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of and after giving
effect to such Redesignation or would occur as a consequence of such Redesignation; and

(b) all Liens and Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary outstanding immediately
following such Redesignation would, if incurred at such time, have been permitted to be
incurred for all purposes of the Indenture.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Parent and the Company will not, and the Company will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary
to, take or knowingly or negligently omit to take any action which action or omission would have the result
of materially impairing the security interests with respect to the Collateral for the benefit of the Trustee
and the holders of the Notes, and the Parent and the Company shall not, and the Company shall not permit
any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Trustee or the Trustee, for the
benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes and the other beneficiaries described in the Security
Documents, any Lien whatsoever on any of the Collateral, in each case, except as otherwise permitted by the
Indenture (including pursuant to the following paragraph or as described under “—Suspension of Covenants
_and Release of Guarantees on Achievement of Investment Grade Status” or “Brief Description of the Notes,_
_the Guarantees and the Security—Security—Release of Security”) or the Security Documents, including_
(i) the grant of any Permitted Collateral Liens or any other Lien that is not prohibited by the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Liens”, (ii) the implementation of any transaction that is subject to the
covenant described under the caption “—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets” and is completed in
compliance therewith, (iii) the implementation of any transaction as part of a Permitted Reorganization and
(iv) any sale, transfer or other disposition of Collateral that is permitted by the covenant described under


-----

“—Limitation on Sale of Assets” or that does not constitute an Asset Sale under the definition thereof;
_provided that in the case of any sale, transfer or other disposition, other than in the ordinary course of_
business, by the Issuer or any Guarantor to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of any assets
that constitute Collateral and that are material to the business and operations of the Issuer or such
Guarantor, unless (A) the transferee thereof would be permitted, were it a Guarantor, to be released from
its Guarantee pursuant to clause (a), (b), (c), (d) and (g) under the caption “—Brief Description of the Notes,
_the Guarantees and the Security—Release of the Guarantees”, (B) the transferee thereof would be permitted,_
were it a Guarantor, to be released from its Guarantee pursuant to clause (i) under the caption “—Brief
_Description of the Notes, the Guarantees and the Security—Release of the Guarantees” if the calculations set_
forth therein were redetermined on a pro forma basis to give effect to such sale, transfer or other deposition
or (C) the release of Liens on such assets would be permitted under clause (d), (e), (f), (k), (s), (t) or (u) under
the caption “—Brief Description of the Notes, the Guarantees and the Security—Security—Release of
_Security”, then either the transferee thereof shall have granted or shall grant, substantially concurrently_
with such sale, transfer or other disposition, a Lien on such Collateral to the Security Trustee for the benefit
of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes or an existing Lien on such Collateral in favor of the Security
Trustee for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes shall remain in effect immediately after
such sale, transfer or other disposition, subject to any subsequent release thereof as provided under the caption
“—Brief Description of the Notes, the Guarantees and the Security—Security—Release of Security”.

At the request of the Company from time to time, the Trustee and the Security Trustee shall, and
will be deemed to have been irrevocably authorized and directed by the holders of the Notes to, in each
case on behalf of such holders and without any further consent, authorization or other action by such
holders, execute and deliver one or more amendments, supplements or other modifications to the Security
Documents to:

minor, technical or administrative nature;

(ii) provide for Permitted Collateral Liens;

(iii) add to the Collateral;

caption “—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets”;

(v) implement any transaction as part of a Permitted Reorganization (including any such
change to any Security Document to provide for upstream security and guarantees or
security and guarantees over or in favor of Proceeds Loans);

(vi) provide for the release of any properties and assets constituting Collateral from the Liens
created under the Security Documents; provided that such release is followed by the
substantially concurrent (as determined in good faith by the Company, it being agreed
that in making such determination the Company may take into account the occurrence of
any related transactions and that the re-taking need not occur on the same day as the release)
re-taking (irrespective of the Security Principles) of a Lien in favor of the Security
Trustee, for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes, securing the Notes
and/or the applicable Guarantees, as the case may be, on such properties or assets of at least
equivalent priority (subject to any Liens thereon permitted under the Indenture); provided
_further that, in the case of this clause (vi), the Company will deliver to the Trustee either_
(1) a solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, from
an accounting, appraisal or investment banking firm of national standing confirming
the solvency of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving
effect to any transactions relating to such release and/or re-taking, (2) a certificate
substantially in the form of an exhibit attached to the Indenture from the chief financial
officer or the Board of Directors of the Company (acting in good faith) which confirms the
solvency of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving
effect to any transactions relating to such release and re-taking or (3) an opinion of counsel,
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee (subject to customary
exceptions and qualifications), confirming that, after giving effect to any such transactions,
the Lien or Liens securing the Notes and/or the applicable Guarantees created under the

applicable Security Documents are valid and perfected Liens not otherwise subject to any
limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, to which such Lien or
Liens were not otherwise subject immediately prior to such release and re-taking;

(vii) (A) provide for the release of the Liens on any Proceeds Loans upon the payment in full
or other discharge or repurchase or redemption of such Proceeds Loans (including as a
result of any merger, consolidation or amalgamation of the payor or the payee thereunder)
(and the release of the Liens on any amounts so repaid or discharged) or (B) with respect
to any repayment, defeasance, satisfaction, cancellation or other discharge of all or any
portion of the underlying Indebtedness giving rise to any Proceeds Loans, provide for
the repayments, defeasance, satisfaction, cancellation or other discharge of such Proceeds
Loans, provided that any amount remaining under such Proceeds Loan after such
repayments, defeasance, satisfaction, cancellation or discharge remains subject to a valid
Lien;

(viii) make any other change to the Security Documents to provide for additional Indebtedness
(which may be Pari Passu Indebtedness or Subordinated Indebtedness) or other obligations
that are permitted by the terms of the Indenture to be secured by a Lien on the Collateral
on a senior, pari passu or junior basis with the Liens securing the Notes or the Guarantees,
including changes to the definition of the term “Secured Obligations” in the Security
Documents (or any other term, however described, relating to the obligations of the
Company, the Guarantors and the Restricted Subsidiaries of the Company that are subject
to the security interest created therein); provided that, in the case of this clause (viii), the
Company shall deliver to the Trustee either (1) a solvency opinion, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee from an accounting, appraisal or investment banking
firm of national standing confirming the solvency of the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions relating to such change,
(2) a certificate substantially in the form of an exhibit attached to the Indenture from the
chief financial officer or the Board of Directors of the Company (acting in good faith)
which confirms the solvency of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, after giving effect to the transactions relating to such change or (3) an opinion of
counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee (subject to customary
exceptions and qualifications), confirming that, after giving effect to the transactions
relating to such change, the Lien or Liens securing the Notes and/or the applicable
Guarantees created under the applicable Security Documents are valid and perfected Liens
not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity
or at law, to which such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject immediately prior to such
transactions;

(ix) amend or otherwise modify any Security Document to the extent necessary (A) to
conform any restriction or limitation contained therein to any analogous restriction or
limitation contained in the Indenture or to eliminate any restriction or limitation therein
that is not contained in the Indenture except to the extent such restriction or limitation is
necessary to create, perfect, preserve or enforce the security interest in the Collateral
purported to be created by such Security Document, (B) to conform to the Security
Principles or the security principles under the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement (“SFA
**Security Principles”) (including any amendment or other modification to exclude from**
the Liens created or purported to be created by such Security Document any assets that, in
accordance with the Security Principles or the SFA Security Principles, would not or
would no longer be required to be subject to such Liens (it being understood and agreed
that such exclusion may provide that its effectiveness is delayed until the satisfaction of any
requirement set forth on the Security Principles or the SFA Security Principles that must
be satisfied in order for such assets to not be required, in accordance with the Security
Principles or the SFA Security Principles, to be subject to such Liens)), (C) to amend,
supplement or modify any one or more Security Documents to eliminate or reduce
administrative burdens imposed on the Parent, the Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries by (i) eliminating, reducing the frequency of or delaying the timing of notices
or other informational requirements, (ii) limiting representations and covenants and
undertakings in the Security Documents to those necessary for the creation, perfection or
maintenance of the security and excluding such representations and covenants and
undertakings to the extent that the subject matter thereof is the same as the corresponding

covenant or undertaking in the Indenture or the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement;
_provided that (x) representations (to the extent included) need only be given as of the date of_
the relevant Security Document and (y) representations, covenants and undertakings may
be included to the extent consistent with applicable law and current and customary practice
in the relevant jurisdiction, in which event such representation, covenant and undertaking
shall be on the same terms as the corresponding provisions in the Indenture or the Senior
Secured Term Loans Agreement, and (iii) eliminating restrictions on any action,
transaction or other matter that is permitted or not restricted under the Notes Documents
(for the avoidance of doubt, excluding such Security Document) and any required
additional notices or consents with respect to any such action, transaction or other matter
(it being understood that nothing in this clause (iii) shall affect any such notices or
consents required under such applicable Notes Documents); provided that each of clauses
(i), (ii) and (iii) shall not apply to the extent that its application would adversely affect the
validity, ranking, priority or enforceability of, or materially adversely affect the ability to
take enforcement over, the security interest(s) created under such Security Document (other
than any such security interests that, in accordance with the Security Principles or the
SFA Security Principles, would not have been required to be created), in each case, as
determined by the Company in good faith or (D) to amend, supplement or modify any one
or more Security Documents to the extent necessary or appropriate to eliminate any
conflict or inconsistency between provisions of the Security Documents and those of any
other Note Document;

(x) make any other change thereto that does not adversely affect the holders of the Notes in
any material respect; or

(xi) effect or confirm transfers of Collateral permitted under the first paragraph of this
covenant.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Security Document may be amended and no waiver of any of
the requirements of, or granting of any consent under, any Security Document may be made unless any
such amendment, waiver or consent applies equally to all holders of the Notes. In the event of any action
under this covenant, the consent of the Trustee, the Security Trustee or the holders of the Notes shall not be
required, but each of the Trustee and the Security Trustee shall be entitled to receive, if requested, an
indemnity and/or security (including by way of prefunding) reasonably satisfactory to it in connection with
such action.

**_Intercreditor Deed; Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Security Trustee is a party to the Intercreditor Deed and the Trustee will become a party to the
Intercreditor Deed by executing an accession and/or amendment deed thereto on or about the Issue Date,

At the request of the Company, at the time of, or prior to, the incurrence or establishment of any
Indebtedness or other obligations that are permitted to be secured by Liens on the Collateral pursuant to
the definition of Permitted Collateral Liens, the Trustee and the Security Trustee shall, and by accepting a
Note, each holder of the Notes shall be deemed to have irrevocably authorized and directed the Trustee and
the Security Trustee to, in each case on behalf of such holder and without any further consent, authorization
or other action by such holder, execute and deliver (i) an additional intercreditor agreement (A) on terms that
are substantially the same as those contained in the Intercreditor Deed (or terms that are no less favorable
to the holders of the Notes) and/or (B) in the case of any inventory financing or similar arrangement, on
terms that are within the range of terms and conditions customary for intercreditor agreements that are
of the type that govern intercreditor relationships between providers of inventory financings or similar
arrangements, on the one hand, and holders of Public Debt, on the other hand, and do not materially impair
the rights of the holders of the Notes in respect of payment or enforcement, in each case as determined in
good faith by the Company and consented to by the Trustee (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned, it being understood that in providing such consent the Trustee may conclusively
rely on an Officer’s Certificate of the Company setting forth its determination set forth above) or (ii) an
accession and/or amendment to the Intercreditor Deed to permit such Indebtedness or other obligations to

and Guarantees, enforcement of security interests, turnover, limitations on enforcement and other rights and
limitations of the creditors of Senior Secured Indebtedness or Subordinated Indebtedness, as applicable,
as those contained in the Intercreditor Deed (or, in the case of any such terms, terms that are no less favorable
to the holders of the Notes), it being understood and agreed, in each case, that the execution and delivery
by the Trustee and the Security Trustee of any such additional intercreditor agreement or any such accession
or amendment shall be conclusive evidence of the satisfaction of the foregoing requirements as to the
terms thereof.

At the request of the Company from time to time, the Trustee and Security Trustee shall, and by
accepting a Note, each holder of the Notes shall be deemed to have irrevocably authorized and directed the
Trustee and the Security Trustee to, in each case on behalf of such holder and without any further consent,
authorization or other action by such holder, execute and deliver one or more amendments, supplements or

repayment, defeasance, satisfaction, cancellation or other discharge of the corresponding
Indebtedness giving rise thereto and (C) the cancellation and discharge of any Guarantor

respect except as otherwise permitted by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Deed (or any
such other intercreditor agreement); or

(xiii) permit payments to be made to the Issuer that would not otherwise have been permitted
pursuant to the terms thereof.

The Company will not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Trustee to enter into any
amendment, supplement or other modification to the Intercreditor Deed and any other intercreditor
agreement contemplated by the Indenture without the consent of the holders of a majority in principal
amount of the outstanding Notes, other than any such amendment, supplement or other modification that,

accepting such Notes, be deemed to have given its prior consent to such Permitted Action and to have
authorized each of the Trustee and the Security Trustee to execute and deliver such document as the
Company may request confirming such consent; provided that this paragraph shall be without prejudice to
and shall not affect the rights and obligations under clause 11 (Stop Events and Payment Blockage Events) of
the Intercreditor Deed. In this paragraph, capitalized words and expressions shall have the meaning given
them in the Intercreditor Deed.

_provided further that if the SEC has granted generally to non-accelerated filers an_

-----

(3) promptly after the occurrence of any acquisition, disposition or restructuring that is
material to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any senior
executive officer changes at the Parent or the Issuer or change in auditors of the Parent or
the Issuer or any other material event that the Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
announces publicly, a report containing a description of such event.

Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee shall be for informational
purposes only and the Trustee’s receipt of such shall not constitute actual or constructive notice of any
information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Company’s
compliance with any of its covenants under the Indenture or the Notes (as to which the Trustee shall be
entitled to rely exclusively on Officer’s Certificates).

All financial statements and pro forma financial information will be prepared in accordance with
IFRS on a consistent basis for the periods presented; provided, however, that the reports set forth in
clauses (1) and (2) above may, in the event of a change in applicable IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis
that applied to such periods, subject to the provisions of the Indenture. Except as provided for above, no
report need include separate financial statements for Subsidiaries of the Parent or any disclosure with respect
to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in this
offering memorandum. For the purposes of this covenant, IFRS shall be deemed to be IFRS as in effect
from time to time, without giving effect to the proviso in the definition thereof.

Contemporaneously with the furnishing of each such report discussed above, the Company will
also post such report on the Parent’s website. In the event that the Parent becomes subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the U.S. Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, the
Parent will, for so long as it continues to file the reports required by Section 13(a) or 15(d) with the SEC,
make available to the Trustee the annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Parent
is required to file with the SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d). Upon complying with the foregoing
requirement, the Parent will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding three
paragraphs.

The Indenture will also provide that, so long as any of the Notes remain outstanding, the Parent
will make available to any prospective purchaser of Notes or beneficial owner of Notes in connection with
any sale thereof the information required by Rule 144A(d)(4) under the U.S. Securities Act. The Parent and
the Issuer will also make any of the foregoing information available during normal business hours at the
offices of the listing agent in Luxembourg if and so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF Market thereof and the rules of the
stock exchange so require.

**_Listing_**

Each of the Company and the Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain on or
prior to the first interest payment date a listing of the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange and the admission of the Notes to trading on the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange, and use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain such listing for so long as such Notes
are outstanding; provided that if at any time the Issuer determines that it will not seek or maintain such listing,
it will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, prior to the first interest payment date or prior to the
delisting of the Notes from the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange for trading on the Euro MTF
Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, a listing of such Notes on another “recognised stock
exchange” as defined in section 1005 of the United Kingdom Income Tax Act 2007 (the “ITA”) for the
purposes of section 987 of the ITA, or the admission of such Notes to trading on a “multilateral trading
facility”operated by a “regulated recognised stock exchange”(within the meaning of section 987 of the ITA).

**_Limitation on Parent and Parent Intermediate Holdcos Activities_**

Notwithstanding anything contained in the Indenture:

(1) neither the Parent nor any Parent Intermediate Holdco will engage in any business
activity, except any such activity (i) reasonably relating to the offering, sale, issuance,
incurrence and servicing, purchase, redemption, amendment, exchange, refinancing or
retirement of the Notes or any other Indebtedness not prohibited by the Indenture or of
any Capital Stock; (ii) undertaken with the purpose of fulfilling any other obligations under
the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement, the 2028 Senior Secured Notes, the


-----

March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the 2025 Senior
Secured Notes, the Notes or other Senior Secured Notes, any High Yield Notes, the Proceeds
Loans, any Hedging Obligations or any agreements or instruments relating to any other
Indebtedness or other obligations not prohibited by the Indenture, including any Proceeds
Loan or any guarantees or Liens relating to any of the foregoing; (iii) involving the
provision of administrative services (including treasury services), human resources
functions and other corporate and overhead services to its Subsidiaries of a type customarily
provided by a holding company to its Subsidiaries and the receipt of any amounts related
thereto; (iv) related to the establishment and/or maintenance of such Person’s corporate
existence or corporate activities, the acquisition, holding or disposition of assets not
prohibited to be held by it under the Indenture or reasonably related to its function as a
holding company, including, for the avoidance of doubt, (1) the participation in tax and
accounting matters as a member of the consolidated group with the Company and its
Subsidiaries, (2) the entry into, and performance of its obligations with respect to, contracts
and other arrangements with officers, directors, employees and consultants, (3) the
obtainment of, and the payment of any fees and expenses for, management, consulting,
monitoring, investment banking, advisory and other services, (4) the payment of dividends
and distributions and the purchase of Capital Stock of, and the making of capital
contributions to, its Subsidiaries and (5) preparing reports to Governmental Authorities
and complying with applicable law; (v) undertaken in connection with any Permitted
Investment, any Restricted Payment, any Permitted Payment, any Permitted Reorganization
or the Financing Transactions; or (vi) other activities not specifically enumerated above
that are immaterial in nature; and

(2) neither the Parent nor any Parent Intermediate Holdco will own any assets or property
other than (i) Capital Stock of another Parent Intermediate Holdco, any Financing
Subsidiary or the Company, (ii) intercompany Indebtedness, (iii) any rights under any
contract or agreement, provided that the Parent or such Parent Intermediate Holdco shall
remain in compliance with the preceding clause (1), (iv) any cash, cash equivalents or
Temporary Cash Investments, (v) any assets and properties arising from activities of the
Parent or any Parent Intermediate Holdco undertaken in compliance with the preceding
clause (1) and (vi) other assets and properties that are immaterial in nature; provided that
each of the Parent and any Parent Intermediate Holdco may from time to time receive in
a transaction otherwise permitted under the Indenture and the Security Documents
properties and assets (including cash, cash equivalents, Temporary Cash Investments,
shares of Capital Stock of another Person and/or Indebtedness and other obligations) for
the purpose of transferring such properties and assets to any Parent Holdco, any
Subsidiary or any other Person, so long as in any case such further transfer is made
promptly by the Parent or such Parent Intermediate Holdco, as applicable, and, after
giving effect thereto, the Parent or such Parent Intermediate Holdco, as applicable, is in
compliance with this clause (2).

**_Concerning the Parent_**

At any time on or after the consummation of an initial Public Equity Offering, the Company may,
in its sole discretion, by written notice to the Trustee, elect that the Parent or any Parent Intermediate
Holdco (a) cease to be subject to the covenants described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Parent and Parent Intermediate Holdcos Activities” and (b) thereafter be subject to the other_
covenants set forth under the caption “—Certain Covenants” and the Events of Default set forth under the
caption “—Events of Default”, in each case, as if the Parent or such Parent Intermediate Holdco, as
applicable, were the Company. In the event the Company so elects, the Company and the Trustee shall be
deemed to be authorized by the Holders to enter into amendments to the Indenture and the other Notes
Documents as may be appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of the Company, to give effect to the provisions
of clauses (a) and (b) above (which may, if elected by the Company in its sole discretion, provide that the
Parent or the applicable Parent Intermediate Holdco (i) be added as a co-issuer under the Indenture and/or
(ii) succeed to, and be substituted for, the Company under the Indenture and the other Notes Documents).


-----

**_Limitations on Use of Proceeds_**

The net proceeds from each issue of Notes will be applied by the Issuer outside Switzerland unless

(i) use in Switzerland is permitted under the Swiss taxation laws in force from time to time or
(ii) it is confirmed in a tax ruling by the Swiss Federal Tax Administration that such use
of proceeds is permitted, in each case without payments in respect of the Notes becoming
subject to withholding or deduction for Swiss withholding tax as a consequence of such
use of proceeds in Switzerland.

**_Suspension of Covenants and Release of Guarantees on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Investment Grade Requirement shall have been satisfied
and no Default or Event of Default has then occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then,
beginning on such date and continuing until such time, if any, at which the Investment Grade Requirement
ceases to be satisfied,

(a) the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following captions will not apply to
the Notes: “—Limitation on Indebtedness”, “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”,
“—Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates”, “—Limitation on Sale of Assets”,
“—Limitation on Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries”,
the first paragraph of “—Impairment of Security Interest”, “—Limitation on Unrestricted
_Subsidiaries”, clause (c) of the covenant described under “—Consolidation, Merger and Sale_
_of Assets—The Parent, the Parent Intermediate Holdcos and the Company” and clause (c)_
of the covenant described under “—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets—Issuer” and
any related Default or Event of Default provisions of the Indenture will cease to have
any force and effect (and the Parent, the Parent Intermediate Holdcos, the Company and
its Restricted Subsidiaries shall not be required to comply therewith); and

(b) the Company shall have the right, in its sole discretion, by written notice to the Trustee
and the Security Trustee, to request the release and discharge of all Guarantees by any
Restricted Subsidiary of the Company (other than the Guarantee of any Restricted
Subsidiary that is a parent entity of the Issuer) created under the Indenture or any
supplemental indenture to the Indenture, whereupon the Trustee and the Security Trustee
shall execute and deliver any document requested by the Company to effect and evidence the
release and discharge of such Guarantees and any related release of Liens pursuant to
“—Brief Description of the Notes, the Guarantees and the Security—Security—Release of
_Security”; provided that such Guarantee shall not be released and discharged unless,_
substantially concurrently with such release and discharge, any guarantee by such Restricted
Subsidiary in respect of the SFA Term Loans shall be released and discharged and no
other Indebtedness is at that time guaranteed by the relevant Restricted Subsidiary that
would have otherwise given rise to an obligation to guarantee the Notes pursuant to the
covenant described under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Issuance of Guarantees of
_Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries” had the relevant Restricted Subsidiary not_
already been a Guarantor;

_provided further that if the Investment Grade Requirement ceases to be satisfied, then such provisions of_
the Indenture, and any related Defaults or Events of Default, will again apply in accordance with their terms
from and after the first day on which the Investment Grade Requirement ceases to be satisfied (it being
understood and agreed, however, that such provisions of the Indenture, and any related Defaults and Events
of Default, will not be of any effect with regard to actions of the Parent, any Parent Intermediate Holdco,
the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary properly taken prior thereto, and the “—Limitation on Restricted
_Payments” covenant will be interpreted as if it had been in effect since the Issue Date except that no_
Default or Event of Default will be deemed to have occurred solely by reason of a Restricted Payment
made while such covenant was suspended).

The Company shall notify the Trustee that the conditions set forth above in this covenant have
been satisfied, provided that such notification shall not be a condition for the suspension of the covenants
set forth above to be effective, nor shall failure to notify the Trustee thereof constitute a breach of this
covenant or default under the Indenture. The Trustee shall be under no obligation to notify the holders of the
Notes that the conditions set forth in this covenant have been satisfied.


-----

**_Additional Provisions_**

The Indenture will also contain provisions with respect to the following matters: (a) payment of
principal, premium, any Additional Amounts and interest; (b) maintenance of certain offices or agencies;
and (c) arrangements regarding the handling of money held in trust.

**Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets**

Subject to the provisions described under “—General” below, none of the Parent, any Parent
Intermediate Holdco or the Company will, in a single transaction or through a series of related transactions,

such Parent Intermediate Holdco or the Company, as applicable, is the surviving Person), or sell,
assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of its properties and assets (or permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to enter into any such transaction or series of transactions) if such transaction or series of

Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, on a Consolidated basis, unless at the time of

described under “—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets”, the “Surviving
**Entity”) will be a Person duly organized and validly existing under the laws of any**
EU state which is a member of the EU on the Issue Date, the United Kingdom,

confirmed as applying to such Surviving Entity’s obligations);

(b) immediately after giving effect to such transaction on a pro forma basis (and treating any
Indebtedness not previously an obligation of the Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries which becomes the obligation of the Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries as a result of such transaction as having been incurred at the time of such
transaction), no Event of Default will have occurred and be continuing; and

(c) at the time of such transaction, the Parent, such Parent Intermediate Holdco, the Company

Subsidiaries which becomes the obligation of the Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries as a result of such transaction as having been incurred at the time of such
transaction), no Event of Default will have occurred and be continuing; and

(c) at the time of such transaction, such Subsidiary Guarantor, the Company or the Surviving

-----

**_General_**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in paragraph (b) of the subsection “—The Parent, the
_Parent Intermediate Holdcos and the Company”, paragraph (b) of the subsection “—Issuer” and_
paragraph (b) of the subsection “—Subsidiary Guarantors” (which shall not apply to transactions referred
to in this sentence), (i) any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company may consolidate or otherwise combine
with, amalgamate with, merge with or into or sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of
all or any part of its properties and assets to the Issuer, the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary and
(ii) the Parent, any Parent Intermediate Holdco, the Company or the Issuer may consolidate or otherwise
combine with, amalgamate with or merge with or into an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the primary
purpose of changing the legal domicile of the Parent, such Parent Intermediate Holdco, the Company or
the Issuer in another jurisdiction, reincorporating the Parent, such Parent Intermediate Holdco, the Company
or the Issuer in another jurisdiction or changing the legal form of the Parent, such Parent Intermediate
Holdco, the Company or the Issuer (in each case, in a jurisdiction that would be permitted under
paragraph (a)(2) under the caption “—The Parent, the Parent Intermediate Holdcos and the Company” or
paragraph (a)(2) under the caption “—Issuer”, as applicable).

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this covenant, upon the succession and
substitution of any Guarantor by any Surviving Entity in a sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or
other disposition of properties and assets subject to this covenant, upon the written request of the Company
to the Trustee, such Guarantor shall not be released and discharged from its Guarantee and shall continue
to be bound by its obligations and covenants under the Indenture and the other Notes Documents to which
it is a party as a Guarantor; provided that, in the event such Guarantor is the Parent, any Parent Intermediate
Holdco, the Company or the Issuer and to the extent provided in such request, such Guarantor shall continue
to be bound by its obligations and covenants under the Indenture and the other Notes Documents solely
in its capacity as a Guarantor and shall not be subject to or bound by any of the obligations and covenants
applicable to the Parent, a Parent Intermediate Holdco, the Company or the Issuer, as applicable, and
only the applicable Surviving Entity shall be subject to and bound by such obligations and covenants.

Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no
precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances
there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve “all or substantially
all” of the property or assets of a Person.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the Indenture and in any other Notes
Document, the Parent, any Parent Intermediate Holdco, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may
implement a Permitted Reorganization.

**Events of Default**

An Event of Default will occur under the Indenture if:

(a) there shall be a default in the payment of any interest or Additional Amounts on any Note
when it becomes due and payable, and such default shall continue for a period of 30 days;

(b) there shall be a default in the payment when due (at maturity, upon redemption or
otherwise) of the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any Note;

(c) (1) there shall be a default in the performance, or breach, of any covenant or
agreement of the Issuer or any Guarantor under the Indenture or any Guarantee
(other than a default in the performance, or breach, of a covenant or agreement
which is specifically dealt with in clause (a), (b) or in clause (2), (3) or (4) of this
clause (c)) and such default or breach shall continue for a period of 60 days
after written notice has been given, by certified mail, (x) to the Issuer by the Trustee
or (y) to the Issuer and the Trustee by the holders of at least 30% in aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Notes voting as a single class,

(2) there shall be a default in the performance or breach of the provisions described
in “—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets”,

(3) the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary shall have failed to make or consummate
an Asset Sale Offer in accordance with the provisions of “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Sale of Assets”, or_


-----

(4) the Issuer or the Company shall have failed to make or consummate a Change of
Control Offer in accordance with the provisions of “—Purchase of Notes upon a
_Change of Control”;_

(d) any default in the payment of the principal or premium, if any, on any Indebtedness shall
have occurred under any of the agreements, indentures or instruments under which the
Issuer, any Guarantor or any Significant Restricted Subsidiary then has outstanding
Indebtedness in excess of the greater of (x) €50.0 million and (y) 0.50% of Total Assets
when the same shall become due and payable in full and such default shall have continued
after any applicable grace period and shall not have been cured or waived and, if not
already matured at its final maturity in accordance with its terms, the holder of such
Indebtedness shall have accelerated such Indebtedness;

(e) any Guarantee by the Parent, the Company or a Significant Restricted Subsidiary is held
in any judicial proceeding to be unenforceable or invalid or ceases for any reason to be, or
shall for any reason be asserted in writing by any Guarantor or the Issuer not to be, in
full force and effect and enforceable in accordance with its terms, except to the extent
contemplated by the Indenture and any such Guarantee;

(f) (i) one or more of the Security Documents that, taken as a whole, create Liens on a
material portion of the Collateral shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect, or
shall be declared invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, other than,
in each case, pursuant to limitations on enforceability, validity or effectiveness imposed
by applicable law or the terms of such Security Document or except in accordance with the
terms of such Security Document, the Intercreditor Deed or the Indenture, including the
release provisions thereof, and such failure to be in full force and effect shall have continued
uncured for a period of 15 days after the Company becomes aware of such failure or
(ii) repudiation or disaffirmation by the Issuer or any Guarantor of any of their respective
obligations under the Security Documents that, taken as a whole, create Liens on a
material portion of the Collateral;

(g) one or more final judgments, orders or decrees of any court or regulatory or administrative
agency for the payment of money in excess of the greater of (x) €50.0 million and
(y) 0.50% of Total Assets, either individually or in the aggregate (to the extent not covered
by independent third-party insurance), shall be rendered against the Issuer, the Company
or any Significant Restricted Subsidiary or any of their respective properties and shall not be
discharged and there shall have been a period of 60 consecutive days during which a stay
of enforcement of such judgment or order, by reason of an appeal or otherwise, shall not be
in effect;

(h) [Reserved]; or

(i) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency described in the Indenture with respect to the
Parent, the Company, the Issuer or any Significant Restricted Subsidiary shall have occurred.

If an Event of Default (other than as specified in clause (i) of the prior paragraph) shall occur and
be continuing with respect to the Indenture, the Trustee or the holders of not less than 30% in aggregate
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may, and the Trustee, at the request of such holders, shall
declare all unpaid principal of, premium, if any, any Additional Amounts and accrued interest on all Notes to
be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by the
holders of the Notes) and upon any such declaration, such principal, premium, if any, any Additional
Amounts and interest shall become due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default specified in clause
(i) of the prior paragraph occurs and is continuing, then all the Notes shall ipso facto (to the fullest extent
permitted by law) become and be due and payable immediately in an amount equal to the principal amount
of the Notes, together with any Additional Amounts and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date
the Notes become due and payable, without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any
holder. Thereupon, the Trustee may, at its discretion, proceed to protect and enforce the rights of the holders
of the Notes by appropriate judicial proceedings. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the
Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (d) of the prior paragraph has occurred and is
continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default
or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (d) shall be remedied or cured, or
waived by the holders of the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default, or such Indebtedness shall


-----

be discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the
annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of
competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except non-payment of principal, premium
or interest on the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or
waived.

After a declaration of acceleration, but before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due
has been obtained by the Trustee, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of Notes
outstanding by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee may rescind an acceleration and annul such
declaration and its consequences under the Indenture if:

(a) the Issuer has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay:

(1) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee under the Indenture and the properly
incurred compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its
agents and counsel,

(2) all overdue interest and Additional Amounts on all Notes then outstanding,

(3) the principal of and premium, if any, on any Notes then-outstanding which have
become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest thereon
at the rate borne by the Notes, and

(4) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue
interest at the rate borne by the Notes;

(b) the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction; and

(c) all Events of Default, other than the non-payment of principal of, premium, if any, and
any Additional Amounts and interest on the Notes, which have become due solely by such
declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in the Indenture. No
such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.

The holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Notes
may, by written notice to the Trustee, on behalf of the holders of all outstanding Notes, waive any past
default under the Indenture and its consequences, except a default in respect of a covenant or provision
hereof which under the Indenture cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the holders of not
less than 90% of the then-outstanding amount of one or more series of Notes, in which case the consent
of the holders of at least 90% of the then-outstanding Notes or relevant series of Notes, as applicable, shall
be required.

Subject to certain limitations, holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the thenoutstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust of power. The Trustee may withhold
from holders of the Notes notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default if it determines that
withholding notice is in their interest, except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of
principal, interest or Additional Amounts or premium, if any.

No holder of any of the Notes has any right to institute any proceedings with respect to the
Indenture or any remedy thereunder, unless the holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of
the outstanding Notes have made written request, and offered satisfactory indemnity and/or security
(including by way of pre-funding), to the Trustee to institute such proceeding as the Trustee under the
Notes and the Indenture, the Trustee has failed to institute such proceeding within 60 days after receipt of
such notice and offer of satisfactory indemnity and/or security (including by way of pre-funding) and the
Trustee, during such 60-day period, has not received directions inconsistent with such written request
from the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes. Such limitations do
not, however, apply to a suit instituted by a holder of a Note for the enforcement of the payment of the
principal of, premium, if any, and any Additional Amounts or interest on such Note on or after the respective
due dates expressed in such Note.

The Company will promptly, and in any event within 15 Business Days of becoming aware of such
Default or Event of Default, notify the Trustee of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default that
is continuing. Except in the case of a Default or an Event of Default in payment of principal of, premium, if
any, Additional Amounts or interest on any Notes, the Trustee may withhold the notice to the holders of


-----

such Notes if a committee of its trust officers in good faith determines that withholding the notice is in the
interests of the holders of the Notes. If a Default or an Event of Default occurs and is continuing and
the Trustee is informed in writing, the Trustee will mail to each holder of the Notes notice of the Default or
Event of Default within five Business Days after being notified of its occurrence. The Company will
deliver to the Trustee, on or before a date not more than 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, a written
statement as to compliance with the Indenture, including whether or not any Default has occurred. The
Trustee is under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by the Indenture at the
request or direction of any of the holders of the Notes unless such holders offer to the Trustee indemnity
and/or security (including by way of pre-funding) satisfactory to the Trustee against the costs, expenses and
liabilities which might be incurred thereby.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trustee may not (and the holders of the Notes shall not
request that the Trustee) exercise any rights or remedies provided under the Notes Documents with respect
to any Event of Default if (a) the event giving rise to such Event of Default was disclosed to the Trustee in a
notice delivered pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph and (b) two years have passed since the
date of such notice; provided that such limitation shall not apply if the Trustee has commenced any remedial
action in respect of such Event of Default prior to the end of such two-year period.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Indenture, with respect to any Default or Event of
Default, the words “exists”, “is continuing” or similar expressions with respect thereto shall mean that such
Default or Event of Default has occurred and has not yet been cured or waived. For the avoidance of
doubt, if any Default or Event of Default occurs due to (a) the failure by the Issuer to take any action by a
specified time (pursuant to the second immediately preceding paragraph), such Default or Event of
Default shall be deemed to have been cured at the time, if any, the Issuer takes such action or (b) the taking
of any action by the Issuer that is not then permitted by the terms of the Indenture or any other Notes
Document, such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to be cured on the earlier to occur of (x) the
date on which such action would be permitted at such time to be taken under the Indenture and the other
Notes Documents and (y) the date on which such action is unwound or otherwise modified to the extent
necessary for such revised action to be permitted at such time by the Indenture and the other Notes
Documents. For the avoidance of doubt, if any Default or Event of Default occurs that is subsequently
cured (a “Cured Default”), any other Default or Event of Default resulting from the taking of any action
by the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer, in each case which subsequent Default or Event of Default
would not have arisen had the Cured Default not occurred, shall be deemed to be cured automatically upon,
and simultaneous with, the cure of the Cured Default. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
paragraph, an Event of Default (the “Initial Default”) may not be cured pursuant to this paragraph:

(a) if the taking of any action by the Issuer, any Guarantor or Restricted Subsidiary that is
not permitted during, and as a result of, the continuance of such Initial Default directly
results in the cure of such Initial Default and the Issuer, any Guarantor or Restricted
Subsidiary had actual knowledge at the time of taking any such action that the Initial
Default had occurred and was continuing;

(b) in the case of an Event of Default clause (e) or (f) of the first paragraph under this
caption “—Events of Default” that directly results in material impairment of the rights
and remedies of the holders of the Notes and the Trustee under the Notes Documents and
such material impairment is incapable of being cured; or

(c) (A) in the case of an Event of Default under clause (c)(1) of the first paragraph under this
caption “—Events of Default” arising due to a failure to deliver a notice of default in
accordance with the second immediately preceding paragraph or (B) in the case of an Initial
Default for which the Issuer failed to give notice of such Initial Default in accordance
with the second immediately preceding paragraph and, in each case, an Authorized Officer
of the Issuer had actual knowledge of such failure to give such notice and reasonably
should have known in the course of his or her duties that the failure to provide such notice
would constitute an Event of Default.

**Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance of Indenture**

The Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have all of its obligations terminated with
respect to the outstanding Notes of a series and all obligations of the Guarantors discharged with respect
to the Guarantees of such series of Notes (“Legal Defeasance”) and cure all then-existing Events of Default
with respect to such series of Notes, except for, among other things, certain obligations, including those


-----

relating to the defeasance trust, obligations to transfer or exchange Notes of such series, to pay Additional
Amounts with respect to such series of Notes, to replace mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes of such
series and to maintain a paying agent for such series of Notes, and obligations with respect to the rights,
powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee.

In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have its obligations and the
obligations of the Guarantors released with respect to certain covenants that are described in the Indenture
and the Guarantees (“Covenant Defeasance”) and thereafter any omission to comply with such obligations
shall not constitute a Default or Event of Default with respect to the Notes of a series. In the event Covenant
Defeasance occurs, certain events (not including non-payment, and, solely with respect to the Issuer,
bankruptcy and insolvency events) described under “—Events of Default” will no longer constitute an
Event of Default with respect to the Notes of such series.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:

(a) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust with the Trustee (or such entity designated or
appointed (as agent) by the Trustee for this purpose), for the benefit of the holders of the
Notes of the applicable series, cash in Euro, European Government Obligations, or a
combination thereof (in the case of the Euro Notes) or Dollars or U.S. Government
Obligations, or a combination thereof (in the case of the Dollar Notes), in such aggregate
amounts as will be sufficient to pay the principal of, interest and premium, if any, on the
Notes of such series to maturity;

(b) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee:

(1) an opinion of United States counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee
confirming that (A) the Issuer has received from, or there has been published by,
the U.S. Internal Revenue Service a ruling or (B) since the Issue Date, there has been
a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either case to the effect
that, and based thereon such opinion of counsel will confirm that, the holders of
the outstanding Notes of the applicable series will not recognize income, gain
or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance
and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same
manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal
Defeasance had not occurred; and

(2) an opinion of counsel in the jurisdiction of incorporation of the Issuer and
reasonably acceptable to the Trustee to the effect that the holders of the Notes of
the applicable series will not recognize income, gain or loss for tax purposes of such
jurisdiction as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to tax in
such jurisdiction on the same amounts and in the same manner and at the same
times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred; and

(c) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee:

(1) an opinion of United States counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee
confirming that the holders of the outstanding Notes of the applicable series will
not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a
result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax
on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have
been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred; and

(2) an opinion of counsel in the jurisdiction of incorporation of the Issuer and
reasonably acceptable to the Trustee to the effect that the holders of the Notes of
the applicable series will not recognize income, gain or loss for tax purposes of such
jurisdiction as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to tax in
such jurisdiction on the same amounts and in the same manner and at the same
times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect (except as to transfer or
exchange of the Notes as expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all the outstanding Notes of a series
issued under the Indenture when:


-----

(a) either:

(1) all such Notes of the applicable series theretofore authenticated and delivered
(except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes which have been replaced or paid or Notes
whose payment has been deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by
the Issuer and thereafter repaid to the Issuer or discharged from such trust as
provided for in the Indenture) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation,
or

(2) all Notes of the applicable series not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for
cancellation (A) have become due and payable, (B) will become due and payable
at their stated maturity within one year, or (C) are to be called for redemption
within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of
notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the
Issuer; and the Issuer or any Guarantor has irrevocably deposited or caused to be
deposited with the Trustee (or such entity designated or appointed (as agent) by
the Trustee for this purpose) as trust funds in trust an amount in Euro, European
Government Obligations or a combination thereof (in the case of the Euro
Notes or any other Euro-denominated series) or Dollars, U.S. Government
Obligations or a combination thereof (in the case of the Dollar Notes or any other
Dollar- denominated series) sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness
on the Notes of the applicable series not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for
cancellation, including the principal of, premium, if any, any Additional Amounts
and accrued interest on, such Notes at such Maturity, stated maturity or
redemption date;

(b) the Issuer or any Guarantor has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under
the Indenture with respect to the Notes of the applicable series by the Issuer and any
Guarantor; and

(c) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an opinion of independent
counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, each stating that:

(1) all conditions precedent under the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and
discharge of the Indenture with respect to the Notes of the applicable series have
been complied with; and

(2) such satisfaction and discharge will not result in a breach or violation of, or
constitute a default under, the Indenture or any other material agreement or
instrument to which the Issuer, any Guarantor or any Subsidiary is a party or by
which the Issuer, any Guarantor or any Subsidiary is bound;

_provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including_
as to compliance with this clause (c) and the foregoing clauses (a) and (b)). The Trustee will be
entitled to rely conclusively on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion of counsel without independent
verification.

If requested by the Issuer, the Trustee may distribute any amounts deposited in trust to the holders
prior to maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be. In such case, the payment to each holder will
equal the amount such holder would have been entitled to receive at the stated maturity or on the relevant
redemption date, as the case may be. For the avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to holders
prior to the maturity or redemption date as set forth above will not include any negative interest, present value
adjustment, break cost or any other premium on such amounts.

**Modifications and Amendments**

Without limiting the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ ability to effect modifications or amendments
that are expressly permitted under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” or “—Certain
_Covenants—Intercreditor Deed; Additional Intercreditor Agreements” or are otherwise permitted under this_
caption “—Modifications and Amendments”, modifications and amendments of the Indenture, the Notes, any
Guarantee, the Intercreditor Deed, any additional intercreditor agreement and/or the Security Documents
may be made by the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee and the Security Trustee, in each case, to the extent a
party thereto, with the consent of the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the


-----

Notes then outstanding (unless a modification or amendment will only affect one series of the Notes, in
which case only the consent of the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes
then outstanding of such series shall be required); provided, however, that no such modification or
amendment may, without the consent of the holders of at least 90% of the then-outstanding aggregate
principal amount of the Notes (or, if a modification or amendment will only affect one series of the Notes,
the consent of the holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding
of such series):

(a) change the stated maturity of the principal of, or any installment of any Additional
Amounts or interest on any Note, or change to an earlier date the time at which any Note
may be redeemed, or waive a default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, any
Additional Amounts or interest on, any such Note or reduce the principal amount
thereof or the rate of interest thereon or any premium payable upon the redemption
thereof, or change the coin or currency in which the principal of any such Note or any
premium or any Additional Amounts or the interest thereon is payable, or impair the right
to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment after the stated maturity
thereof (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the redemption date);

(b) reduce the percentage in principal amount of such outstanding Notes, the consent of
whose holders is required for any such supplemental indenture, or the consent of whose
holders is required for any amendment, waiver of or compliance with provisions of the
Indenture;

(c) modify any of the provisions relating to any supplemental indentures requiring the
consent of holders or relating to the waiver of past defaults or relating to the waiver of
certain covenants, except to increase the percentage of such outstanding Notes required for
such actions or to provide that certain other provisions of the Indenture cannot be
modified or waived without the consent of the holder of each such Note affected thereby;

(d) except as otherwise permitted under “—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets” or the
definition of the term “Parent”, “Parent Intermediate Holdco” or “Company” or as part of
a Permitted Reorganization, assign or transfer any of the rights and obligations under
the Indenture of the Issuer or any Guarantor;

(e) release all or substantially all of the Collateral from the Liens created in favor of the
Trustee or the Security Trustee pursuant to the Security Documents or all or substantially
all of the Guarantors from the Guarantees created pursuant to the Indenture or any
supplemental indenture thereto, except as otherwise permitted by the terms of the Indenture,
the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Deed or any additional intercreditor
agreement;

(f) except as permitted by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Deed (or any additional
intercreditor agreement), make any change to any provision of the Indenture or the
Intercreditor Deed affecting the ranking or priority of any Note or Guarantee that would
adversely affect the rights of the holders of the Notes in any material respect;

(g) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture described under “—Payment of
_Additional Amounts” that adversely affects the holder’s or beneficial owner’s entitlement to_
(x) any exemption, in whole or in part, from withholding Taxes or (y) Additional
Amounts, in each case as described thereunder, unless the Issuer agrees to pay Additional
Amounts (if any) in respect thereof; or

(h) except as permitted by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Deed (or any additional
intercreditor agreement), release the Guarantee of the Parent or the Company.

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, the Indenture will provide that certain Guarantees or
Liens on the Collateral may be released in connection with sales or other dispositions of property or assets
(including Capital Stock) that do not violate the requirements of the covenants described under the caption
“—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments” or “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sale
_of Assets”, as each such covenant may be amended from time to time._

For the avoidance of doubt, it shall not be necessary for the consent of the holders of the Notes to
approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, waiver or other modification but it shall be
sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.


-----

For the purposes of determining whether holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of
any series of Notes not denominated in Euro have taken any action under the Indenture, the aggregate
principal amount of such series of Notes will be deemed to be the Euro Equivalent as of the date such series
of Notes is first issued of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of such series of Notes.

In addition to any modifications and amendments that are permitted under, or governed by, the
covenants set forth under the captions “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest”, “—Certain
_Covenants—Intercreditor Deed; Additional Intercreditor Agreements”, or the other provisions of this_
caption “—Modifications and Amendments” and not in limitation thereof, without the consent of any
holders of the Notes, the Issuer, the Trustee and the Security Trustee, in each case to the extent a party
thereto (without the need for any consent of or authorization or execution by any other party to the
Indenture) may modify or amend the Indenture, the Notes, any Guarantee, the Intercreditor Deed, any
additional intercreditor agreement or any Security Document:

(a) to evidence the succession of another Person to the Issuer or any Guarantor or any other
obligor under the Notes and the assumption by any such successor of the covenants of the
Issuer or such Guarantor in the Indenture (including any supplemental indenture), the
Notes, any Guarantee, the Intercreditor Deed, any additional intercreditor agreement or
any Security Document, as applicable, in accordance with “—Consolidation, Merger and
_Sale of Assets”;_

(b) to add to the covenants of the Issuer, any Guarantor or any other obligor upon the Notes
for the benefit of the holders of the Notes or to surrender any right or power conferred
upon the Issuer or any Guarantor or any other obligor upon the Notes, as applicable, in the
Indenture (including any supplemental indenture), the Notes, any Guarantee, the
Intercreditor Deed, any additional intercreditor agreement or any Security Document;

(c) to cure any ambiguity, or to correct or supplement any provision in the Indenture
(including any supplemental indenture), the Notes, any Guarantee, the Intercreditor Deed,
any additional intercreditor agreement or any Security Document which may be defective
or, for the avoidance of doubt, erroneous, or inconsistent with any other provision in the
Indenture (including any supplemental indenture), the Notes, any Guarantee, the
Intercreditor Deed, any additional intercreditor agreement or any Security Document or
any disclosure in the Offering Memorandum or to make any other provisions with respect
to matters or questions arising under the Indenture (including any supplemental
indenture), the Notes, any Guarantee, the Intercreditor Deed, any additional intercreditor
agreement or any Security Document that shall not adversely affect the legal rights of
the holders of the Notes in any material respect or that shall improve or increase the rights
of the holders of the Notes;

(d) to add a Guarantor under the Indenture and to provide for or confirm the existence of
any limitations in any Guarantee authorized under the Indenture;

(e) to evidence and provide the acceptance of the appointment of a successor Trustee under
the Indenture;

(f) to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in favor of the Security
Trustee for the benefit of the holders of the Notes as additional security for the payment
and performance of the Issuer’s or any Guarantor’s obligations under the Indenture, in any
property, or assets, including any of which are required to be mortgaged, pledged or
hypothecated, or in which a security interest is required to be granted to the Security Trustee
pursuant to the Indenture or otherwise (any such additional security shall be deemed to
be Collateral for all purposes under the Indenture);

(g) to provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with the Indenture;

(h) to conform the text of the Indenture or the Notes to any passage in this “Description of
_the Notes” to the extent that such passage was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a_
provision of the Indenture or the Notes;

(i) to make, complete or confirm any grant of Collateral permitted or required by the
Indenture;


-----

(j) to evidence or provide for the release of any Guarantee or any Lien on any Collateral that
is otherwise permitted by the terms of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the
Intercreditor Deed or any additional intercreditor agreement; or

(k) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes
(provided that the uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of
Section 163(f) of the Code).

In connection with its execution of any amendment pursuant to the preceding paragraph, the
Trustee shall be entitled to request and rely on such evidence as to whether such amendment is authorized
by such paragraph as the Trustee may request, which may include an Officer’s Certificate and/or an opinion
of counsel.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the paragraph above, in order to effect an amendment
authorized by clause (d) above to add a Guarantor under the Indenture, it shall only be necessary for the
supplemental indenture providing for the accession of such additional Guarantor to be duly authorized and
executed by (i) the Issuer, (ii) such additional Guarantor and (iii) the Trustee. Except as otherwise set forth
herein, any amendments permitted by the Indenture need only be duly authorized and executed by the Issuer
and the Trustee.

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding may waive
compliance with the restrictive covenants and provisions of the Indenture.

For the avoidance of doubt, no modification or amendment to, or deletion of, or actions taken in
compliance with, any of the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants”, shall be deemed to impair
or affect any rights of the holders of the Notes to receive payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or
interest on, the Notes.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees will be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the laws of the State of New York. The Intercreditor Deed will be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, English law. The Security Documents will be governed by applicable local law of the
jurisdiction under which Liens are granted.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer and each Guarantor will appoint INEOS USA LLC,
with its registered office at Corporation Trust Center, 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, DE 19801, United
States or any successor, as its authorized agent upon whom process may be served in any suit, action or
proceeding arising out of or based upon the Indenture, the Notes or the Guarantees or the transaction
contemplated in the Indenture which may be instituted in any New York State or Federal court in the
Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York and will submit to such jurisdiction.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since many of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors are outside the United States, any
judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or any Guarantor, including judgments with
respect to the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional Amounts, redemption price and any
purchase price with respect to the Notes, may not be collectable within the United States.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator, member or shareholder of the Issuer, any Guarantor,
any of their respective parent companies or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates as such, shall
have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture (including the Guarantees), the Notes
or the Security Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or
their creation. Each holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release
are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities
under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on
the Notes will be prescribed 10 years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims against the


-----

Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed five years after the
applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Concerning the Trustee**

The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the Issuer and its Affiliates and
Subsidiaries.

The holders of a majority in principal amount of the then-outstanding Notes will have the right to
direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the
Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture will provide that in case an Event of Default occurs
(which has not been cured), the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of
care of a prudent man in the conduct of his own affairs. Subject to such provisions, the Trustee will be under
no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any holder of
Notes unless such holder shall have offered to the Trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to it against
any loss, liability or expense.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE COLLATERAL AND THE GUARANTEES**

The Notes and the guarantees will be secured by security interests in the assets described below
(the “Collateral”). The security interests in the Collateral will (subject to Permitted Collateral Liens) be firstranking security interests, except for certain security interests granted to secure the Notes which, as a
matter of local law, will be granted as junior-ranking security interests in relation to the security granted in
respect of the Senior Secured Term Loans and the Existing Senior Secured Notes. The Intercreditor Deed
provides that as a contractual matter among Senior Creditors (as defined in the Intercreditor Deed), the
Notes will be secured on a pari passu basis with the Existing Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Term
Loans, certain hedging obligations and certain cash management obligations and will be treated as such
for purposes of the application of proceeds from the enforcement of such Collateral. The existing firstranking liens securing the Senior Secured Term Loans and the Existing Senior Secured Notes that were
created under Luxembourg, New York and Norwegian law will remain in place and will extend to secure the
Notes. In some jurisdictions, the security documents creating the existing first-ranking liens securing the
Senior Secured Term Loans and the Existing Senior Secured Notes will be amended to extend such liens (or,
with respect to Belgian security, to confirm that these liens extend) to the Notes (or, with respect to French
and certain of the German security interests, junior ranking security interests will be granted). The existing
first-ranking liens securing the Senior Secured Term Loans and the Existing Senior Secured Notes that
were created under English law, Scottish law, Jersey law and Singapore law will remain in place, and new
liens over the same Collateral will be created in these jurisdictions to secure the Notes. In these jurisdictions
where new liens are created, the ranking of these new liens relative to the existing liens will, as a matter of
general law, depend on a number of factors, such as the nature of the liens, the order of creation of the liens,
compliance with the jurisdiction’s perfection requirements with respect to the liens and the order of giving
notices with respect to the liens, and accordingly without the Intercreditor Deed, the new liens would be likely
to rank after the existing liens. However, the Intercreditor Deed provides that, as a contractual matter, the
liens securing the Notes, the Existing Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Term Loans will rank
_pari passu and will be treated as having equal priority with respect to the application of proceeds from_
the enforcement of any Collateral. See the specific local law security interests described below under
“—Summary of the Guarantees and Collateral for the Notes” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the
Notes and Our Capital Structure—Prior ranking security interests—Any other creditors with prior ranking
liens will have prior access to proceeds of certain Collateral and your rights to enforce your security over
the Collateral are limited,” “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees and the Security
Interests” and “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Deed.” Upon the completion of the
implementation of the security interests in the Collateral, the Notes and the guarantees will, subject to the
terms and conditions of the Indenture and to the extent possible, be secured by security interests in all of the
assets and property that secure the obligations under the Existing Senior Secured Notes, the Senior
Secured Term Loans, certain hedging liabilities and certain cash management liabilities. As of the date of
completion of the granting of the guarantees, the Notes will be guaranteed by all of those entities that
guarantee the obligations under the Existing Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Term Loans.

The following is a country-by-country summary of the guarantees and the Collateral in respect of
the Notes that will be in place following the completion of the grants of the guarantees and the Collateral.
This summary is not complete and does not describe any of the limitations of, existing encumbrances on, and
defects in respect of the guarantees and Collateral, or any of the specific assets, properties and rights that
will be excluded from the guarantees and the Collateral. The granting of the guarantees and the security
interests in the Collateral is subject to compliance with the agreed security principles (the “Security Principles”)
to be set forth in an exhibit to the Indenture, which embody the recognition that there may be certain legal
and practical difficulties in obtaining guarantees and security interests in every jurisdiction in which the
Guarantors are incorporated and hold assets.

In addition, prior to the execution by the parties thereto of the security documents in respect of
the Notes, the composition of the Collateral may change (including due to the application of the Security
Principles), and any such change or changes could be material.

As described herein, the security in respect of the Notes will be implemented in two or more stages.
Not all the Collateral that will secure the Notes will be implemented as of the Issue Date. In addition, there
may be delays in the implementation of the guarantees and the Collateral.

-----

**LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE**
**SECURITY INTERESTS**

Set out below is a summary of certain limitations on the enforceability of the guarantees and the
security interests in each of the jurisdictions in which guarantees or Collateral are being provided.

It is a summary only, and proceedings of bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event could be initiated
in any of these jurisdictions and in the jurisdiction of organization of a future Guarantor of the Notes. The
application of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction’s
law should apply, and could adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights and to collect payment in full
under the Notes, the guarantees and the security interests on the Collateral.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of certain limitations on the validity and
enforceability of the guarantees and security interests for the Notes and certain aspects of insolvency law in
Belgium, Canada, England and Wales, Germany, Jersey, Luxembourg, Norway, Singapore, Switzerland
and the United States, which are the jurisdictions in which the Issuer, the Guarantors and the providers of
security to the Notes are organized or incorporated. In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, the
Guarantors, the providers of security to the Notes or any other of IGH or IHL’s subsidiaries experienced
financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions bankruptcy,
insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable
insolvency or corporate arrangement laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations of the Issuer, the
Guarantors and/or any security granted thereby. The descriptions below do not purport to contemplate or
discuss all of the limitations or considerations that may affect the Notes, the Guarantees or any security
interests granted in connection therewith. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Capital
_Structure—Relevant insolvency laws in England, Luxembourg and other jurisdictions may provide you with less_
_protection than U.S. bankruptcy law”._

**European Union**

Several of the Guarantors or providers of security for the Notes are organized or incorporated
under the laws of Member States of the European Union.

Regulation (EU) no. 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on
insolvency proceedings (the “Recast EU Insolvency Regulation”) entered into force on June 26, 2017 and is
applicable to insolvency proceedings opened on or after that date, replacing Council Regulation
(EC) no. 1346/2000 on insolvency proceedings (which continues to apply to insolvency proceedings opened
prior to June 26, 2017). Pursuant to the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, which applies within the
European Union (other than Denmark), the court which shall have jurisdiction to open main insolvency
proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the Member State where the company has its “centre of
main interests” (“COMI”) (which, according to Article 3(1) of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, is
“the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is
ascertainable by third parties”). The determination of where any such company has its COMI is a question
of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views.

The term “centre of main interests” is not a static concept and may change from time to time.
Although there is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation that
a company has its COMI in the Member State in which it has its registered office, this presumption only
applies if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within the 3-month period prior
to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings.

Further, Preamble 30 of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation states that “it should be possible to
rebut this presumption where the company’s central administration is located in a Member State other than
that of its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes,
in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual centre of management and
supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other Member State.” In that respect,
factors such as where board meetings are held, the location where the company conducts the majority of its
business and the location where the large majority of the company’s creditors are established may all be
relevant in the determination of the place where the company has its COMI. The point at which a company’s
COMI is determined is at the time that the relevant insolvency proceedings are opened.

If the COMI of a company is and will remain located in the Member State (other than Denmark)
in which it has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under the
Recast EU Insolvency Regulation may only be commenced in such jurisdiction, and accordingly a court in


-----

such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex
A to the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation. Main insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State under
the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other Member States (other than
Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be opened in another Member State. If the COMI of a
company is in one Member State (other than Denmark) under Article 3(2) of the Recast EU Insolvency
Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open “territorial
proceedings” only in the event that such company has an “establishment” in the territory of such other
Member State. “Establishment” is defined in Article 2(10) of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation to mean
any place of operations where the company carries out or has carried out in the 3-month period prior to
the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and
assets. The effects of those territorial proceedings are restricted to the assets of the company situated in
the territory of such other Member State where proceedings were opened. If a company does not have an
establishment in any other Member State, no court of any other Member State has jurisdiction to open
territorial proceedings in respect of such company under the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation.

Where main insolvency proceedings in the Member State in which a company has its COMI have
not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can be opened in another Member State where the
company has an establishment, provided that either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the
Member State in which that company’s COMI is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the
territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of either (i) a creditor whose claim arises from
or is in connection with the operation of the establishment situated within the territory of the Member State
where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested or (ii) a public authority which, under the law of
the Member State within whose territory the establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening of
insolvency proceedings.

The Recast EU Insolvency Regulation provides for a cooperation and communication mechanism
in the event that insolvency proceedings concerning two or more members of a group of companies are
opened. Insolvency practitioners appointed in proceedings concerning a member of the group shall cooperate
with any insolvency practitioner appointed in proceedings concerning another member of the group to the
extent that such cooperation is appropriate. Similarly, the court which has opened proceedings shall also
cooperate with any other court before which a request is made to open proceedings concerning another
member of the group to the extent that cooperation is appropriate to facilitate the effective administration
of the proceedings, is not incompatible with the rules applicable to them and does not entail any conflict of
interest. In this respect, the courts may, where appropriate, appoint a third party, provided that this is not
incompatible with the rules applicable to them.

Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings,
such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the local
insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor.
Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the Member State
of the European Union within the territory of which insolvency proceedings have been opened in
accordance with its Article 3 shall have jurisdiction for any action that derives directly from the insolvency
proceedings and is closely linked with them, such as avoidance actions.

The courts of all Member States of the European Union (other than Denmark) must recognize the
judgment of the court opening the main proceedings and give the same effect to the judgment so long as no
secondary proceedings have been opened there. The insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in a
Member State (other than Denmark) which has jurisdiction to open main proceedings (because the
company’s COMI is there) may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of that Member State in
another Member State (other than Denmark), such as to remove assets of the company from that other
Member State, subject to certain limitations, so long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in that
other Member State nor any preservation measure has been taken to the contrary further to a request to
open insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the company has assets.

**Belgium**

**_Insolvency Proceedings_**

Pursuant to European and Belgian law rules on conflict of laws, if any Guarantor has its center of
main interests in Belgium (a “Belgian Guarantor”), main insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Belgium.
A company is generally presumed to have its center of main interests at the location of its corporate seat,
but this presumption is rebuttable. Such proceedings would then be governed by Belgian law, subject to


-----

certain exceptions. Under certain circumstances, the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation and Belgian law also
allows secondary bankruptcy proceedings to be opened in Belgium over the assets situated in Belgium of
companies whose center of main interests are not situated in Belgium. The effects of those secondary
bankruptcy proceedings are restricted to the assets situated in Belgium. The following is a brief description
of certain aspects of Belgian insolvency law to the extent relevant in the context of the present transaction.

Belgian insolvency law provides for three main insolvency proceedings: judicial reorganization
proceedings (gerechtelijke reorganisatie/réorganisation judiciaire), transfer under the court’s supervision
(overdracht onder gerechtelijk gezag/transfert sous autorité judiciaire) and bankruptcy proceedings
(faillissement/faillite). These three proceedings are regulated by Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic
Law (Wetboek van economisch recht/Code de droit économique), as amended. Note that Belgian (insolvency)
law offers different out of court restructuring options and allows for liquidation in deficit (deficitaire
_vereffening/liquidation déficitaire). These proceedings will not be further discussed._

Recently an Act was adopted in the Belgian Parliament to implement the EU Restructuring
Directive 2019/1023 (the “New Insolvency Act”). The New Insolvency Act amends certain provisions of
Book XX of the Code of Economic Law. These new provisions apply to insolvency proceedings (including
judicial restructuring) opened as of September 1, 2023. Note that the New Insolvency Act (i) distinguishes
between private and public reorganization proceedings, (ii) no longer considers the transfer under the
court’s supervision to be a judicial reorganization and (iii) offers the possibility for companies to silently
prepare for bankruptcy proceedings (the “Pre-packaged Bankruptcy Proceeding”). These key changes are
briefly discussed below.

**_Judicial Reorganization Proceedings and Transfer under Court’s Supervision_**

Judicial reorganization proceedings and transfer under court’s supervision are available to all legal
entities as well as all individuals that qualify as an enterprise (onderneming/entreprise) in the sense of
Article I.1, 1° of the Belgian Code of Economic Law, subject to certain exceptions for regulated liberal
professions, credit institutions and certain other entities active on the financial and insurance markets.

A judicial reorganization and transfer under court’s supervision may be initiated at the request of
the debtor if the continuity of the enterprise is at risk, whether immediately or in the future. The content of
this principle is broad and is defined in practice by the courts. The fact that the conditions for bankruptcy
are met (entailing that the debtor has the legal obligation to declare bankruptcy under Book XX of the
Belgian Code of Economic Law) does not preclude the debtor from filing for judicial reorganization or
transfer under court’s supervision.

In addition, in the event of manifest shortcomings (kennelijk tekortkomingen/manquements
_caractérisés) on the part of the debtor jeopardizing the continuity of the debtor or in the event the debtor_
company becomes unmanageable, the debtor, any creditor, the public prosecutor or any other interested party
may request the court to appoint a restructuring expert (herstructureringsdeskundige/praticien de la
_réorganisation) who can be tasked with opening judicial reorganization proceedings. The debtor may also_
request the court to appoint a restructuring expert to facilitate its recovery.

In certain circumstances, creditors, third parties interested in acquiring the business or the public
prosecutor may summon the debtor and seek the transfer of all or part of the debtor’s business under
court’s supervision.

The obligation to declare bankruptcy is suspended as from the filing of a petition for judicial
reorganization or transfer under court’s supervision. As from the filing of the petition and as long as the
court overseeing the judicial reorganization or the transfer under court’s supervision has not issued a ruling
on the petition, the debtor cannot be declared bankrupt (save in case the debtor files a declaration of
bankruptcy itself) or be wound up by court order. In addition, during the period between the filing of the
petition and the court’s decision, as a rule, none of the creditors may proceed with the enforcement of any
security interests that such creditors may hold with respect to the debtor’s assets. There are, however, important
exceptions to this rule, including, among other things, that beneficiaries of security over bank accountsv
and shares are not subject to the stay on enforcement. Note that the filing of the petition does not have an
automatic suspensory effect if the debtor requested the opening of a judicial reorganization less than
12 months before.

Within a period of 15 days as from the filing of the petition, the court will examine such petition,
and within eight days following such examination the court will decide on the opening of the judicial
reorganization procedures or a transfer under court’s supervision, allowing a temporary moratorium for a


-----

maximum period of four months. Subject to certain conditions, the moratorium period can thereafter be
extended up to a total maximum period of 12 months if justified in light of the circumstances. In the context
of a transfer under court’s supervision, a further extension of four months is possible.

The granting of the temporary moratorium operates as a stay on enforcement. No enforcement
measures with respect to pre-existing claims (i.e., for debts incurred before the judgment opening the
judicial reorganization proceedings or transfer under court’s supervision) in the moratorium can be continued
or initiated against any of the debtor’s movable and immovable assets from the time that the moratorium
is granted until the end of the period, with few exceptions. During the moratorium, the debtor can also not
be declared bankrupt (except upon declaration of the debtor itself) and, if the debtor is a legal entity,
judicial dissolution will not be possible during this period.

If receivables are pledged by the debtor in favour of a creditor prior to the opening of the judicial
reorganization proceedings or transfer under court’s supervision, these will not be affected by the moratorium
provided that the receivables are pledged specifically to that creditor from the moment when the pledge is
created. The holder of such pledged receivables is permitted to take enforcement measures against the estate
of the initial counterparty of the debtor (such as the debtor’s customers) during the moratorium.
Receivables that form part of a pledge over business assets do not benefit from such exemption. A pledge
on financial instruments and cash on account within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Act of
December 15, 2004, as amended from time to time, (the “Belgian Financial Collateral Act”), such as shares
in any Belgian Guarantor, can be enforced notwithstanding the enforcement prohibition imposed by the
moratorium. In the case of a pledge on cash held on accounts, the enforcement prohibition applies, save in
the event of payment default or if certain other conditions are met. Personal guarantees granted by third
parties in favour of the debtor’s creditors are not covered by the enforcement prohibition imposed by the
moratorium, nor are the debts payable by co-debtors, subject to certain exceptions or qualifications in respect
of guarantees granted by individuals. The moratorium also does not prevent the voluntary payment by the
debtor of claims covered by the moratorium, to the extent such payment is necessary for the continuity of the
enterprise.

During judicial reorganization proceedings or proceedings relating to transfer under court’s
supervision, as a general rule, the board of directors and management of the debtor continue to exercise
their management functions, albeit under the limited supervision of the court.

The initiation of judicial reorganization proceedings or proceedings for transfer under court’s
supervision does not terminate any contracts, and contractual provisions which provide for the early
termination or acceleration of the contract upon the initiation or approval of a reorganization procedure,
and certain contractual terms such as compensation clauses (including but not limited to default interest),
may not be enforceable. Such enforcement prohibition applies, with a few exceptions, to close-out netting
provisions as well if the judicial reorganization procedure affects (i) a corporate debtor which is not a
public or financial legal entity within the meaning of the Belgian Financial Collateral Act or (ii) a public or
financial legal entity where the creditor is not such an entity.

Moreover, Belgian Insolvency Law provides that a creditor may not terminate a contract on the
basis of a debtor’s default that occurred prior to the commencement of the reorganization procedure unless
the debtor would not remedy such default within a 15-day period following the notification of such
default.

As an exception to the general rule of continuity of contracts, the debtor may cease performing a
contract during the reorganization proceedings, provided that the debtor notifies the creditor and the
decision is necessary for the debtor to be able to propose a reorganization plan to its creditors or to transfer
all or part of the company or its assets. The exercise of this right does not prevent the co-contractor from
suspending the performance of its own obligations. The co-contractor can however not terminate the
agreement solely on the ground that the debtor has suspended the performance of its own obligations.

Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic Law provides for two types of reorganization: (i) an
amicable settlement between the debtor and some of its creditors or (ii) a collective agreement. Book XX of
the Belgian Code of Economic Law also provides for the possibility to transfer (part of) the activities of
the debtor under court’s supervision. Where initially such a transfer was a reorganization procedure, this is
no longer the case for transfers opened as of September 1, 2023.

**_Amicable Settlement_**

In the case of an amicable settlement, the debtor can draw up an agreement and joint payment
scheme plan with one or more creditors with a view to restructuring par or all of its assets and activities.


-----

Only the parties to such amicable settlement will be bound by the terms they have agreed to. Such in-court
agreement requires unanimity among the creditors concerned. The debtor may petition the court to grant a
grace period in respect of its payment obligations, including, for example, in relation to interest payments,
pending the negotiation of the agreement. Once agreement is reached, the court will in principle homologate
it. Such an amicable settlement will remain enforceable in the event of a later bankruptcy, subject to
certain exceptions.

**_Collective Agreement_**

In the case of a judicial reorganization by collective agreement (or reorganization plan), Belgian
Insolvency Law provides for two different regimes: a regime applicable to small and medium sized enterprises
(“SMEs”) and a regime for large companies and SMEs that have elected to opt-in to the regime for large
companies. The regime applicable to SMEs will not be discussed.

With regards to large companies (i.e., companies which, during two consecutive financial years,
meet one or more of the following thresholds: (i) annual average number of employees of 250, (ii) annual
turnover excluding VAT of EUR 40,000,000, or (iii) the balance sheet total reaches EUR 20,000,000—this
also applies if group companies together exceed one or more of the thresholds), the parties affected by the
plan (which could be creditors and equity holders) agree to a reorganization plan through a voting
process. Under the large enterprise regime, creditors can and to a certain extend must be placed in different
voting classes if their rights in a bankruptcy liquidation or the rights obtained under the proposed
restructuring plan are so dissimilar that there is no comparable position. Secured creditors and unsecured
creditors must be divided in different classes. A creditor can only be considered secured (both for purposes of
voting and treatment under the plan) to the extent of the liquidation value of the collateral. In principle, a
restructuring plan is adopted if each class has voted in favor of the restructuring plan, i.e., if a simple majority
(in amount of the claim) is obtained in each class. The plan may include measures such as the reduction or
rescheduling of liabilities and interest obligations, amendment to contracts and the swap of debt into equity
and may be based on a differentiated treatment of various categories of affected parties. Belgian Insolvency
Law contains certain limitations, primarily aimed at protecting employees of the debtor. If the plan is
approved, the reorganization plan needs to be confirmed by the court prior to it taking effect. At the occasion
of the confirmation, the court will perform a number of tests, including whether the plan complies with
the formal requirements under the law and, in case of dissenting classes of affected parties, whether the
criteria for cross-class cram-down are satisfied.

A reorganization plan is deemed approved if each class of affected parties approves the plan.
A class of affected parties is deemed to approve the plan if it is approved by creditors or equity holders
representing a fifty percent majority in value of the claims or (in case of equity holders) the participations.
Moreover, a reorganization plan can also be approved if one or more classes dissent if the restructuring plan
respects certain conditions (“cross-class cram-down”), including the application of the absolute priority
rule. Once approved, the plan will bind all the classes of affected parties.

**_Private Judicial Reorganization_**

The New Insolvency Act distinguishes between private and public judicial reorganization. As of
1 September 2023, Book XX of the Code of Economic Law allows debtors to apply for a private judicial
reorganization by amicable or collective agreement. In such case, all proceedings will be confidential except
for the debtor or the practitioner, the court and the specific creditors involved.

Private judicial restructuring proceeding may be initiated by a debtor or a creditor of the company.
The opening of the proceedings would only impact those parties that will be affected by the plan, which
may be limited to financial creditors for example. The restructuring expert will determine the creditors to be
involved in the plan. The court rules within eight days on the petition for private judicial reorganization.
Opting for the private judicial reorganization implies a court-appointed restructuring expert who assists all
parties during the negotiations. During a private judicial reorganization, the debtor does not automatically
benefit from a stay of enforcement measures, but under certain conditions the restructuring expert may
request the court to apply a stay in respect of certain creditors.

**_Transfer under Court’s Supervision_**

The court authorized transfer of all or part of the debtor’s enterprise can be requested by the
debtor in its petition or at a later stage in the procedure. It may also be requested by the public prosecutor,
by a creditor or by any party who has an interest in acquiring, in whole or in part, the debtor’s enterprise, and
the court can order such transfer in specific circumstances. The price of the transferred assets should at


-----

least be equal to the liquidation value. In case of comparable offers, priority will be given to the offer
guaranteeing employment by way of a social agreement.

The court-ordered transfer will be organized under the supervision of a liquidation expert.
Following the transfer, the recourse of the creditors will in most cases be limited to the transfer price,
subject to certain exceptions.

In the case of a court-ordered transfer, co-contractors of on-going agreements can be forced to
continue to perform the agreement without their consent after the transfer (except in case of intuitu
personae agreements), provided historical debts under such agreement are paid.

Since September 1, 2023, the transfer must be followed by liquidation or bankruptcy proceedings
of the debtor.

**_Pre-packaged Bankruptcy Proceedings_**

These (pre-pack) proceedings allow insolvent companies to discreetly prepare for the transfer of
assets and activities under court supervision before formal bankruptcy proceedings are opened. Pre-packaged
bankruptcy proceedings can only be initiated by the debtor. In its petition, the debtor must demonstrate
that these proceedings will (i) facilitate the liquidation of the company while achieving the highest possible
distribution to the creditors as a whole, and (ii) preserve jobs to the extent possible.

If the court grants the debtor’s request, a liquidation expert is appointed for maximum 30 days
(with possible extension to a total of 60 days). The liquidation expert takes the lead during the preparation
phase and assesses whether the transfer of all or part of the undertaking is likely to be successful, considering
the interests of all creditors involved.

The preparation phase is done under the supervision of a prospective supervisory judge. During
the preparations, the debtor remains in control of its assets and the day-to-day operation of its business
and the debtor will not benefit from a moratorium. However, the debtor actively cooperates to achieve the
transfer of its assets within the shortest possible time. Following the confidential preparation procedure,
formal bankruptcy proceedings are opened.

**_Bankruptcy_**

Bankruptcy proceedings may be initiated by the debtor, by unpaid creditors, upon the initiative of
the public prosecutor’s office, by the provisional administrator of the debtor’s assets (if there are strong
indications that the conditions for bankruptcy are met), by the liquidator of the debtor’s assets or by the
liquidator of “main insolvency proceedings” opened in another EU Member State (other than Denmark) in
accordance with the EU Insolvency Regulation. Once the court ascertains that the requirements for
bankruptcy are met, the court fixes the date prior to which the debtor’s creditors must submit all claims of
unpaid debts, as well as the date of the first report on the verification of claims. The court can be requested to
pronounce the judicial dissolution (gerechtelijke ontbinding/dissolution judiciaire) of the debtor, provided
that (i) the conditions for bankruptcy are met, (ii) there are no significant assets available, and (iii) the public
interest requires a judicial dissolution rather than a bankruptcy.

Bankruptcy proceedings may be opened in respect of any “enterprise” as defined by Article I.1, 1°
of the Code of Economic Law (which includes notably any legal person, other than certain public law
entities). Conditions for a bankruptcy order (faillietverklaring/déclaration de faillite) are that the debtor
must be in a situation of sustained cessation of payments (op duurzame wijze opgehouden hebben te betalen/
_cessation de paiements de manière persistante) and must be unable to refinance its debts (wiens krediet_
_geschokt is/ébranlement de crédit). Cessation of payments is generally accepted to mean that the debtor is_
not able to pay its debts as they have fallen due. Such a situation must be persistent and not merely temporary.
The mere fact that a debtor has more debts than assets does not necessarily mean that the bankruptcy
conditions are met. Companies in liquidation can be declared bankrupt up to six months after the judgments
of the closing of the liquidation.

In bankruptcy, the debtor loses all authority and decision rights concerning the management of
the bankrupt business. The bankruptcy receiver (curator/curateur), appointed by the court, becomes
responsible for the operation of the business and implements the sale of the debtor’s assets, the distribution
of the sale proceeds to creditors and the liquidation of the debtor. The rights of creditors in the process
are limited to being informed of the course of the bankruptcy proceedings on a regular basis by the
bankruptcy receiver. Creditors may oppose the sale of assets by bringing an action before the court or may
request the temporary continued operation of the business.


-----

The bankruptcy receiver must decide whether to continue performance of ongoing contracts
(i.e., contracts existing before the bankruptcy order). The bankruptcy receiver may elect to continue the
business of the debtor, provided the bankruptcy receiver obtains the authorization of the court and such
continuation does not cause any prejudice to the creditors. However, two exceptions apply:

(a) the parties to an agreement may contractually agree that the occurrence of a bankruptcy
constitutes an automatic early termination or acceleration event; and

(b) _intuitu personae contracts (i.e., contracts whereby the identity of the counterparty_
constitutes an essential element upon the signing of the contract) are automatically
terminated as of the bankruptcy judgment, since the debtor is no longer responsible for
the management of the company. Parties can however agree to continue to perform under
such contracts.

The bankruptcy receiver may elect not to perform the obligations of the bankrupt party which are
still to be performed after the bankruptcy under any agreement validly entered into by the bankrupt party
prior to the bankruptcy if such decision is necessary for the management and the liquidation of the bankrupt
estate. The counterparty to an ongoing contract may summon the bankruptcy receiver to take a decision
within 15 days. If no extension of the 15 days term is agreed upon or if the bankruptcy receiver does not take
any decision, the ongoing contract is presumed to be terminated after the expiration of the 15 days term.
The counterparty to that agreement may make a claim for damages in the bankruptcy and such claim will
rank pari passu with claims of all other unsecured creditors and/or seek a court order to have the relevant
contract dissolved. The counterparty may not seek injunctive relief or require specific performance of the
contract.

As a general rule, the enforcement rights of individual creditors are suspended upon the rendering
of the court order opening bankruptcy proceedings, and after such order is made, only the bankruptcy
receiver may proceed against the debtor and liquidate its assets. However, such suspension does not apply
to a pledge on financial instruments or cash held on account falling within the scope of the Belgian Financial
Collateral Act. Further exceptions exist with regard to estate credits (boedelschulden/dettes de la masse).

For creditors with claims secured by movable assets (other than financial collateral), such suspension
would normally be limited to the period required for the verification of the claims. At the request of the
bankruptcy receiver, the suspension period may be extended for up to one year as from the bankruptcy
judgment. Such extension requires a specific order of the court which can only be made if the further
suspension will allow for a realization of the assets in the interest of all creditors without prejudicing the
secured creditors and provided that those secured creditors have been given the opportunity to be heard
by the court. However, a pledge on financial instruments or cash held on accounts can be enforced during
the suspension period.

For creditors with claims secured by immovable assets, the intervention of the bankruptcy receiver
is necessary to pursue the sale of the assets, subject to certain exceptions. The bankruptcy receiver will do
so upon an order of the court, given either at its request or at the request of a mortgagee. A first-ranking
mortgagee will generally be entitled to pursue the enforcement of its mortgage as soon as the report of claims
has been finalized. The court may suspend such enforcement for a period of not more than one year from
the date of the bankruptcy if the suspension will allow for a realization of the assets without prejudicing the
mortgagee provided that the mortgagee has been given the opportunity to be heard by the court.

If a security interest, such as a pledge, has been granted over assets that, at the time of opening of
an insolvency proceeding, are located in another EU Member State, the rights the creditor has under such
security shall, in accordance with the EU Insolvency Regulation, not be affected by the opening of such
insolvency proceedings.

As from the date of the bankruptcy judgment, no further interest accrues against the bankrupt
debtor on its unsecured debt, or debts secured by a general privilege, such as tax debts or social security
debts.

The debts of the bankrupt estate generally will be ranked as to priority on the basis of complex
rules. The following is a general overview of only the main principles:

(a) Estate debt: Costs and indebtedness incurred by the bankruptcy receiver during the
bankruptcy proceedings, the so-called “estate debts,” have a senior priority. In addition, if
the bankruptcy receiver has contributed to the realization and enforcement of secured assets,


-----

such costs will be paid to the bankruptcy receiver in priority out of the proceeds of the
realized assets before distributing the remainder to the secured creditors. Tax and social
security claims incurred during the judicial reorganization proceedings will be preferential
debts of the estate in a subsequent liquidation or bankruptcy;

(b) Security interests: Creditors that hold a security interest have a priority right over the
secured asset (whether by means of appropriation of the asset or on the proceeds upon
realization);

(c) Privileges: Creditors may have a particular privilege on certain or all assets (including, for
example tax claims, claims for social security premiums, etc.). Privileges on specific assets
rank before privileges on all assets of the debtor. Certain privileges prevail over the
security interests;

(d) Unsecured creditors (pari passu): Once all estate debts and creditors having the benefit of
security interests and privileges have been satisfied, the proceeds of the remaining assets will
be distributed by the bankruptcy receiver among the unsecured creditors who rank pari
_passu (unless a creditor agreed to be subordinated); and_

(e) Subordinated creditors will receive the remainder (if any).

Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic Law provides that any assets, amounts and sums of
distributions (such as income generated by a new activity) received after a bankruptcy are excluded from
the bankruptcy estate if their relevant cause dates from after the bankruptcy.

**_Subsidiary Guarantee_**

The grant of a guarantee or collateral by a Belgian Guarantor for the obligations of another group
company must fall within the grantor’s corporate object and corporate purpose and be for the own corporate
benefit of the granting Belgian Guarantor. Corporate benefit is not a well-defined concept under Belgian
law and its interpretation is left to the courts and legal authors. The corporate benefit rules and their
application in the context of granting guarantees or collateral for the benefit of a group company are not
clearly established under Belgian law and there is only limited case law on this issue.

If the granting of a guarantee or the creation of a security interest does not fall within the
grantor’s corporate object or purpose, then such guarantee or security interest could, upon certain conditions,
be held null and void. The assessment of whether or not the grant of a guarantee or security interest is in
the relevant Belgian Guarantor’s own corporate benefit is largely dependent on factual considerations and is
to be determined on a case-by-case basis by the board of directors of such Belgian Guarantors at the time
of the granting of the guarantees or security interests, in anticipation of their enforcement and to be reviewed
ultimately on a case-by-case basis at the time of the enforcement by the competent courts. Consideration
has to be given to any direct and/or indirect benefit that such Belgian Guarantor would derive from the
transaction. This is particularly relevant for upstream or cross-stream guarantees and security interests. It is
generally considered by legal scholars that at least the following principles apply to such evaluation: (i) the
risk taken by the Belgian Guarantor in issuing the guarantee must be proportional to the direct and/or
indirect benefit derived from the transaction; and (ii) the financial support granted by the Belgian
Guarantor should not exceed its financial capabilities. The responsibility for such assessment lies with the
board of directors of the Belgian Guarantors. The corporate benefit justification by the company’s
management will be subject to only a “marginal review” by the courts. In insolvency situations, however,
the courts can be expected to take a more critical view.

If the corporate benefit requirement is not met, the (board of) directors of the Belgian Guarantor
may be held liable (i) by the company for negligence in the management of the company and (ii) by third
parties in tort and under criminal law in certain specific circumstances (i.e., where the specific facts can be
qualified as “abuse of company goods” (misbruik van vennootschapsgoederen/abus de biens sociaux)).
Moreover, the guarantee or security interest could be declared null and void and, under certain circumstances,
the creditor that benefits from the guarantee or security interest may also be held liable on the basis of the
principles of tort liability. Alternatively, the guarantee or collateral could be reduced to an amount
corresponding to the corporate benefit and, under certain circumstances, the creditor could be held liable
on the basis of the principles of tort liability for any guarantee amount in excess of such amount. These rules
have however seldom been tested under Belgian law, and there is only limited case law on this issue.

In order to enable Belgian subsidiaries to grant a guarantee and security interest to secure liabilities
of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Belgian rules on corporate


-----

benefit, it is standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents
to contain so-called “limitation language”in relation to subsidiaries incorporated or established in Belgium.
Accordingly, the purchase agreements in respect of the Notes, the Indenture and the security documents will
contain such limitation language and the security and the guarantees of the Belgian Guarantors will be so
limited.

The Indenture will expressly provide, substantially to the effect that, the obligations of each
Belgian Guarantor under the guarantee clause of the Indenture:

(a) shall not include any liability which would constitute unlawful financial assistance (as
determined in article 5:152 or 7:227 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations
Code, as applicable, or any other applicable provision of the Belgian Code of Companies
and Associations Code depending on the type of undertaking the Belgian Guarantor is);
and

(b) shall be limited to a maximum aggregate amount equal to the greater of (a) 90% of such
Belgian Guarantor’s net assets (as defined in article 5:142 or 7:212 of the Belgian Code of
Companies and Associations Code, as applicable, or any other applicable provision of
the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations Code depending on the type of
undertaking the Belgian Guarantor is) as shown in its most recent audited annual financial
statements as approved at its meeting of shareholders, and (b) the aggregate of the
amounts, either directly or through one or more other companies of the INEOS Group,
made available to such Belgian Guarantor and its subsidiaries (if any) using all or part of the
proceeds of the Notes (increased by all interests, commissions, costs, fees, expenses and
other sums accruing or payable in connection with such amount).

**_Financial assistance_**

Any guarantee granted by a Belgian Guarantor which constitutes a breach of the provisions on
financial assistance as defined by Article 5:152 or 7:227 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations,
as applicable, or any other applicable provision of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations
depending on the type of undertaking the Belgian Guarantor is, might not be enforceable.

**_Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer_**

In the event of bankruptcy proceedings governed by Belgian law, certain transactions may be
declared ineffective against third parties if concluded or performed by the debtor during the so-called
“hardening period” (verdachte periode/période suspecte).

In principle, the cessation of payments (which constitutes a condition for filing for bankruptcy) is
deemed to have occurred as of the date of the bankruptcy order. The court issuing the bankruptcy order
may determine, based on serious and objective indications, that the cessation of payments occurred on an
earlier date. Such earlier date may not be earlier than six months before the date of the bankruptcy order,
except in the case where the bankruptcy order relates to a company that was dissolved more than
six months before the date of the bankruptcy order in circumstances suggesting an intent to defraud its
creditors, in which case the date of cessation of payments may be determined as being the date of such
decision to dissolve the company. The period from the date of cessation of payments up to the declaration
of bankruptcy is referred to as the “hardening period”.

The transactions entered into or performed during the hardening period which may be declared
ineffective against third parties and are unenforceable against the bankruptcy receiver include, among
others, (i) gratuitous transactions or transactions entered into at an undervalue or on extremely beneficial
terms for the counterparty, (ii) payments for debts which have not yet fallen due (iii) payments other than in
cash for debts due and (iv) new security interests provided for pre-existing debts.

Other transactions entered into or performed during the hardening period may be declared
ineffective against third parties provided that the counterparty was aware of the debtor’s cessation of
payment. In particular, a guarantee or security interests entered into during the hardening period may be
declared ineffective against third parties if (i) it is regarded as having been granted gratuitously, unbalanced
or at an undervalue, (ii) the beneficiaries of the guarantee or security interests were aware of the debtor’s
cessation of payments or (iii) it is granted to secure pre-existing debts.

If the guarantee or security interests granted by the Belgian Guarantor were successfully voided
(based on the above), holders of the Notes would cease to have any claim in respect thereof and could be


-----

under an obligation to repay any amounts received pursuant to such guarantee or the enforcement proceeds
of the security interests.

Furthermore, even in the absence of bankruptcy proceedings, a third party creditor may obtain a
court ruling that an act or transaction (such as a guarantee) is not enforceable against it if it can establish
that the challenged act or transaction was effected with the fraudulent intent to adversely affect its position
as an existing creditor (actio pauliana).

Regardless of fraudulent intent, registration of a security interest after cessation of payments can
also be declared ineffective against third parties, when more than 15 days have passed in between the date of
the deed and the date of registration.

**_Recognition and Enforcement_**

The granting of a guarantee and of security interests may be subject to validity and/or enforceability
conditions. The breach of any of such conditions may render such guarantee or security interest invalid or
unenforceable. The foreclosure of a guarantee or of security interests may be subject to formalities (including,
for example, judicial or non-judicial consent) and may be time consuming in the event that the foreclosure
takes place under judicial control or in the event of a legal dispute. Courts may condition the enforcement of
a guarantee or a security interest upon the evidence that the creditor has a final and undisputed claim
triggering the foreclosure of the guarantee or security interest. Enforcement of guarantees or security
interests may be hindered by conflict of law and/or conflict of jurisdiction issues and may not breach any
public policy provision and/or mandatory legal provisions. Courts may require a sworn translation in French
or Dutch of the English documents which they may review.

In particular, and without limiting the generality of what is set out above, validity, effectiveness and
enforceability of certain security interests may be limited as follows:

     - bank account and receivables pledge: the perfection of the pledge towards respectively the
account bank or the debtor of the pledged receivables requires a notice of pledge or
acknowledgment of pledge by the relevant account bank or debtor. In the absence of notice (or,
in the case of a receivable governed by foreign law, of compliance with the applicable rules set by
that foreign law), the pledge is not perfected as against the debtors of the receivables and (i) the
debtors may still validly pay the receivables to the pledgor, (ii) the debtors may still raise defenses
of set-off, (iii) subsequent assignment or pledge of the receivables to a bona fide third party in
respect of which notice is given first would take priority over the pledge effected by the bank
account and receivable pledge agreement, (iv) the pledge will not be effective against a third-party
creditor of the company (such as, typically, a creditor, a creditor having made an attachment on
the receivables) to whom a debtor would, in good faith, have paid a receivable before having
received notice of the pledge, and (v) it is uncertain whether, after notice, debtors may still raise
defenses of set-off.

     - pledge on moveable assets: the perfection of the pledge towards third parties requires a registration
of the pledge with the National Pledge Register (Nationaal Pandregister/Registre National des
_gages) established by a royal decree of 14 September 2017 in execution of the articles of title XVII_
of book III of the Belgian Civil Code relating to the use of the National Pledge Register. The
pledgee or its proxy holder is responsible to complete the registration process through an online
application by inserting, amongst others, the identity of the parties, the secured amount, the
pledged asset and a declaration of the pledgee confirming he assumes liability for any incorrect
information. The pledge will become effective as of the date of payment of the retribution and
such registration remains valid for a renewable period of 10 years. As long as it is not recorded
with the National Pledge Register, there is a risk that the holders of Notes secured by such pledge
on moveable assets will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interest in
that collateral; and

     - pledge on registered shares representing the issued share capital of a Belgian company: a notice
of pledge must be recorded and dated in the share register of the Belgian company to be enforceable
against third parties. As long as the recordation is not effectuated in the share register of the
Belgian company, there is a risk that the holders of Notes secured by such pledge on registered
shares will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interest in that collateral.

**_Mandates and third-party rights_**

The registration duties and other fees payable in connection with the vesting of mortgages in
respect of real property located in Belgium—which are calculated on the basis of the maximum secured


-----

amount under the relevant mortgage—are material. In order to avoid such costs, the maximum secured
amount under a mortgage is often limited. Additional amounts will be secured by way of mortgage mandates.
Pursuant to such mandates, an irrevocable power of attorney is granted to a third party for the purposes
of creating one or more mortgages over the relevant property to the benefit of the Security Trustee.

The creation of mortgages pursuant to these mandates will not have any retroactive effect,
i.e., the security interest will be created as of the date of conversion of the mortgage mandate into a
mortgage and will take rank at that date. In addition, if a mortgage mandate is converted into a mortgage
during the “hardening period” (verdachte periode/période suspecte) as security interest for a pre-existing debt,
such security interest will not be enforceable against the bankrupt estate (niet tegenwerpelijk aan de boedel/
_inopposable à la masse)._

In addition, various rights may have been granted or may exist in favor of third parties on some
parcels of immovable goods on which mortgages will be granted. These rights could either limit the rights
of the Security Trustee under the mortgage or impose an obligation that the prior consent of the relevant
third party is obtained before the mortgage is granted.

**_Parallel Debt_**

It is generally assumed that under Belgian law certain security rights, such as a mortgage, cannot
be validly created in favor of a person who is not the creditor of the claim that the security interest intends
to secure. The beneficial holders of the Notes from time to time will not be party to the Security Documents.
In order to permit the holders of the Notes from time to time to have a secured claim, the Intercreditor
Agreement will provide for the creation of a “parallel debt.”Pursuant to the parallel debt, the Security Trustee
becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Notes. Certain
security interests created under the Security Documents will directly secure the parallel debt. The parallel
debt concept has not been tested under Belgian law, and there is no certainty that it will eliminate or mitigate
the risk of unenforceability posed by Belgian law.

**Canada**

INEOS Canada Investment Company and INEOS Canada Company are unlimited companies
organized under the laws of the Province of Nova Scotia, Canada and INEOS Canada Partnership is a
general partnership organized under the laws of the Province of Alberta, Canada (collectively, the “Canadian
**Guarantors” and individually, a “Canadian Guarantor”). Bankruptcy and insolvency matters are within**
the jurisdiction of the Federal government of Canada, but provincial laws can affect bankruptcy and
insolvency proceedings including with respect to establishing priority of payments. In the event of the
insolvency of any Canadian Guarantor, insolvency proceedings with respect to that Canadian Guarantor
may be initiated in Canada. Canadian insolvency laws and applicable provincial legislation would govern
those proceedings (subject to laws or protocols that may be applicable to international insolvencies if
proceedings also occur in other jurisdictions in respect of those Guarantors, and those foreign proceedings
are recognized by a Canadian Court). The insolvency laws of Canada and related provincial legislation may
restrict, delay or limit certain of your rights and remedies, including in respect of priority of claims, the
ability to obtain post-filing interest and other amounts and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and
hence may limit your ability to recover payments due on the Notes or to require the performance by the
Canadian Guarantors of their obligations, their guarantees or the Security Documents to which they are
party.

In the event of the insolvency of INEOS European Holdings Limited, such insolvency proceedings
could impact the ability to recover under the Canadian Security. Canadian insolvency laws and applicable
provincial legislation would govern those proceedings (subject to laws or protocols that may be applicable to
international insolvencies if proceedings also occur in other jurisdictions, and those foreign proceedings
are recognized by a Canadian court). The insolvency laws of Canada and related provincial legislation may
restrict, delay or limit certain of your rights and remedies, including in respect of priority of claims, the
ability to obtain post-filing interest and other amounts and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and
hence may limit your ability to recover payments due on the Notes or the Security Documents to which
INEOS European Holding Limited is a party.

In Canada, there are two primary Federal statutes that govern insolvency and restructuring
proceedings of corporate debtors. The Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (the “BIA”) contains provisions for
the liquidation of insolvent companies (in a manner loosely akin, in substance, to U.S. Chapter 7
proceedings, although there are important distinctions) and for the restructuring of corporations (in a


-----

manner loosely akin, in substance, to U.S. Chapter 11 proceedings, although there are important
distinctions). Similar to bankruptcy proceedings in the United States, a corporate debtor may be petitioned
into bankruptcy (i.e., involuntary proceedings) or file for bankruptcy or reorganization (i.e., voluntary
proceedings). In addition to the BIA, Canada also has the Companies’Creditors Arrangement Act (“CCAA”),
which is a restructuring statute that operates, in practice, in a manner loosely akin to U.S. Chapter 11
proceedings (with important distinctions). CCAA proceedings are only available to insolvent debtor
companies having debts in excess of CDN$5 million (or such other amount prescribed by regulation under
the CCAA). Insolvency proceedings in Canada, whether under the BIA or the CCAA, are courtsupervised.

Upon the bankruptcy of a debtor corporation, whether voluntarily or upon the application of a
creditor, the BIA imposes an automatic stay of any action, execution or other proceeding by unsecured
creditors in respect of the debtor, unless the creditors obtain leave of the applicable court to continue or
commence the proceeding. In a liquidation (as opposed to restructuring) context, the stay of proceedings
does not generally apply to secured creditors, who are free to exercise their rights of self-help or to otherwise
realize on their security outside of the BIA. However, if requested by formal motion, the court may, in
exceptional cases, stay the rights of a secured creditor for up to six months. Upon becoming bankrupt,
whether voluntarily or involuntarily, all of a debtor’s assets (subject to very limited exceptions) vest in the
trustee in bankruptcy (subject to the rights of secured creditors with validly perfected security interests), at
which point the debtor no longer has any ability to deal with those assets. The trustee typically proceeds to
liquidate the assets and distribute the proceeds of the assets in accordance with the provisions of the BIA.

The BIA sets out the priority scheme for the payment of claims against a bankrupt debtor, which
priority scheme takes precedence over any operative priority scheme outside of bankruptcy. Subject to
certain statutory priority claims enumerated in the BIA (including, without limitation, “super priority”
charge under the BIA against a debtor’s current assets for certain employee wages as well as charges to secure
certain unremitted source deductions and certain arrears in pension plan contributions) and true trust
claims, secured creditors have the right to look first to the assets charged by their validly perfected security
for payment. Thereafter, the BIA provides a list of preferred creditors who recover their debts in priority to
the general body of unsecured creditors. Preferred claims are paid to the extent of their statutory priority,
in order of their ranking, before any payments to lower-ranking preferred creditors or general unsecured
creditors. All other claims will be considered general unsecured claims and rank pari passu.

If there is any surplus after payment to the unsecured creditors, the balance will be used to pay
interest from the date of the bankruptcy at 5% per annum on all unsecured claims proved in the bankruptcy
according to their priority. Any remaining amount would then be available for shareholders. It is exceedingly
rare for there to be surplus proceeds in bankruptcy proceedings.

The proceeds resulting from the realization of the estate of an insolvent Canadian Guarantor may
not be sufficient to satisfy secured claims or your deficiency claims as unsecured creditors under the
guarantees granted by each Canadian Guarantor after the applicable Canadian Guarantor’s prior ranking
secured creditors and other claims that rank in priority to claims of holders of Notes have been satisfied.
Further, the proceeds resulting from the realization of the Canadian Security may not be sufficient to
satisfy secured claims.

Corporate restructurings in Canada may be implemented under either the BIA or the CCAA, with
the latter being more commonly used by larger corporations. Partnerships are not eligible to apply for relief
under the CCAA, however it is customary for one or more of the partners to file under the CCAA, and
then obtain an order that extends all of the relevant rights and protections afforded by the CCAA to the
partnership itself. Such an order is at the discretion of the Court, but routinely made where the operations
of the partnership are closely connected to the operations of the partner(s). Because INEOS Canada
Partnership is a partnership, it would therefore not be eligible for CCAA proceedings unless (a) one or
more of the INEOS Canada Partnership partners obtained CCAA relief, and (b) the Court extended the
CCAA relief to the partnership by way of an order. In the case of either a BIA or CCAA restructuring, a
broad stay of creditors’ rights and enforcement proceedings is generally implemented (in the case of the BIA
by a statutory stay, and in the case of the CCAA by a court-ordered stay). A CCAA stay generally applies
to secured creditors, subject to certain limited exceptions. Under this court-ordered protection, the debtor
may formulate a restructuring proposal or plan or conduct an orderly wind-down or a sale as a going
concern. In the event of a restructuring proposal or plan, a double majority of the creditors (i.e., a simple
majority in number, having two-thirds in value of the claims in question) present and voting either in person
or by proxy at a meeting of creditors for each designated class or claims must approve the proposal or
plan, and the proposal or plan must then be sanctioned by the court. Secured creditors may be included in


-----

such a proposal or plan and thereby have their secured claims compromised, reduced or deducted (in which
case they may have a right to vote in a separate class) or may be dealt with outside of the proposal or
plan. As an alternative to a plan, or in addition, a debtor may effect the sale of all or a portion of its assets
in CCAA proceedings. Such sales may be structured as a conventional assets sale, in which assets are
transferred to the purchaser free and clear of liabilities and liens, or as a share sale, where the purchaser
acquires the shares of the debtor company and all or a portion of the debtor’s liabilities are vested out of
the debtor by court order. In the event of a sale, proceeds are generally distributed to creditors in accordance
with the priority established by statute and the court (which may differ in some respects from those in a
bankruptcy under the BIA). The court may also authorize the creation of priority charges ranking ahead of
other creditors in both CCAA and BIA restructurings (for example, for interim or debtor-in-possession
financings, directors’ and officers’ indemnification and administration costs). A sale under BIA restructuring
or CCAA out of the ordinary course requires approval by the court with notice to the secured creditors
likely to be affected by the proposed sale. The court may approve such sales absent a vote by the creditors in
certain circumstances.

The manner in which secured and unsecured creditors would be treated in a restructuring proposal
or plan would generally be proposed by a debtor in terms of such plan, subject to (i) the rights of creditors
affected by the proposal or plan to vote on such proposal or plan and (ii) approval by the court.

Where a debtor deals with its property in a manner that prejudices its creditors (particularly where
such debtor is or becomes thereafter insolvent), such transactions by the debtor may be subject to challenge
by creditors, bankruptcy trustees or other interested parties, and the scrutiny of the court as fraudulent
preference, transfer-at-undervalue or other reviewable transaction. Under Canadian federal and provincial
law, there are a number of statutory means to challenge or void such transactions. Where a transaction subject
to review is held to be contrary to Canadian law (including because it preferred one creditor over others or
resulted in a loss of value to the debtor estate), the transaction is subject to being voided and a wide variety of
possible remedies may be imposed. Should the Canadian Guarantors become insolvent within applicable
time periods, the granting of the guarantees, and the grant of security in connection therewith, could be
subject to challenge and the guarantees and security potentially avoided, and any amounts obtained under the
guarantee or security in support thereof that is avoided would have to be repaid. Should the holders of the
Notes be repaid or otherwise recover from the Canadian Guarantors at a time when such Guarantors are
insolvent, or if the Canadian Guarantors thereafter become insolvent within applicable time periods, the
repayment or recovery may be subject to challenge.

Secured creditors may also enforce their security by, among other things, applying to the court for
the appointment of a receiver or a receiver/manager. The conduct of the receivership will be governed by
provincial law and the relevant provisions of the BIA and will be under the supervision of the court.

In the event of a foreign insolvency proceeding, both the CCAA and the BIA allow a representative,
authorized in respect of a debtor, to seek recognition of the foreign insolvency proceeding in Canada. The
CCAA and the BIA each provide for a slightly modified version of the UNCITRAL Model Law on
Cross-Border Insolvency (collectively, the “Recognition Provisions”). The Recognition Provisions allow an
authorized representative to apply for recognition of the foreign insolvency proceeding as either a “foreign
main proceeding” or a “foreign non-main proceeding.” The determination of the type of proceeding is
based upon the “center of main interest” (the “COMI”) of the debtor. The COMI test is essentially the same
as set forth in the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency and chapter 15 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code, with some variations. If the court determines that the foreign proceeding is a “foreign
main proceeding,” the court must grant a stay of proceedings in Canada and may grant additional relief
permitted under the CCAA or the BIA. If the court determines that the foreign proceeding is a “foreign
non-main proceeding,” the court may, but is not required to, grant a stay of proceedings in Canada and
any other relief permitted under the CCAA or the BIA. In the event of a recognition order being granted
in respect of a foreign main proceeding or, subject to the discretion of the court of a foreign non-main
proceeding, certain restrictions are imposed on the debtor company, including a restriction on selling assets in
Canada unless the court approves such asset sale transaction. In the event that the foreign proceeding
results in the approval of a restructuring plan, the Canadian court may grant such plan full force and
recognition in Canada.

**England and Wales**

The Issuer, the Parent and the Company (both Guarantors) are companies incorporated under the
laws of England and Wales (together with a number of other Guarantors incorporated under the laws of


-----

England and Wales, the “English Obligors”). Therefore, any main insolvency proceedings in respect of the
English Obligors would likely be commenced in England.

**_The United Kingdom’s Withdrawal from the European Union_**

Unless insolvency proceedings or certain related proceedings were opened prior to the expiry of
the transition period, which commenced on January 31, 2020 and expired on December 31, 2020 (the
“Transition Period”), in which case the unmodified Recast EU Insolvency Regulation and related EU
insolvency legislation govern the proceedings, insolvency proceedings with respect to English Obligors would
likely proceed under, and be governed by, English insolvency laws in force at the time of commencement
of the relevant proceedings. However, to the extent that an English Obligor has its COMI in an EU Member
State, insolvency proceedings could, pursuant to the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation and subject to
certain exceptions, be opened in the relevant Member State and be subject to the laws of that Member State
(see “—European Union”). In addition, pursuant to the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/
1030) (the “Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations”), certain foreign courts may have jurisdiction to oversee
insolvency proceedings of any English Obligor which has its COMI or an “establishment” (being a place
of operations where it carries out a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets or
services) in such foreign jurisdiction.

Although the scope of the English courts’ jurisdiction varies for the different insolvency proceedings
available in England and Wales, English courts generally have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings
in respect of any company which has its COMI in the United Kingdom or which has its COMI in an EU
Member State (other than Denmark) and an “establishment” in the United Kingdom. An “establishment” is
defined in the same way as under the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation (see “—European Union”). While
this allows English courts to assume jurisdiction over certain foreign companies in respect of certain
insolvency proceedings, the efficacy of such proceedings will significantly depend on the likelihood and
extent of subsequent recognition of such proceedings in relevant other jurisdictions.

The Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations, which implemented the UNCITRAL Model Law on
Cross-Border Insolvency in the United Kingdom, allow a foreign representative to apply to the English
courts for recognition of certain foreign law insolvency proceedings. If recognition is granted, those foreign
law proceedings may benefit from certain protections, some of which may arise automatically (depending
on the circumstances) and some of which are at the discretion of the English courts. The recognition of
English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of schemes of arrangement, which are restructuring rather
than insolvency proceedings, will be subject to treaties regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of
courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention on Choice
of Court Agreements 2005 (the “Hague Convention”) and the Lugano Convention 2007 (the “Lugano
**Convention”) (subject to the United Kingdom’s pending application to accede to the latter, which was blocked**
by the European Commission in 2021) where these apply. In addition, recognition may still be available
under principles of private international law and Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament
and of the Council of June 17, 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (“Rome I”).

The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of restructuring plans is a
developing area of law. It remains to be seen whether restructuring plans will fall within the scope of
treaties regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of
civil judgments such as the Hague Convention, or whether they will be treated more akin to insolvency and
restructuring proceedings and fall within related exceptions to such treaties, although an initial judgment
from 2021 suggests that the latter approach may be followed.

English insolvency law may not be as favorable to the interests of investors as the laws of the
United States or other jurisdictions with which investors are familiar. In the event that any English Obligor
experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or
similar proceedings.

The Issuer’s obligations under the Notes will be guaranteed by the English Obligors and secured by
security interests over the Collateral. English insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the
enforceability of a guarantee against an English Obligor and the enforceability of security interests over the
Collateral.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to certain
limitations on the guarantees or the security interests over the Collateral.


-----

The application of these laws could adversely affect investors, their ability to enforce their rights
under the guarantees and/or the Collateral securing the Notes and therefore may limit any amounts that
investors may receive in an insolvency of an English Obligor.

**_Fixed and Floating Charges_**

There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has an advantage over floating charge
security, including: (a) an administrator appointed to a charging company can convert floating charge
assets to cash and use such cash, or use cash subject to a floating charge, to meet administration expenses
(which can include the costs of continuing to operate the charging company’s business) while in administration
in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder; (b) a fixed charge, even if created after the date of a
floating charge, may have priority as against the floating charge over the charged assets (provided that the
floating charge has not crystallised at the time the fixed charge was granted); (c) general costs and expenses
(including the remuneration of the insolvency officeholder) properly incurred in a winding-up are payable out
of the company’s assets (including the assets that are the subject of the floating charge) in priority to
floating charge claims; (d) until the floating charge security crystallizes, a company is entitled to deal with
assets that are subject to floating charge security in the ordinary course of business, meaning that such assets
can be effectively disposed of by the charging company so as to give a third party good title to the assets
free of the floating charge and meaning that there is a risk of security being granted over such assets in
priority to the floating charge security; (e) floating charge security is subject to certain challenges under
English insolvency law (please see “—Challenges to Guarantees and Security—Grant of Floating Charge”);
(f) where the floating charge is not a security financial collateral arrangement (please see “—Administration
and Floating Charges”), floating charge security is subject to the claims of preferential creditors (such as
occupational pension scheme contributions and salaries owed to employees) and to ring-fencing for unsecured
creditors (please see “—Priority on insolvency”); and (g) an administrator may dispose of or take action
relating to property subject to a floating charge without the prior consent of the charge holder or court,
although the floating charge holder retains the same priority in respect of the proceeds from the disposal of
the assets subject to the floating charge. With prior approval of the court, an administrator may deal with
property subject to a fixed charge provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the
administration’s purpose and that the administrator apply the net proceeds from the disposal of the property
in question towards discharging the obligations of the company to the charge holder.

Under English law, there is a possibility that a court could re-characterize fixed security interests
purported to be created by a security document as floating charges and the description given to security
interests by the parties is not determinative. Whether security interests labeled as fixed will be upheld as fixed
security interests rather than floating security interests will depend, among other things, on whether the
chargee has the requisite degree of control over the relevant chargor’s ability to deal in the relevant assets
and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the chargee in practice. Where the
chargor is free to deal with the secured assets without the consent of the chargee prior to crystallization, the
court is likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding
that it may be described as a fixed charge in the security documents.

**_Administration and Floating Charges_**

The relevant English insolvency statutes empower English courts to make an administration order
in respect of an English company in certain circumstances. An administration order can be made if the
court is satisfied that the relevant company is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts” and that the
administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration. A company is unable to
pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow”basis (unable to pay its debts as they fall due) or if it is insolvent
on a “balance sheet” basis (the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities,
taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities). Such insolvency is presumed if, among other
matters, the company fails either to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 or to
satisfy in full or in part a judgment debt (or similar court order). An administrator can also be appointed
out of court by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge and different procedures
apply according to the identity of the appointor.

The purpose of an administration is comprised of three objectives that must be looked at
successively: rescuing a company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a
better result for a company’s creditors as a whole than would be likely upon immediate liquidation or, if
neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable, and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not
unnecessarily harmed thereby, realizing property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential
creditors. The order of priority which applies to any distribution to creditors is set out below (see “—Priority
on insolvency”).


-----

In general, during the administration, no proceedings or other legal process may be commenced or
continued against the debtor, or security enforced over the company’s property, except with leave of the
court or the consent of the administrator. Accordingly, if any of the English Obligors were to enter into
administration, the relevant guarantees and the Collateral could not be enforced while the relevant company
was in administration without the permission of the court or consent of the administrator. There can be
no assurance that the Security Trustee would obtain such permission of the court or consent of the
administrator.

Certain creditors of a company in administration may be able to realize their security over that
company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of
the moratorium in relation to a “security financial collateral arrangement” (generally, a charge over cash or
financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradable capital market debt instruments) under the
Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (the “Financial Collateral Regulations”). If an
English Obligor were to enter administration, it is possible that, to the extent that it is not a financial
collateral arrangement, the security granted by it or the guarantee granted by it may not be enforced while
it is in administration, without the leave of the court or consent of the administrator. In addition, other than
in limited circumstances, no administrative receiver can be appointed by a secured creditor in preference
to an administrator, and any already appointed must resign if requested to do so by the administrator. Where
the company is already in administration no other receiver may be appointed and an administrative
receiver may only be appointed with the leave of a court or consent of the administrator.

In addition, an administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business and, subject to certain
requirements under the Insolvency Act 1986 (as amended) (the “Insolvency Act 1986”), dispose of the
property of a company in administration (including property subject to a floating charge).

In order to empower the Security Trustee to appoint an administrative receiver or an administrator
out of court to the company, the floating charge granted by the relevant English Obligor must constitute a
“qualifying floating charge” for purposes of English insolvency law and, in the case of the ability to appoint
an administrative receiver, the qualifying floating charge must, unless the security document pre-dates
September 15, 2003, fall within one of the exceptions in the Insolvency Act 1986 to the prohibition on the
appointment of administrative receivers. In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating
charge must be created by an instrument which (a) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to
it, (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company or (c) purports to
empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by Section 29(2) of the
Insolvency Act 1986. The Security Trustee will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if such
floating charge security, together (if necessary) with the fixed charge security interests, relate to the whole
or substantially the whole of the relevant English Obligor’s property and at least one such security interest is
a qualifying floating charge. Whether the assets that are subject to the floating charges and other security
will constitute substantially the whole of the relevant English Obligor’s assets at the time that the floating
charges are enforced will be a question of fact at that time and there is no statutory guidance as to
what percentage of a company’s assets should be charged to satisfy this test. The most relevant exception to
the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception relating to “capital
market arrangements” (as defined in the Insolvency Act 1986), which will apply if the Issuer of the Notes
creates a debt of at least £50,000,000 for the relevant company during the life of the arrangement and the
arrangement involves the issue of a “capital markets investment” (which is defined in the Insolvency Act
1986, but is generally a rated, listed or traded debt instrument).

If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the
court (and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of
court procedure) and then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court
considers that the security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of
challenge on certain grounds. If an administrator is appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate
office. Further, upon the appointment of an administrator, any receiver of part of the company’s property
must resign if required to do so by the administrator unless that receiver was appointed under a charge
created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement” (as defined in the Financial
Collateral Regulations).

**_Liquidation_**

Liquidation is a termination procedure applicable to companies incorporated under the laws of
England and Wales. There are three ways an English company may be placed into liquidation or “wound


-----

up,” being (1) Members’ Voluntary Liquidation (which is a procedure available to solvent companies only),
(2) Creditors’ Voluntary Liquidation and (3) Compulsory Winding-Up.

On the voluntary liquidation of an English company, there is no automatic statutory moratorium
in place preventing the holders of security interests from taking steps to enforce those security interests
(although the liquidator or any creditor or shareholder of the company in liquidation may apply to court
for a stay). Where a company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales is placed into liquidation,
a creditor holding a valid mortgage, charge or other security interest has four options: (1) to realize the
security, apply the proceeds towards discharge of the secured debt, and prove in the liquidation for any
balance; (2) to retain the security and not prove in the liquidation; (3) to value the security and prove for any
shortfall between that value and the value of the debt; and (4) to surrender the security and prove for the
full amount of the debt.

The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary
liquidation. In a compulsory winding-up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act 1986, any disposition of
the relevant company’s property made after the commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned
by the court, void. Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a company
by the court, it is deemed to have commenced from the time of the presentation of the winding-up petition.
Once a winding-up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company will be
imposed. No legal action may be continued or commenced against the company without permission of the
court.

**_Foreign Currency_**

Under English insolvency law, where creditors are asked to submit formal proofs of claim for their
debts, the office-holder will convert all foreign currency denominated proofs of debt into sterling at a single
rate for each currency determined by the office-holder by reference to the exchange rates prevailing on the
relevant date. If a creditor considers the rate to be unreasonable, they may apply to the court. Accordingly, in
the event that an English Obligor goes into liquidation or administration, holders of the Notes may be
subject to exchange rate risk between the date that such English Obligor went into liquidation or
administration and receipt of any amounts to which such holders of the Notes may become entitled.

**_Priority on Insolvency_**

With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined below), distributions generally cannot be
made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior ranking class have been paid in full.
Unless creditors have agreed otherwise, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are
distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class.

The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority):

     - First ranking: holders of fixed charge security and creditors with a proprietary interest in
specific assets in the possession (but not full legal and beneficial ownership) of the debtor but
only to the extent of the realizations from those secured assets or with respect to the asset in which
they have a proprietary interest;

     - Second ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate (there are statutory provisions setting out the
order of priority in which expenses are paid);

     - Third ranking: these are divided into ordinary preferential creditors and secondary preferential
creditors with ordinary preferential creditors being paid in priority to secondary preferential
creditors. Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent
company in relation to: (a) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (b) wages
and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a
maximum of £800 per person; (c) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been
terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the date of insolvency; and
(d) bank and building deposits eligible for compensation under the Financial Services
Compensation Scheme up to the statutory limit. As between one another, ordinary preferential
debts rank equally. Secondary preferential debts include (x) the balance of insured bank and
building deposits above the statutory limit of amounts insured under the Financial Services
Compensation Scheme and (y) with respect to all insolvencies commencing on or after December 1,
2020, claims by HM Revenue and Customs in respect of certain taxes including VAT, PAYE
income tax, student loan deductions, employee National Insurance contributions and Construction


-----

Industry Scheme deductions which are held by the company on behalf of other taxpayers such
as employees and customers. As between another, secondary preferential debts rank equally;

     - Fourth ranking: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security, to
the extent of the realizations from those secured assets.

This would include any floating charge that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that
created it but which, on a proper interpretation, was re-characterised or rendered as a floating charge.

However, before distributing asset realizations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed
Part (as defined below) must, subject to certain exceptions, be set aside for distribution to unsecured
creditors;

    - Fifth ranking:

         - firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors and any secured creditor to the extent of
any unsecured shortfall, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts
up to the date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. To pay the
secured creditors any unsecured shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use
realizations from unsecured assets, as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution
from the Prescribed Part unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured
creditors;

         - secondly, interest on the company’s debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual
rate and the official rate) in respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation,
or after the commencement of any administration which had been converted into a
distributing administration. However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due
under the Notes or the guarantees, such interest due to the holders of the Notes may, if
there are sufficient realizations from the secured assets, be discharged out of such security
recoveries; and

         - thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the
categories above and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories
above are fully paid. This however does not include “currency conversion” claims
following the English Supreme Court Lehman Brothers ruling dated May 17, 2017; and

     - Sixth ranking: shareholders. If after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any
remaining funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company.

Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of
the subordination language in the relevant documentation.

An insolvency practitioner of the company (e.g., administrator, administrative receiver or liquidator)
will generally be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating
charge security for the benefit of unsecured creditors (after making full provision for preferential creditors
and expenses out of floating charge realizations) (the “Prescribed Part”). Under current law, this ring-fence
applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of floating charge realizations and 20% of the remainder over £10,000,
with a maximum aggregate cap of £600,000, or £800,000 in relation to floating charges which come into
existence on or after 6 April, 2020. The Prescribed Part must be made available to unsecured creditors
unless the cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors.

**_Challenges to Guarantees and Security_**

There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English
company of security and guarantees can be challenged. In most cases, this will only arise if the company is
placed into administration or liquidation within a specified period (as set out in more detail below) of the
granting of the guarantee or security. Therefore, if during the specified period an administrator or liquidator
is appointed to an English company, he may challenge the validity of the guarantee or security given by such
company.

The following potential grounds for challenge may apply to guarantees and charges:

**_Transaction at an Undervalue_**

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English company could apply to
the court for an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee if such liquidator or


-----

administrator believes that the creation of such security interest or guarantee constituted a transaction at
an undervalue. There will only be a transaction at an undervalue, if at the time of the transaction or as a result
of the transaction, the English company was or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in the Insolvency
Act 1986). The transaction can be challenged if the English company enters into liquidation or
administration proceedings within a period of two years (in the case of a transaction entered into between
the relevant company and a person who is “connected”with that company, within the meaning of Section 249
of the Insolvency Act 1986 (a “Connected Person”)) or six months (in the case of a transaction entered
into between the relevant company and any person who is not a Connected Person, including where such
beneficiary is a Connected Person by reason only of being the company’s employee) from the date the English
company grants the security interest or the guarantee. A transaction might be subject to being set aside as
a transaction at an undervalue if the company makes a gift to a person, if the company receives no
consideration or if the company receives consideration of significantly less value, in money or money’s
worth, than the consideration given by such company. However, a court generally will not intervene if it is
satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its
business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would
benefit it. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court can make
such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been in if the transaction had not
been entered into. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the English
company was insolvent unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a Connected Person, in which case
there is a presumption of insolvency and the Connected Person must demonstrate the solvency of the English
company in such proceedings. The Issuer cannot assure holders of the Notes that in the event of insolvency,
the granting of the security or the giving of the guarantees by companies incorporated under the laws of
England and Wales would not be challenged by a liquidator or administrator or that a court would support
the Group’s analysis that (in any event) the security and guarantees were entered into in good faith for the
purposes described above.

In general terms, in such circumstances the Courts of England and Wales have the power to make
void such transactions, or restore the position to what it would have been if the company had not entered
into the transaction. If a court voided any grant of security or giving of any guarantee as a result of a
transaction at an undervalue or preference, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, investors would
cease to have any security over the grantor or a claim against the Guarantor giving such guarantee.

**_Preference_**

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English company could apply to
the court for an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee if such liquidator or
administrator believes that the creation of such security interest or such guarantee constituted a preference.
There will only be a preference if, at the time of the transaction or as a result of the transaction, the
English company was or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in the Insolvency Act 1986). The
transaction can be challenged if the English company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings
within a period of six months (if the beneficiary of the security or the guarantee is not a Connected
Person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a Connected Person, except where such beneficiary is a connected
person by reason only of being the company’s employee) from the date the English company grants the
security interest or the guarantee. A transaction will constitute a factual preference if it has the effect of
putting a creditor of the English company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or
liabilities) in a better position (in the event of the company going into insolvent liquidation) than such
creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had that transaction not been entered into. If the
court determines that the transaction constituted such a preference, the court has very wide powers for
restoring the position to what it would have been if that preference had not been given, which could include
reducing payments under the Notes and the guarantees (although there is protection for a third party who
enters into one of the transactions in good faith and without notice). However, for the court to do so, it must
be shown that in deciding to give the factual preference the English company was influenced by a desire to
produce the preferential effect. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that
the English company was insolvent at the relevant time and that the company was influenced by a desire
to produce the preferential effect, unless the beneficiary of the transaction was a Connected Person, in which
case there is a presumption that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect
and the Connected Person must demonstrate in such proceedings that there was no such influence.

**_Transaction Defrauding Creditors_**

Under English insolvency law, where it can be shown that a transaction was at an undervalue and
was made for the purposes of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may make, a


-----

claim against a company, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of a person in relation to the claim,
which that person is making or may make, the transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction
defrauding creditors. This provision may be used by any person who claims to be a “victim”of the transaction
and, subject to certain conditions, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority and the U.K. Pensions Regulator,
and is not therefore limited to liquidators or administrators. There is no time limit in the English insolvency
legislation within which the challenge must be made (subject to the normal statutory limitations period) and
the relevant company does not need to be insolvent at the time of the transaction. If the court determines
that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make such orders as it thinks fit to
restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to protect
the interests of the victims of the transaction.

**_Extortionate Credit Transaction_**

An administrator or a liquidator can apply to court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction.
The court can review extortionate credit transactions entered into by an English Obligor up to three years
before the day on which the English Obligor entered into administration or went into liquidation. A
transaction is “extortionate” if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, the
terms of it are (or were) such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally
or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit or it otherwise grossly contravened
ordinary principles of fair dealing.

**_Grant of Floating Charge_**

Under English insolvency law, if an English Obligor is unable to pay its debts at the time of (or as
a result of) granting the floating charge, and the floating charge was granted within the specified period
referred to below, then such floating charge is invalid except to the extent of the value of the money paid to,
or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant English Obligor
at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge. The requirement for the English Obligor to be
insolvent at the time of (or as a result of) granting the floating charge does not apply where the floating
charge is granted to a Connected Person and within the specified period referred to below. If the floating
charge is granted to a Connected Person, and the floating charge was granted within the specified period
referred to below, then the floating charge is invalid except to the extent of the value of the money paid to, or
goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant English Obligor at
the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge, whether the relevant English Obligor is solvent or
insolvent. The granting of the charge can be challenged only if the relevant English Obligor enters into
liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of one year (if the beneficiary is not a Connected
Person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a Connected Person) from the date the relevant English Obligor
grants the floating charge. However, if the Floating Charge qualifies as a “financial collateral arrangement”
under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003, the floating charge will not be
subject to challenge as described in this paragraph. An administrator, or a liquidator (as applicable), does
not need to apply to court for an order declaring that a floating charge is invalid. Any floating charge created
during the relevant time period is automatically invalid except to the extent of the value of the money paid
to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant English company
at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge (plus certain interest), whether the relevant
English company is solvent or insolvent at the time of grant.

**_The Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020_**

On June 25, 2020, the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Bill 2020 received Royal Assent and
took effect as the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 on June 26, 2020 (the “Insolvency Act
**2020”) (save for certain temporary business protection measures which have retrospective effect from March 1,**
2020). The Insolvency Act 2020 introduced a number of substantial and permanent changes to the
insolvency regime of the United Kingdom including the following:

**_Moratorium_**

The Insolvency Act 2020 introduces a new standalone moratorium to facilitate company
restructurings. The entry into a moratorium for companies incorporated in England and Wales would be
similar to the current out of court administrator appointment procedure, i.e., filing papers at court. A
“moratorium monitor” (the “Monitor”) (an insolvency practitioner and officer of the court) will file their
consent to act and confirm that they have assessed the company’s eligibility and that all moratorium
qualifying conditions are satisfied. Costs incurred during a moratorium will be treated in the same way as


-----

expenses in an administration. Where a company exits a moratorium and subsequently enters administration
or liquidation, any unpaid moratorium costs will have super priority over any costs or claims in the
administration or liquidation, including the expense of those later procedures.

The moratorium is intended to enable the company to reach an agreement with creditors and the
Monitor will be obliged to monitor whether it remains likely that the moratorium will result in the rescue of
the company as a going concern (which is one of the eligibility criteria for a company to avail itself of the
moratorium).

The eligibility criteria require the directors to state that the company is, or is likely to become,
unable to pay its debts. A company which has entered into a moratorium, administration or company
voluntary arrangement in the last 12 months is not eligible to enter into a moratorium. Certain categories
of companies are excluded from being eligible (including those “excluded” as parties to capital markets
arrangements as more particularly described in the Insolvency Act 2020).

The moratorium shall last for an initial period of up to 20 business days beginning with the
business day after the day on which the moratorium comes into force, which may be extended (i) by the
directors, for a period of a further 20 business days, (ii) with creditor consent for a total period of a year
(including the initial 20 business day period), and (iii) by the court for an unlimited period.

The moratorium imposes a general restriction on the enforcement or payment of debts, insolvency
proceedings and legal proceedings and the crystallization of floating charges. The moratorium also impacts
the company’s ability to engage in a range of corporate acts including those which relate to obtaining
credit, the grant of security, entering into market contracts, payment of certain pre-moratorium debts,
disposal of property, disposal of hire-purchase property and disposal of charged property free from charge.

The Monitor can terminate the moratorium on various grounds, including if the Monitor thinks
that the moratorium is no longer likely to result in the rescue of the company as a going concern, or is
unable to pay moratorium debts, or pre-moratorium debts for which the company does not have a payment
holiday, as and when those debts fall due.

Creditors and other persons affected by the moratorium are entitled to apply to the court to
challenge the Monitor’s actions. A creditor or member of the company may challenge the conduct of or
continuation of the moratorium on the ground that the interests of the company’s creditors or members
generally are being unfairly harmed.

**_Certain Ipso Facto Clauses To Be Rendered Ineffective_**

The Insolvency Act 2020 renders ineffective termination clauses in contracts for the supply of
goods and services where the termination clause is activated by the purchaser of the goods or services
becoming subject to a formal insolvency procedure (so-called ‘ipso facto’ clauses). This provision does not
apply in relation to certain types of financial contracts, or where the company or the supplier are engaged in
certain types of financial services.

**_Restructuring Plan_**

The Insolvency Act 2020 introduces a new restructuring process under Part 26A of the
U.K. Companies Act 2006, which is broadly similar to, and intended to follow the same process as, a
scheme of arrangement but with an ability for cross class cramdown.

This standalone restructuring plan will be available to certain companies that have encountered, or
are likely to encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, their ability to carry on
business as a going concern. The compromise or arrangement proposed in the plan must have as its
purpose the elimination, reduction or prevention of, or mitigation of the effect of, any such financial
difficulties.

The process closely resembles that for a scheme of arrangement. However, unlike a scheme of
arrangement, to commence this process, a restructuring plan proposal can be made not only by the
company, but also any creditor or member of the company, or if the company is being wound up, the
liquidator, or if the company is in administration, the administrator. Every creditor or member whose rights
are affected should be able to participate in a meeting. Creditors will be divided into classes based on the
similarity or otherwise of their rights prior to the restructuring plan and following implementation of the
plan and the court must approve the formation of any such classes.


-----

At a first hearing, the court may order the holding of a meeting of creditors, classes of creditors,
members or class of members. Before that meeting, a statement must be provided to the creditors, class of
creditors or class of members (as applicable) which statement must explain the effect of the compromise or
arrangement. At the meeting, the requisite voting threshold of 75% in value of the creditors, class of
creditors or members (as applicable) present and voting must be met before, at a second hearing, the court
will consider whether to sanction the compromise or arrangement.

Where a compromise or arrangement is approved by 75% in value of a class of creditors or
members (as applicable) present and voting who would receive a payment or have a genuine economic
interest in the company in the event of the “relevant alternative” (i.e., whatever the court considers would
be most likely to occur in relation to the company if the restructuring plan were not sanctioned) then the court
may still sanction the scheme even if one or more classes of creditors or members did not vote in favor of
it, thereby “cramming-down” dissenting classes, if: (i) the court is satisfied that none of the members of the
dissenting class would be any worse off under the restructuring plan than they would be in the event of
the “relevant alternative”; and (ii) the restructuring plan has been approved by a number representing 75%
in value of a class of creditors or members (as applicable), present and voting, who would receive a payment,
or have a genuine economic interest in the company, in the event of the relevant alternative referred to in
(i) above.

The restructuring plan must then be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court
will review the fairness of the restructuring plan and consider what is reasonable. The court retains discretion
to sanction a restructuring plan as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made
or reject the restructuring plan.

**_Statutory Demands and Winding-Up Petitions_**

Under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act 1986 certain transactions, including any disposition of
the company’s property and any transfer of shares made after the commencement of a winding-up, unless
sanctioned by the court, are void. Where a creditor makes a winding-up petition during the period set out
above and the court makes an order for a winding-up of the company, the Insolvency Act 2020 shifts the
point in time at which a winding-up will be deemed to commence for the purposes of Section 127 of the
Insolvency Act 1986 from the time of the presentation of the winding-up petition to the making of the
winding-up order. Therefore, transactions that are entered into after the presentation of a winding-up
petition during the ‘relevant period’ but prior to the making of the winding-up order will not be void.

**_Ranking of Security Interests_**

Under English law, there are certain common law rules and equitable principles which will
determine the ranking of two or more competing security interests over the same assets. A number of
different factors are taken into account, such as the nature of the security interest, the order of creation,
compliance with perfection requirements and the order of giving notice. English law security interests are to
be granted to secure obligations under the Notes (which will also extend to obligations under the Existing
Senior Secured Term Loans, the New Senior Secured Term Loans, the Existing Senior Secured Notes, certain
hedging liabilities and certain cash management liabilities); these security interests will be granted over the
same assets in respect of which security interests have already been granted in favor of the lenders under the
Existing Senior Secured Term Loans and the holders of the Existing Senior Secured Notes. Accordingly,
without the Intercreditor Deed, these new security interests would be likely to rank after the existing security
interests. However, the Intercreditor Deed provides that as a contractual matter as among Senior Creditors
(as defined in the Intercreditor Deed) the Notes will be secured on a pari passu basis with the Existing
Senior Secured Term Loans, the New Senior Secured Term Loans, the Existing Senior Secured Notes, certain
hedging liabilities and certain cash management liabilities and will be treated as such for the purposes of
the application of proceeds from the enforcement of such assets.

**_Disclaimer_**

An English liquidator has the power to disclaim onerous property, which is any unprofitable
contract or other property of the company that cannot be sold, readily sold or may give rise to a liability to
pay money or perform any other onerous act. A contract may be unprofitable if it gives rise to prospective
liabilities and imposes continuing financial obligations on a company that may be detrimental to creditors.
However, this power does not apply to an executed contract, nor can it disturb accrued rights and liabilities.


-----

**_Limitation on Enforcement_**

The grant of a guarantee or Collateral by any of the English Obligors in respect of the obligations
of another group company must satisfy certain legal requirements. More specifically, such a transaction
must be allowed by the respective company’s memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that
these documents do not allow such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee and the
subsequent security can be found to be void and the respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort
may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with an English Obligor in good faith; however, the
relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be
established for each English Obligor in question by virtue of entering into the proposed transaction.
Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in the way that he considers, in
good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the English Obligor for the benefit of its members
as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit,
they may be found as abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being
set aside by a court.

**_Security Over Shares_**

Security over shares granted by an English Obligor or over shares of an English Obligor are, under
English law, equitable charges, not legal charges. An equitable charge arises where a chargor creates an
encumbrance over the property in favor of the chargee but the chargor retains legal title to the shares.
Remedies in relation to equitable charges may be subject to equitable considerations or are otherwise at the
discretion of the court.

**_Security Over Bank Accounts_**

With respect to any security over bank accounts (each, an “Account Charge”) granted by an
English Obligor, the banks with which some of those accounts are held (each, an “Account Bank”) may
hold a right at any time (at least prior to them being notified of a crystallization event under the Account
Charge) to exercise the rights of netting or set-off to which they are entitled under their cash pooling or other
arrangements with that guarantor. As a result, and if the security granted over those accounts is merely a
floating (rather than fixed) charge, the collateral constituted by those bank accounts will be subject to the
relevant Account Bank’s rights to exercise netting and set-off with respect to the bank accounts charged
under the relevant Account Charge. Once the floating charge has crystallised and converted into a fixed
charge (as it would on enforcement or the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the relevant
English Obligor) and the Account Bank has been formally notified of that fact, the collateral will no
longer be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s netting and set-off rights.

**_Company Voluntary Arrangements_**

Pursuant to Part I of the Insolvency Act 1986, a company (by its directors or its administrator or
liquidator as applicable) may propose a company voluntary arrangement to the company’s shareholders
and creditors which entails a compromise, or other arrangement, between the company and its creditors,
typically a rescheduling or reducing of the company’s debts. Provided that the proposal is approved by the
requisite majority of creditors by way of a decision procedure, it will bind all unsecured creditors who were
entitled to vote on the proposal. A company voluntary arrangement cannot affect the right of a secured
creditor to enforce its security, or of a preferential creditor to be paid in priority to non-preferential creditors
(see “—Priority on insolvency”), except with the consent of the secured creditor or the preferential
creditor (as applicable).

In order for the company voluntary arrangement proposal to be passed, it must be approved by at
least 75% (by value) of the company’s creditors who respond in the decision procedure, and no more than
50% (by value) of unconnected creditors may vote against it. Secured debt cannot be voted in a company
voluntary arrangement. However, a secured creditor may vote to the extent that it is undersecured. A
secured creditor who proves in the company voluntary arrangement for the whole of its debt may be deemed
to have given up its security.

**_Scheme of Arrangement_**

Although it is not an insolvency proceeding, pursuant to Part 26 of the U.K. Companies Act 2006,
the English courts have jurisdiction to sanction a scheme of arrangement that effects a compromise of a
company’s liabilities between a company and its creditors (or any class of its creditors). An English Obligor
may be able to pursue a scheme in respect of its financial liabilities. In addition, a foreign Guarantor


-----

which is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act 1986 and has a “sufficient connection” to England
and Wales could also pursue a scheme. In practice, a foreign company is likely to satisfy the first limb of
this test and the second limb has been found to be satisfied where, amongst other things, the company’s
COMI is in England or Wales, the company’s finance documents are English law-governed, or the company’s
finance documents have been amended in accordance with their terms to be governed by English law.
Ultimately, each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not
necessarily determine whether or not any of the grounds of the second limb are satisfied in the present case.

Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement at a hearing where the fairness
and reasonableness of the scheme will be considered, affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise
or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the
rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such creditors
are given under the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If a
majority in number representing 75% or more by value of those creditors present and voting at the meeting(s)
of each class of creditors vote in favor of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approved
thresholds contained in the finance documents, then that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the court)
be binding on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote and
those who voted against the scheme. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction
hearing where the court will review the fairness of the scheme and consider whether it is reasonable. The court
has the discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon
modifications being made or reject the scheme.

**France**

Security over shares held by INEOS Investments International Limited in certain of its French
subsidiaries shall be pledged under French law. Therefore, an insolvency event (including any insolvency
proceedings resulting therefrom) affecting such French subsidiaries may significantly reduce the value of such
security interests for their beneficiaries. In the event of an insolvency event affecting such French
subsidiaries, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in France and would then be governed by French law
(subject to the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation (see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the
Guarantees and the Security Interests—European Union”)).

**_Trust_**

The security interests governed by French law are stated to be granted in favor of Barclays Bank
PLC as trustee and security agent on behalf of the specified secured parties. There is no established concept
of “trust” or “trustee” under the present French legal system. A concept of “trust” has been recognized
for tax purposes by article 792-0 bis of the Code Général des Impôts and the French Supreme Court (Cour
_de cassation) has held, in a decision dated September 13, 2011 rendered in the context of safeguard proceedings_
in France, that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by the laws of the State of New York
could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings opening in France. However, France has
not ratified the 1985 The Hague Convention on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition, so that
the concept of “trust” has not been generally recognized under French law and the precise nature, effect
and enforceability of the duties, rights and powers of a security agent as agent or trustee for noteholders in
respect of security interests such as pledges are unclear under French law.

**_Parallel Debt_**

Under French law, certain “accessory” security interests such as pledges require that the pledgee
and the creditor be the same person. Such security interests cannot be held on behalf of the creditors by
third parties who do not hold the secured claim, unless they act as trustees (fiduciaires) under Article 2011
of the French Civil Code or as security agents (agent des sûretés) under Article 2488-6 of the French Civil
Code, which is not the case here for the security documents governed by French law. The holders of
interests in the Notes from time to time will not be parties to the security documents. In order to permit the
holders of the Notes to benefit indirectly from a secured claim, the Indenture will provide for the creation
of a “parallel debt” governed by New York law in favor of the security trustee. Pursuant to such parallel debt,
the security trustee becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by a relevant obligor
under the Indenture. The pledges governed by French law will directly secure the parallel debt, and will not
directly secure the obligations under the Notes and the other indebtedness secured by the Collateral.

Although the concept of parallel debt was held to be not incompatible with the French law
concept of international public policy in a French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) decision dated


-----

September 13, 2011 in the context of safeguard proceedings opened in France, this decision cannot be
considered as a general recognition of the enforceability in France of the rights of a security trustee benefiting
from a parallel debt obligation and no assurance can be given that such a structure will in all circumstances
be upheld by the French courts. Indeed, it should be noted that the legal issue addressed by this decision
is limited to the proof of claims. The French court was not asked to generally uphold French security interests
securing a parallel debt. Case law on this matter is scarce and based on a case-by-case analysis.

There is no certainty that the parallel debt construct will eliminate or mitigate the risk of
unenforceability under French law. To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created under
the parallel debt construct are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not receive
any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral, which in turn could materially
adversely affect the recovery under the Collateral. In addition, the holders of the Notes will bear the risks
associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the security trustee.

**_Assumptions as to the enforceability of thirteenth ranking financial securities account pledges over the shares_**
**_of INEOS Technologies France SAS and fourteenth ranking financial securities account pledges over the shares_**
**_of INEOS France SAS_**

Each of the pledges over the shares of INEOS Technologies France SAS and INEOS France SAS,
governed by French law, is a pledge over the relevant securities account (nantissement de compte de titres
_financiers) in which the shares of INEOS Technologies France SAS and INEOS France SAS are respectively_
registered. In France, no lien searches are available for security interests which are not registered, such as
pledges over securities accounts (nantissements de comptes de titres financiers). As a result, no assurance can
be given on the priority of the pledges over the relevant securities account in which the shares of INEOS
Technologies France SAS and INEOS France SAS are respectively registered.

Prior to January 1, 2022, French law did not expressly mention the possibility of granting lower
ranking or subsequent pledges over a securities account already subject to a first ranking security interest.
As the granting of a pledge of a securities account pursuant to French law is deemed to remove the securities
registered on such account from the possession of the pledgor and grant possession to the pledgee, some
scholars and practitioners regarded the granting of such lower or subsequent pledges as requiring the
appointment, by the beneficiaries of such lower ranking or subsequent pledges, of the beneficiaries of the
first ranking secured interest as a “tiers convenu” (entiercement), whose role was to hold such possession for
the benefit of all secured creditors (regardless of the ranking). Since January 1, 2022, article L.211-20 I.bis
of the French Monetary and Financial Code expressly mentions the possibility of several successive pledges
of the same securities account and provides that the ranking among creditors will be determined pursuant
to the date of the statements of pledges of lower ranking or subsequent rankings to the financial securities
account holder.

Although French law now recognizes the possibility of granting subsequent pledges without any
appointment of a tiers convenu and because the agreements granting the first, second, third, fourth, fifth,
sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh and twelfth ranking pledges and (with respect to the shares of
INEOS France SAS) the thirteenth ranking pledge provide for the appointment of tiers convenu in order to
comply with the previous practice (described above) which was prevailing among scholars and practitioners
at the time of execution of such agreements, the thirteenth ranking financial securities account pledge
agreement of the shares of INEOS Technologies France SAS and the fourteenth ranking financial securities
account pledge agreement of the shares of INEOS France SAS also provide that (i) the possession of the
securities accounts is transferred to the custody of an agreed third party as tiers convenu and (ii) the first
ranking secured parties have accepted their appointment as tiers convenu and hold the pledged securities as
custodian for the benefit of the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth,
eleventh and twelfth ranking secured parties and (with respect to the fourteenth ranking financial securities
account pledge agreement over the shares of INEOS France SAS) the thirteenth ranking secured parties.
No assurance can be given that such tiers convenu would be upheld if tested in front of a French court.

**Germany**

**_Insolvency_**

Certain Guarantors of the Notes or providers of security for the Notes are organized or
incorporated under the laws of Germany (the “German Guarantors”). Consequently, in the event of an
insolvency of any such Guarantor, subject to the information presented in “—European Union,” insolvency
proceedings may be initiated in Germany. Such proceedings would then be governed by German law.
However, pursuant to the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, where a German company conducts business


-----

in more than one member state of the European Union, the jurisdiction of the German courts may be
limited if the company’s COMI is found to be in a member state other than Germany (see “—European
Union”). There are a number of factors that are taken into account to ascertain the COMI, which should
correspond to the place where the company conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and
is therefore ascertainable by third parties. The point at which this issue falls to be determined is at the time
that the relevant insolvency proceedings are opened. The insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the
provisions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) may be less favorable to your interests as
creditors than the insolvency law of other jurisdictions including in respect of the priority of creditors, the
ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceedings.

Under German law, insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in
the event of over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) or illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) of the debtor. If for
example a stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft—AG) or a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit
_beschränkter Haftung—GmbH) is in a situation of illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness, the management of_
such company is obligated to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings without undue delay, however,
in the case of illiquidity at the latest within three weeks after illiquidity occurred and in case of overindebtedness at the latest six weeks after-over-indebtedness occurred. The debtor is over-indebted if its
liabilities exceed the value of its assets (based on their liquidation value) unless a continuation of the debtor’s
business is predominantly likely (überwiegend wahrscheinlich) for a prognosis period covering the next
12 months (positive Fortbestehensprognose). The debtor is illiquid if it is unable to pay its debts as and when
they fall due. In addition, the debtor may, but is not obliged to, file for insolvency proceedings if it is
imminently at risk to be unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit).

Once illiquidity or over-indebtedness occurs, any payments, including any payments under the
Guarantees by the German Guarantors, are voidable (but see also below “—Hardening Periods and
_Fraudulent Transfer”)._

The insolvency proceedings are court-controlled, and upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the
insolvency court may take preliminary protective measures to secure the property of the debtor during the
preliminary proceedings. The insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce
individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary proceedings and may appoint a
preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter) who, depending on the court decision,
may have the right to manage and dispose of the business and assets of the debtor. During preliminary
insolvency proceedings, depending on the size of the debtor’s business operations, the insolvency court must
or may appoint a “preliminary creditors’ committee” (vorläufiger Gläubigerausschuss). The requirements
apply to the respective entity without taking into account the assets of other group companies. If these
requirements are not met, a preliminary creditors’ committee can be established at the request of the
preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter) or a creditor. The preliminary creditors’
committee will be able to participate in certain important insolvency court decisions. It will have, for
example, the power to influence the following: the selection of a preliminary insolvency administrator or an
insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter and Insolvenzverwalter), orders for “debtor-inpossession” proceedings (Anordnung der Eigenverwaltung), and appointments of preliminary trustees
(Sachwalter). The court opens the insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnung) if certain formal requirements
are met and if there are sufficient assets to cover at least the costs of the proceedings. If the assets of the
debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only open formal insolvency proceedings
if third parties, for instance creditors, advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the
petition for opening of insolvency proceedings will usually be refused for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung
_mangels Masse). If formal insolvency proceedings are opened, the court appoints an insolvency_
administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) unless debtor-in-possession (Eigenverwaltung) is ordered. In the absence
of debtor-in-possession proceedings, the right to administer the debtor’s business affairs and to dispose of the
assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency administrator. The insolvency administrator has full power to
manage the business and dispose of the debtor’s assets, whereas the debtor is no longer entitled to manage the
business or dispose of its assets. The insolvency administrator may raise new financial indebtedness and
incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s operations or may deem it necessary to wind down the company,
and satisfaction of these liabilities as preferential debts of the estate (Masseschulden) will be preferred to
any insolvency liabilities created by the debtor (including secured debt).

From the perspective of the holders of the Notes, among others, some relevant consequences of
such opening of formal insolvency proceedings that are subject to the German insolvency regime (against a
German Guarantor or against any other Guarantor having its COMI in Germany and where the German
insolvency courts have jurisdiction in accordance with the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation or the German
Insolvency Code) would be the following:


-----

     - if the court does not order a debtor-in-possession proceeding, the right to administer and
dispose of the assets of the relevant German Guarantor and any of its subsidiaries would
generally pass to the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative of the
insolvency estate;

     - if the court does not order a debtor-in-possession proceeding with respect to the relevant
German Guarantor and any of its subsidiaries, disposals effected by the management of such
German Guarantor and any of its subsidiaries after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings
are null and void by operation of law;

     - if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings or thereafter, a
creditor in the insolvency proceedings has acquired through execution (e.g., attachment) a security
interest in part of the relevant German Guarantor’s or any of its subsidiaries’ property that
would normally form part of the insolvency estate, such security becomes null and void by
operation of law upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings; and

    - claims against the relevant German Guarantor and any of its subsidiaries may only be pursued
in accordance with the rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code.

Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or “escape
clauses” entitling one party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an
agreement, upon the opening of insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency
or the occurrence of reasons justifying the opening of insolvency proceedings (insolvenzbezogene
_Kündigungsrechte or Lösungsklauseln) may be invalid if they frustrate the election right of the insolvency_
administrator whether or not to perform the contract unless they reflect termination rights applicable under
statutory law. This may also relate to agreements that are not governed by German law in the event
insolvency proceedings are opened in Germany against the counterparty. Also, powers of attorney granted
by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective upon the opening of insolvency
proceedings. Certain executory contracts become unenforceable at such time unless and until the insolvency
administrator opts for performance.

All creditors, whether secured or unsecured, unless they have a right to segregate an asset from the
insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht)—as opposed to a right of preferential satisfaction from realisation
proceeds (Absonderungsrecht, see below)—who wish to assert claims against the debtor need to participate in
the insolvency proceedings. Any individual enforcement action (Zwangsvollstreckung) brought against the
debtor by any of its creditors other than creditors with preferred claims (Absonderung der
_Masseverbindlichkeiten) is subject to an automatic stay once insolvency proceedings have been opened._
Secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce their security interests outside the insolvency
proceedings. In the insolvency proceedings however, secured creditors have certain preferential rights
(Absonderungsrechte). Depending on the legal nature of the security interest, entitlement to enforce such
security is either vested with the secured creditor or the insolvency administrator. The insolvency
administrator generally has the sole right to realize any movable assets in his, her or the debtor’s possession
that are subject to preferential rights (e.g., liens over movable assets (Mobiliarsicherungsrechte), or security
transfer of title (Sicherungsübereignung)) as well as to collect any claims that are subject to security assignment
agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). This will also apply to security over certain types of stock. If the
enforcement right is vested with the insolvency administrator, the enforcement proceeds are disbursed to
the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims,
however less certain contributory charges for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten)
and (ii) realizing the secured assets (Verwertungskosten) which, in the aggregate, usually add up to 9% of the
gross enforcement proceeds plus VAT (if any). With the remaining unencumbered assets of the debtor the
insolvency administrator has first to satisfy the preferential creditors of the insolvency estate (Massegläubiger)
(including the costs of the insolvency proceedings as well as any preferred liabilities incurred by the
insolvency estate after, or with permission of the insolvency court prior to, the opening of formal insolvency
proceedings). Thereafter, all other unsubordinated claims (insolvency claims) (Insolvenzforderungen), will
be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there is cash remaining in the insolvent estate
(Insolvenzmasse) after the security interest and the preferential claims against the estate have been settled
and paid in full. Therefore, the proceeds resulting from the realisation of the insolvency estate of the debtor
may not be sufficient to satisfy unsecured creditors of the relevant German Guarantor or under a guarantee
granted by such German Guarantor in full after the preferred and secured creditors have been satisfied.
Claims of subordinated creditors in the insolvency proceedings (nachrangige Insolvenzgläubiger) are
satisfied only after the claims of other non-subordinated creditors (including the unsecured insolvency
claims) have been fully satisfied (see also below “—Satisfaction of Subordinated Claims”).


-----

A different distribution of enforcement proceeds can be proposed in an insolvency plan
(Insolvenzplan). Such plan can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and requires,
among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the consent of the debtor and the consent of each class
of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules and the approval of the insolvency court. The
insolvency court may order the deemed approval of one or more opposing creditor groups under certain
conditions (cram down). The insolvency plan may derogate from the provisions of the German Insolvency
Code. In particular, it may contain provisions regarding the discharge of secured and unsecured creditors, the
disposal of the insolvency estate as well as procedure. It may also create, modify, transfer or terminate
rights in rem such as property rights or security interests. If the debtor is a corporate entity, the shares or, as
the case may be, the membership rights in the debtor can also be included in the insolvency plan, e.g., these
can be transferred to third parties, including a transfer to creditors based on a debt-to-equity swap. Thus, an
insolvency plan could under certain circumstances provide for provisions regarding the Guarantees or the
Collateral which are less favorable to the holders of the Notes than the provisions of the German Insolvency
Code, such as the release of the Collateral, the release of obligations under the Guarantees of the German
Guarantors or the contribution of the Guarantees of the German Guarantors in exchange for equity. Under
certain conditions, such provisions could be adopted against the votes of the affected holders of the
Notes.

Moreover, if the debtor has filed a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings based on a
reason for the insolvency other than illiquidity (i.e., imminent illiquidity or over-indebtedness), combined
with a petition to initiate such process based on a debtor-in-possession proceeding and can demonstrate that
a restructuring of its business is not obviously futile, the court may grant a period of up to three months
to draw up an insolvency plan for the debtor business (Schutzschirmverfahren). During this period, the
creditors’ rights to enforce security may—upon application of the filing debtor—be suspended. Under these
circumstances, the insolvency court must appoint a preliminary custodian to supervise the process. The
debtor is entitled to suggest an individual to be appointed as custodian with such suggestion being binding
on the insolvency court unless the suggested person is obviously not eligible to become a custodian (i.e., he or
she is obviously not competent or impartial).

Under German insolvency law, there is no consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of
companies in the event of insolvency. In case of a group of companies, each entity, from an insolvency law
point of view, has to be dealt with separately (i.e., there is generally no group insolvency concept under
German insolvency law). As a consequence, there is, in particular, no pooling of claims among the respective
entities of a group, but rather claims of and vis-à-vis each entity have to be dealt with separately. On April 21,
2018, the Bill to Facilitate the Handling of Group Insolvencies (Gesetz zur Erleichterung der Bewältigung
_von Konzerninsolvenzen) entered into force. While the bill does not abolish the principle of separate insolvency_
proceedings in relation to each group entity, it provides for the following four key amendments of the
German Insolvency Code in order to facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies: (i) a single
court may be competent for each group entity’s insolvency proceeding; (ii) the appointment of a single
person as insolvency administrator for all group companies is facilitated; (iii) certain coordination obligations
are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and creditors’ committees; and (iv) certain
parties may apply for “coordination proceedings” (Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a
“coordination insolvency administrator”(Koordinationsverwalter) with the ability to propose a “coordination
plan” (Koordinationsplan).

German insolvency law provides for certain creditors to be subordinated by law (in particular, but
not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the relevant debtor for the return of
funds or payment of a consideration), while claims of a person who becomes a creditor of the insolvency
estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings generally rank senior to the claims of regular,
unsecured creditors. See also below under “—Satisfaction of Subordinated Claims”.

**_Limitation on Enforcement_**

The Guarantors of the Notes that are organized under German law are incorporated or established
in the form of a GmbH (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung, Limited Liability Company). Consequently,
the grant of Collateral by these Guarantors is subject to certain provisions of the German Limited
Liability Company Act (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung, the “GmbHG”).
These provisions would also apply to any future Guarantor in the form of a GmbH, or in case of a private
limited partnership with a limited liability company as general partner (Kommanditgesellschaft) (“GmbH &
**Co. KG”) to its general partner.**


-----

Sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG (“Sections 30 and 31”) prohibit a GmbH from disbursing its
assets to its shareholders to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s net assets determined in accordance
with the provisions of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, the HGB) (i.e., assets minus
liabilities and liability reserves) is or would fall below the amount of its stated share capital (Begründung
_einer Unterbilanz) or would increase any already existing capital impairment (Vertiefung einer Unterbilanz)._
Guarantees, share pledges and any other collateral granted by a GmbH in order to guarantee or secure
liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company are considered disbursements under Sections 30
and 31. Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to grant guarantees and collateral to secure
liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Sections 30 and 31, it
is standard market practice for credit agreements, indentures, guarantees and security documents to
contain so-called “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries in the legal form of a GmbH or a
GmbH & Co. KG. Pursuant to such limitation language, the beneficiaries of the guarantees and security
interests agree, subject to certain exemptions, to enforce the guarantees and security interests against the
GmbH or the GmbH & Co. KG (or retain the proceeds of an enforcement of the security interests) only to
the extent that such enforcement does not result in the GmbH’s, or the KG’s general partner that is a
GmbH, net assets falling below its stated share capital or, as the case may be, if the net assets are already
below the amount of its stated share capital, to cause such amount to be further reduced. Accordingly, the
Guarantees and security interests provided by a German Guarantor to secure the Notes will contain such
limitation language and therefore the enforcement of the Guarantees and the security interests securing
the Notes is limited in the manner described. This could lead to a situation in which the respective Guarantee
or security interest granted by a German Guarantor cannot be enforced at all. Details of the application
of Sections 30 and 31 (or capital maintenance rules) are subject to evolving case law. Furthermore, it cannot
be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) regarding
so-called destructive interference (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation where a shareholder
deprives a German limited liability company of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own payment
obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of a guarantee or security interest
granted by a German (direct or indirect) subsidiary or sister company of the Issuer. In such case, the amount
of proceeds to be realized in an enforcement process may be reduced, even to zero.

German capital maintenance rules are subject to ongoing court decisions. We cannot assure you
that future court rulings may not further limit the access of shareholders to assets of its subsidiaries
constituted in the form of a GmbH or of a limited partnership, the general partner or general partners of
which is or are a GmbH incorporated or established in Germany, which can negatively affect the ability of the
German Guarantors to make payments on the relevant Guarantees, of the secured parties to enforce the
Collateral (or retain the proceeds of an enforcement of the Collateral) or of the beneficiaries of the relevant
Guarantees to enforce the relevant Guarantees.

In addition to the limitations resulting from the capital maintenance rules, the Guarantees and the
security documents entered into by the German Guarantors will contain additional provisions which may
limit the enforcement in the event the enforcement would result in an illiquidity of the relevant German
Guarantors.

**_Parallel Debt_**

Under German law, certain “accessory” security interests such as pledges (Pfandrechte) require that
the pledgee and the creditor of the secured claim be the same person. Such accessory security interests
(akzessorische Sicherungsrechte) cannot be held on behalf of third parties who do not (yet) hold the secured
claim, will automatically lapse to the extent a secured claim is settled, discharged or novated, and may not
be assigned independently, but will automatically follow the claims they secure in case the relevant secured
claim is assigned. The holders of the Notes from time to time will not be party to the security documents.
In order to permit the holders of the Notes from time to time to benefit from pledges granted to the Security
Trustee under German law, the Intercreditor Deed provides for the creation of “parallel debt.” Pursuant to
the creation of the parallel debt, the Security Trustee has its own separate and independent claim equal to
each amount payable by each obligor under, in particular, the Notes and the Guarantees. The pledges
governed by German law will directly and exclusively (to the extent the Notes are concerned) secure the
parallel debt rather than the obligations under the Notes or the holders of the Notes directly. The validity
of the parallel debt concept and of the pledges granted under German law to secure such parallel debt has not
been tested before higher German courts, and there is no certainty that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk
of unenforceability posed by German law. Therefore, the ability of the Security Trustee to enforce the
Collateral may be restricted. In addition, holders of the Notes bear some risk associated with a possible
insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Trustee.


-----

German law does not generally permit the appropriation of pledged assets by the pledgee upon
enforcement of the pledge. The enforcement of a share pledge under German law usually requires the sale
of the asset constituting the collateral through a formal process involving a public auction to which certain
waiting periods and notice requirements apply. Under German law, it is unclear whether the security
interest in the collateral gives the Security Trustee the right to prevent other creditors of the entities having
granted such security from foreclosing on and realizing the asset constituting the collateral. Some courts have
held that certain types of security interests only give their holders priority (according to their ranking) in
the distribution of any proceeds from the realisation of the asset constituting the collateral and no right to
intervene (i.e., the right to request the court to impose a stay on proceedings initiated by other creditors).

**_Satisfaction of Subordinated Claims_**

The insolvency estate shall serve to satisfy the liquidated claims held by the personal creditors
against the debtor on the date when the insolvency proceedings were opened. The following claims shall be
satisfied ranking below the other claims of insolvency creditors in the order given below, and according to the
proportion of their amounts if ranking with equal status: (i) interest and penalty payments accrued on the
claims of the insolvency creditors from the day of the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (ii) costs incurred
by individual insolvency creditors due to their participation in the proceedings; (iii) fines, regulatory fines,
coercive fines and administrative fines, as well as such incidental legal consequences of a criminal or
administrative offence binding the debtor to pay money; (iv) claims to the debtor’s gratuitous performance
of a consideration; and (v) claims for restitution of a shareholder loan (Gesellschafterdarlehen) or claims
resulting from legal transactions corresponding in economic terms to such a loan unless a state aid bank
or any of its subsidiaries which is a shareholder of the relevant company have granted the respective loan or
legal transaction corresponding in economic terms to such a loan.

**_Ranking of Security Interests_**

Under German law, the ranking of several security interests over the same assets is determined, as
a matter of law, by the timing of the perfection of the several security interests, and security interests
perfected at an earlier point in time will have a higher rank than security interests granted at a later point in
time over the same assets (Prioritätsgrundsatz). The German law security interests granted to secure the
Notes are expressed to cover the same assets as the security interests already granted to secure the obligations
under the Existing Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Term Loans, certain hedging liabilities and
certain cash management liabilities. Whereas the German law “non-accessory” security interests granted to
secure the obligations under the Notes will be granted by way of confirmations and/or amendments to
the security purpose under the existing security interests granted originally to secure the obligations under
the Existing Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Term Loans, certain hedging liabilities and certain
cash management liabilities, with the effect that the obligations under the Notes will be included in the
security purpose and accordingly also be secured, the German law “accessory” security interests to secure
the obligations under the Notes will have to be granted as junior ranking security interests, which, as a matter
of law will rank below the corresponding accessory security interests granted to secure the obligations
under the Existing Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Term Loans, certain hedging liabilities and
certain cash management liabilities. Although the Intercreditor Deed provides that, as amongst the parties,
security interests to secure obligations under the Notes, Existing Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured
Term Loans, certain hedging liabilities and certain cash management liabilities shall rank pari passu, these
provisions under the Intercreditor Deed are only of an obligatory nature and cannot enhance the junior
rank of the accessory security interests (e.g., the pledges over bank accounts, shares and partnership interests)
granted to secure the obligations under the Notes. In the event of insolvency proceedings opened under
German law against a security grantor of such junior ranking accessory security interests, the preferential
rights of the secured parties under such junior ranking security interests would be satisfied after the
preferential rights of the secured parties under the senior ranking accessory security interests over the same
assets, regardless of the provisions of the Intercreditor Deed.

Under German law, it is unclear whether all of the security interests in the Collateral give the
Security Trustee a right to prevent other creditors of the German Guarantors from foreclosing into and
realizing the Collateral. Some courts have held that certain types of security interests only give their holders
priority (according to their rank) in the distribution of any proceeds of such realisation. Accordingly, the
Security Trustee and the holders of the Notes may not be able to avoid foreclosure by unsecured creditors into
the Collateral, even if they consider such foreclosure untimely.

**_Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer_**

In the event that insolvency proceedings with respect to a German Guarantor, which would most
likely be based on and governed by the insolvency laws of Germany, the security interests granted as well as


-----

the guarantee provided by that entity could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator
(Insolvenzverwalter) under the rules of avoidance as set out in the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung).

Based on these rules, an insolvency administrator may challenge transactions that are deemed
detrimental to insolvency creditors and were effected prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings.
Such transactions can include the payment of any amounts to the holders of the Notes as well as granting
them any security interest. The administrator’s right to challenge transactions can, depending on the
circumstances, extend to transactions during the 10-year period prior to the filing of the petition for
commencement of insolvency proceedings. In the event such a transaction is successfully avoided, the holders
of the Notes would be under an obligation to repay the amounts received or to waive the guarantee or
security interest. In such case, holders of the Notes may not be able to recover any amounts under the
Guarantees or the Collateral. If payments have already been made under the Guarantees or in respect of
Collateral, the insolvency administrator or custodian may require that the recipients return the payment to
the insolvency estate and holders of the Notes would instead then only have a general unsecured claim under
the Guarantees without preference in insolvency proceedings (unless and to the extent the Collateral
would not be subject to voidness in which case such claim would be secured to that extent).

In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which term includes the
provision of security or the repayment of debt) may be avoided in the following cases:

     - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or
satisfaction (i) if such act was performed during the last three months prior to the filing of the
petition for the commencement of the insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid
(zahlungsunfähig) at the time when such act was taken and the creditor had knowledge of such
illiquidity (or of the circumstances that unmistakably suggest that the debtor was illiquid) at such
time, or (ii) if such act was performed after the filing of the petition for the commencement of
the insolvency proceedings and the creditor had knowledge of the illiquidity of the debtor or the
filing of such petition (or of circumstances unmistakably suggesting such illiquidity or filing);

     - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or
satisfaction to which such creditor was not entitled or which was granted or obtained in a
form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was not entitled to such security or satisfaction
if (i) such act was performed during the last month prior to the filing of the petition for the
commencement of the insolvency proceedings or after such filing, (ii) such act was performed
during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was illiquid at
such time, or (iii) such act was performed during the second or third month prior to the filing
of the petition for the commencement of the insolvency proceedings and the creditor knew at the
time such act was taken that such act was detrimental to the other insolvency creditors (or had
knowledge of circumstances that unmistakably suggest such detrimental effects);

     - any transaction by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by which
the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against
a debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable, if (i) it was entered into during the three months prior
to the filing of the petition of the commencement of the insolvency proceedings, the debtor
was illiquid at the time of such transaction and the counterparty to such transaction had
knowledge of the illiquidity at such time or (ii) it was entered into after such filing and the
counterparty to such transaction had knowledge of either the debtor’s illiquidity or such filing at
the time of the transaction;

    - any act by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (for example, whereby a debtor grants
security for a third-party debt), which might be regarded as having been granted gratuitously
(unentgeltlich), if it was effected in the four years prior to the filing of a petition for the
commencement of insolvency proceedings against the debtor;

     - any act performed by the debtor in the 10 years prior to the filing of the petition for the
commencement of insolvency proceedings with the intent (known to the beneficiary of the act at
the time of such act) to prejudice its creditors; if the relevant act consisted of a settlement of
an obligation or the grant of the security to the counterparty, the relevant period is four years
instead of 10 years; “knowledge by the beneficiary of the act” in terms of such provision is
presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was imminently illiquid (drohende
_Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors; if the relevant_
act granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction in a form or at a time


-----

to which or at which such creditor was entitled, the “knowledge by the beneficiary of the act” is
presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was actually illiquid (eingetretene
_Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors; the fact that_
the creditor agreed on a payment plan with the debtor or agreed to deferred payments establishes
a presumption that he had no knowledge of the debtor being illiquid at that time;

     - any contract entered into by the debtor in the last two years prior to the filing of the petition for
the opening of insolvency proceedings with a closely related party (which term includes in
particular the management, supervisory board members and shareholders of the debtor owning
more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, certain persons with comparable access to
information about the debtor, and certain of their or its affiliates, management and relatives)
and which is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors, unless the closely related party was
unaware of the debtor’s intent to prejudice its creditors;

     - any act that provides security or satisfaction for a shareholder loan made to the debtor or a
similar claim if (i) in the case of the provision of security, the act occurred during the 10 years
prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of the insolvency proceedings or after the
filing of such petition, or (ii) in the case of satisfaction, the act occurred during the last year
prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of the insolvency proceedings or after
the filing of such petition; and

     - any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent
claim to a third party if (i) the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a
petition for commencement of insolvency proceedings or thereafter and (ii) a shareholder of the
debtor had granted security or was liable as a guarantor (Bürge) (in which case the shareholder
has to compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)).

In this context, “knowledge” is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts
from which the conclusion must be drawn that the debtor was unable to pay its debts generally as they fell
due, that a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was detrimental
to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. A person is deemed to have
knowledge of the debtor’s intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors if it was aware of the debtor’s
actual illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or impending illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the
transaction prejudiced the debtor’s creditors, provided that, if the relevant act by the debtor consisted of a
settlement of an obligation or the grant of a security which was due to be paid or granted, as the case may be,
then the knowledge of the debtor’s intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors is only presumed if the
other party was aware of the actual illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) of the debtor and of the fact that the
transaction prejudiced the debtor’s creditors. With respect to a “related party,” there is a general statutory
presumption that such party had “knowledge.”

Furthermore, even in the absence of an insolvency proceeding, a third-party creditor who has
obtained an enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) but has failed to obtain satisfaction on its enforceable
claims by a levy of execution, under certain circumstances, has the right to avoid certain transactions, such as
the payment of debt and the granting of security pursuant to the German Code on Avoidance
(Anfechtungsgesetz). The conditions for avoidance under the German Code on Avoidance differ to a certain
extent from the above-described rules under the German Insolvency Code and the avoidance periods are
calculated from the date when a creditor exercises its rights of avoidance in the courts.

In addition, under German law, a creditor who provided additional, or extended existing, funding
to a debtor or obtained security from a debtor may be liable in tort if such creditor was aware of the
debtor’s (impending) insolvency or of circumstances indicating such debtor’s (impending) insolvency at the
time such funding was provided or extended or such security was granted. The German Federal Supreme
Court (Bundesgerichtshof) held that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor was to act with the
intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal
principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the
transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the debtor as the grantor of the guarantee or
security was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto.
Furthermore, according to a decision of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof), a security
or guarantee agreement may be void due to tortious inducement of breach of contract if a creditor knows
about the distressed financial situation of the debtor and anticipates that the debtor will only be able to grant
collateral by disregarding the vital interests of its other business partners. It cannot be ruled out that
German courts may apply this case law with respect to the granting of guarantees and/or security interests
to be granted by the German Guarantors.

**_Preventive Restructuring Framework_**

On June 20, 2019, the European Parliament and the Council adopted a new directive (Directive of
the European Parliament and the Council EU 2019/1023 on preventive restructuring frameworks, on
discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning
restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending directive (EU) 2017/1132 (the “Preventive
**Restructuring Directive”)). The Preventive Restructuring Directive sets out minimum standards to be applied**
by the member states (i.e., minimum harmonization). Although certain features of the EU Restructuring
Directive need to be transposed into national legislation, the EU Restructuring Directive leaves a large degree
of discretion regarding the implementation of certain other features.

In Germany, the Preventive Restructuring Directive was implemented by the law on the Further
Development of the German Restructuring and Insolvency Laws, which became effective on January 1,
2021. The core element of this law is a new Act on a Stabilisation and Restructuring Framework for
Enterprises (“Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act”)as well as changes to other laws, including to the
German Insolvency Code. The Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act provides for a framework
allowing the stabilisation and restructuring of companies outside and before an insolvency procedure, on
the basis of a restructuring plan prepared by the company in financial crisis.

Proceedings under the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act (“Restructuring Proceedings”)
are initiated through a notification by the respective debtor to affected creditors and/or the competent
restructuring court (Anzeige des Restrukturierungsvorhabens). Restructuring Proceedings are applicable in
cases in which a debtor faces imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit, i.e. that there is the imminent
risk for the debtor of being unable to pay any of its debt as and when it falls due during the course of
(regularly) the next 24 months. The debtor’s management is not obliged to file for such Restructuring
Proceedings. Therefore, the debtor may alternatively file for regular insolvency proceedings if the respective
requirements are met (see above under “—Insolvency”).

Unlike insolvency proceedings, Restructuring Proceedings do not necessarily cover all of a debtor’s
liabilities, as the debtor has a certain amount of flexibility under the Company Stabilisation and
Restructuring Act to adapt the scope of the proceedings to cover either all of his liabilities, only certain
types (e.g., financial liabilities, including under the Notes), or only selected liabilities. In addition and
depending on the extent to which a debtor requires to make use of certain legal tools available under the
Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act, the involvement of the competent restructuring court can be
kept to a minimum and proceedings can—under certain circumstances—even be conducted without the
need for any public notices despite being binding on affected creditors. Restructuring Proceedings may in
the case of a group of companies only be conducted for each entity separately. However, the Company
Stabilisation and Restructuring Act provides for a respective application of the provisions of the German
Insolvency Code which implemented the law to facilitate the mastering of group insolvencies (see above
under “—Insolvency”).

The core component of the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act is an out-of-court
restructuring of a debtor’s liabilities via a restructuring plan, including, e.g., by way of changes to the
principal amounts, interest rates and/or maturities of liabilities. Such restructuring plan may also negatively
impact (including, e.g., a release of) collateral granted for the benefit of the Notes by subsidiaries, parent
and sister companies of the debtor. A restructuring plan can generally be adopted and become binding for
creditors upon being approved by the required majority or majorities of a debtors’ creditors. Generally, the
relevant majority requirement is 75% of the respective principal amounts. However, if the restructuring
plan provides for multiple creditor groups (which the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act provides
for and allows under certain circumstances), such plan can even be adopted and become binding on a
creditors even if creditor class(es) have not approved the plan, provided certain requirements are met and a
restructuring provides its approval (cross-class cramdown).

In order for the debtor to be able to draw up and negotiate the restructuring plan, the Company
Stabilisation and Restructuring Act offers the possibility of having a moratorium ordered by the competent
court upon application by the debtor, which can restrict enforcement measures by certain or all creditors.
The moratorium can initially be ordered for a maximum period of up to three months, with subsequent
orders to extend the moratorium up to a maximum of eight months permissible under certain conditions.

For the holders of the Notes, among the relevant consequences of an initiation of Restructuring
Proceedings by a German Guarantor or any other Guarantor having its COMI in Germany would be the
following:


-----

    - potentially no or limited court review and/or supervision of a Restructuring Proceedings;

     - restrictions on individual enforcement actions for all or certain creditors of up to eight months
due to a moratorium;

     - any measures (such as reduction in principal and/or interest or deferrals) regulated by the
restructuring plan may be approved within a class of creditors with a majority of 75% of the
claims or by way of a so-called cross-class cram down;

     - any collateral granted by the debtor as well as intra-group collateral may be subject to
Restructuring Proceedings potentially leading to a negative impact on the respective collateral.

Restructuring plans which are public and confirmed by a German restructuring court will be
recognized in any EU member state pursuant to the EU Insolvency Proceedings Regulation (Regulation
(EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on insolvency proceedings).
However, this does not apply to plans in non-public restructuring matters under the Company Stabilisation
and Restructuring Act as they are not mentioned in Exhibit A of the EU Insolvency Proceedings Regulation.
Except for public restructuring matters, the recognition of the restructuring plan is subject to certain rules
and regulations under applicable international private law.

**Jersey**

**_Insolvency_**

There are two principal regimes for corporate insolvency in Jersey: désastre and winding-up
(including just and equitable winding up and creditors’ winding up). Under Jersey law, creditors and
debtors can apply for an Act of the Royal Court of Jersey under the Bankruptcy (Désastre) (Jersey) Law 1990,
as amended (the “Jersey Bankruptcy Law”) declaring the property of a debtor to be “en désastre” (a
“declaration”). On a declaration of désastre, title and possession of the property of the debtor vest
automatically in the Viscount, an official of the Royal Court (the “Viscount”). With effect from the date of
declaration, a creditor has no other remedy against the property or person of the debtor, and may not
commence or, except with the consent of the Viscount or Royal Court, continue any legal proceedings to
recover the debt. With effect from the date of declaration, a secured party may, however, without the consent
of the Viscount and without an order of the court, exercise any power of enforcement it may have under
Part 7 (Enforcement of Security Interests) of the Security Interests (Jersey) Law 2012 (the “2012 Security
**Law”). If the proceeds of such enforcement are insufficient to discharge liabilities owed, that secured party**
has no other remedy against the property or person of the debtor, and may not commence any legal
proceedings or, except with the consent of the Viscount or the Royal Court, continue any legal proceedings
to recover the balance of the debt.

Additionally, the creditors or shareholders of a Jersey company can commence a winding-up of an
insolvent company, which is known as a “creditors’ winding up” pursuant to Chapter 4 of Part 21 of the
Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, as amended (the “Jersey Companies Law”). On a creditors’ winding up
commenced by shareholders, a liquidator is nominated by the shareholders. The creditors may nominate a
different liquidator. If a different liquidator is nominated by creditors, a director, member or creditor can
apply to the court for an order that either the liquidator nominated by the company be liquidator instead of
or jointly with the liquidator nominated by the creditors or appointing a different liquidator. On a creditors’
winding up commenced by application to court by a creditor, the court may appoint a provisional liquidator
any time after such application. At the hearing of the application, if a winding up order is made, the court
may appoint a person nominated by the creditor or selected by the court to be liquidator. If a liquidator is
appointed by the court, any creditor of the company may within seven days of the creditors’ meeting
apply to court for someone else to be appointed liquidator instead of the liquidator appointed by the court.
The liquidator stands in the shoes of the directors and administers the winding up, gathers assets, makes
appropriate disposals of assets, settles claims and distributes assets as appropriate. After the appointment of
a provisional liquidator or the commencement of the winding up (whether commenced by shareholders or
court order), no action can be taken or proceeded with against the company except with the leave of court. In
a creditors’ winding up to be commenced by shareholders, the company must give creditors not less than
14 days’ notice of the shareholders meeting to commence the creditors’ winding up and give notice of a
creditors meeting to be held immediately after the shareholders meeting. Notice of the creditors’ meeting
must also be given in the Jersey Gazette no less than 10 days before the day for which the meeting has
been called. Except in exceptional circumstances, a creditor who applies to wind up the company must give
the company at least 48 hours’ notice that the application is being made. If the court orders a creditors’
winding up or appoints a provisional liquidator, the liquidator must, within seven days of the liquidator’s


-----

appointment, give the company’s creditors notice calling a creditors meeting to be held in Jersey 21 days
after the date of such court order (or if that day is not a business day, the next business day thereafter). After
the commencement of the creditors’ winding up, a secured party may, however, without the sanction of a
liquidator and without an order of the court, exercise any power of enforcement it may have under Part 7
(Enforcement of Security Interests) of the 2012 Security Law. If the proceeds of such enforcement are
insufficient to fully discharge the liabilities owed, that secured party cannot bring any action against the
company without the leave of the court. The corporate state and capacity of the company continues until
the end of the winding up procedure, when the company is dissolved. Under the Jersey Companies Law, a
creditor of a company (subject to appeal) is bound by an arrangement entered into by the company and its
creditors immediately before or in the course of its winding up if, among other things, three quarters in
number and value of the creditors acceded to such arrangement.

**_Transactions at an Undervalue_**

Under Article 17 of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 176 of the Jersey Companies Law, the
court may, on the application of the Jersey Viscount (in the case of a company whose property has been
declared “en désastre”) or liquidator (in the case of a creditors’ winding up), set aside a transaction (including
any guarantee or security interest) entered into by a company with any person (the “other party”) at an
undervalue. There is a five-year look-back period from the date of commencement of the winding up or
declaration of désastre during which transactions are susceptible to examination pursuant to this rule (the
“relevant time”). The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Jersey Companies Law contain detailed provisions,
including (without limitation) those that define what constitutes a transaction at an undervalue, the operation
of the relevant time and the effect of entering into such a transaction with a person connected with the
company or with an associate of the company.

**_Preference_**

Under Article 17A of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 176A of the Jersey Companies Law,
the court may, on the application of the Viscount (in the case of a company whose property has been
declared “en désastre”) or liquidator (in the case of a creditors’ winding up), set aside a preference (including
any guarantee or security interest) given by the company to any person (the “other party”). There is a
12-month look-back period from the date of commencement of the winding up or declaration of “désastre”
during which transactions are susceptible to examination pursuant to this rule (the “relevant time”). The
Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Jersey Companies Law contain detailed provisions, including (without limitation)
those that define what constitutes a preference, the operation of the relevant time and the effect of entering
into a preference with a person connected with the company or with an associate of the company.

**_Extortionate Credit Transactions_**

Under Article 17C of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 179 of the Jersey Companies Law,
the court may, on the application of the Viscount (in the case of a company whose property has been
declared “en désastre”) or liquidator (in the case of a creditors’ winding up), set aside a transaction providing
credit to the debtor company which is or was extortionate. There is a three-year look-back period from the
date of commencement of the winding up or declaration of “désastre” during which transactions are
susceptible to examination pursuant to this rule (the “relevant time”). The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and
Jersey Companies Law contain detailed provisions, including (without limitation) those that define what
constitutes a transaction which is extortionate.

**_Disclaimer of Onerous Property_**

Under Article 15 of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law, the Viscount may within six months following the
date of the declaration of désastre and under Article 171 of the Jersey Companies Law, a liquidator may
within six months following the commencement of a creditors’ winding up, disclaim any onerous property
of the company. “Onerous property” is defined to include any moveable property, a contract lease or other
immoveable property if it is situated outside of Jersey that is unsaleable or not readily saleable or is such
that it might give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act, and includes an
unprofitable contract.

A disclaimer operates to determine, as of the date it is made, the “rights, interests and liabilities of
the company in or in respect of the property disclaimed” but “does not, except so far as is necessary for the
purpose of releasing the company from liability, affect the rights or liabilities of any other person.” A
person sustaining loss or damage as a result of a disclaimer is deemed to be a creditor of the company to


-----

the extent of the loss or damage and shall have standing as a creditor in the désastre or creditors’ winding
up. The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Jersey Companies Law contain detailed provisions, including (without
limitation) in relation to the power to disclaim onerous property.

**_Fraudulent Dispositions_**

In addition to the Jersey statutory provisions referred to above, there are certain principles of
Jersey customary law (for example, a Pauline action) under which dispositions of assets with the intention
of defeating creditors’ claims may be set aside.

**_Fixed and Floating Charges_**

Under the laws of Jersey, a company incorporated in Jersey is deemed to have capacity to grant
security governed by foreign law over property situated outside the Island of Jersey, however:

     - to the extent that any fixed charge, floating charge or other security interest governed by nonJersey law (a “Foreign Law Security”) is expressed to apply as regards any Jersey situated intangible
moveable property, such Foreign Law Security should not be relied upon to create valid and
enforceable security in such Jersey situated intangible moveable property; and

     - to the extent that any Foreign Law Security is expressed to apply as regards Jersey situated
immovable property or Jersey situated tangible property, such Foreign Law Security would not
be valid and enforceable as regards such Jersey situated immovable property or Jersey situated
tangible property.

**_Administrators, Receivers and Statutory and Non-statutory Requests for Assistance_**

The Insolvency Act 1986 (either as originally enacted or as amended, including by the provisions
of the Enterprise Act 2002) does not apply in Jersey and receivers, administrative receivers and administrators
are not part of the laws of Jersey. Accordingly, the Courts of Jersey may not recognize the powers of an
administrator, administrative receiver or other receiver appointed in respect of Jersey situs assets.

However, under Article 49(1) of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law, the Jersey court may assist the courts of
prescribed countries and territories in all matters relating to the insolvency of any person to the extent that
the Jersey court thinks fit. These prescribed jurisdictions include the United Kingdom. Further, in doing
so, the Royal Court may have regard to the UNCITRAL model law, even though the model law has not been
(and is unlikely to be) implemented as a separate law in Jersey.

If the request comes from a non-prescribed country, then common law and principles of comity
will be considered by the Royal Court by virtue of its inherent jurisdiction. If insolvency proceedings are
afoot in another jurisdiction in relation to the company, the nature and extent of the cooperation from Jersey
is likely to depend on the nature of the requesting country’s insolvency regime. If the requesting country
adheres to principles of territoriality, as opposed to universality, and, for instance, ring-fences assets for local
creditors, full cooperation is highly unlikely. If, however, the jurisdiction applies similar fundamental
principles to those applied in Jersey, the Royal Court’s approach is more likely to be similar to the position
where prescribed countries are involved.

In the case of both statutory and non-statutory requests for assistance, it should not be assumed
that the UNCITRAL provisions will automatically be followed. That is a matter for the discretion of the
Royal Court. It would also be wrong to assume for European countries that the position will be in accordance
with Recast EU Insolvency Regulation. Jersey does not form part of the European Community for the
purposes of implementation of its directions. Accordingly, the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation does not
apply as a matter of Jersey domestic law and the automatic test of COMI does not apply as a result.

**_Enforcement of Jersey Security Interests under the 2012 Security Law_**

Security over assets situated in Jersey is created in accordance with the provisions of Jersey law.
The Notes will be secured by Jersey law security interests over all of the shares of INEOS Jersey Limited
held by IHL.

The 2012 Security Law provides that a secured party may enforce security over intangible movable
assets by way of sale or appropriation of the collateral or proceeds. In addition, a secured party may take
certain ancillary actions including any bespoke enforcement powers included in a security agreement to the


-----

extent not in conflict with the 2012 Security Law. More than one enforcement option can be taken, and
taking one or more of the enforcement options specified above does not preclude the exercise of a secured
party’s other rights.

The power of enforcement under the 2012 Security Law is exercisable once an event of default has
occurred and written notice specifying the event of default has been served on the grantor by the secured
party. If enforcement is by way of sale or appropriation, the secured party must give the grantor 14 days’ prior
written notice unless the grantor has agreed in writing to waive its right to notice. Said waivers are common
in the security agreement. The secured party is also obliged to give at least 14 days’ prior written notice to
(i) any person who has registered security interest in the collateral 21 days before the sale or appropriation,
and (ii) any person other than the grantor who has an interest in the collateral unless, in either case, the
secured party and such person have otherwise agreed in writing. There are other exceptions from the
obligation to give notice of sale.

On exercising the power of enforcement by appropriation or sale, the secured party must (i) take all
commercially reasonable steps to determine or, in the case of a sale, obtain the fair market value of the
collateral, as at the time of the relevant appropriation or sale; (ii) act in a commercially reasonable manner
in relation to the appropriation or sale; and (iii) also, in the case of a sale only, enter into any agreement for or
in relation to the sale only on commercially reasonable terms. The duty of the secured party is owed to the
grantor and also to any other person to whom the secured party was required to give notice of the
appropriation or sale.

If, in exercising its powers of enforcement under the 2012 Security Law, a secured party appropriates
or sells collateral, it must, within 14 days after the day on which the collateral is appropriated or sold, give
to the grantor, to any person with a registered subordinate security interest and to certain persons claiming
an interest in the collateral a written statement of account setting out certain information in relation to
that appropriation or sale.

If a secured party has sold or appropriated the collateral and the net value or proceeds of the
collateral exceeds the amount of the secured debt, the secured party must (subject to any senior security
interests) pay the amount of any resulting surplus in the following order: (i) in due order of priority, to any
person who has a registered subordinate security interest in the collateral (where the registration remained
effective immediately before the appropriation or sale); (ii) to any other person (other than the grantor) who
has given the secured party notice that that person claims an interest in the collateral and in respect of
which the secured party is satisfied that that person has a legally enforceable interest in the collateral; and
(iii) as to the balance (if any) to the grantor. Alternatively, the secured party may discharge its aforementioned
obligation with respect to any surplus by paying that amount into the Jersey courts, which may then only
be paid out based on an order of the court following an application by a person entitled to such surplus.

**Luxembourg**

**_Insolvency_**

The Luxembourg law of 7 August 2023 on business preservation and modernisation of insolvency
law and transposing Directive 2019/1023 on restructuring and insolvency proceedings (the “Insolvency
**Modernisation Law”), modernised the Luxembourg legal framework for insolvency and restructuring**
procedures. Under Luxembourg law, the following types of proceedings (altogether referred to as insolvency
proceedings) may be opened against an entity having its COMI in Luxembourg or an establishment within
the meaning of Recast EU Insolvency Regulation:

    - bankruptcy proceedings (faillite), the opening of which may be requested by the company or by
any of its creditors. Following such a request, the courts having jurisdiction may open bankruptcy
proceedings if the Luxembourg company: (i) is in a state of cessation of payments (cessation
_des paiements) and (ii) has lost its commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de crédit). If a court_
finds that these conditions are satisfied, it may also open bankruptcy proceedings, ex officio
(absent a request made by the company or a creditor). The main effect of such proceedings is the
suspension of all measures of enforcement against the company, except, subject to certain
limited exceptions, for enforcement by secured creditors and the payment of the secured creditors
in accordance with their rank upon realisation of the assets;

    - the out-of-court arrangement (accord amiable) which is a procedure where a debtor may propose
to its creditors (at least two of them) an arrangement with the purpose of reorganising all or
part of its assets or activities. This arrangement executed outside of legal proceedings then needs


-----

to be approved by a court. Once approved by the District Court (tribunal d’arrondissement), the
out-of-court arrangement (accord amiable) is enforceable and payments pursuant to it are
enforceable against the insolvency estate even if they fall within the suspect period; and

     - the judicial reorganisation (réorganisation judiciaire) which may be pursued for three different
objectives pursuant to three types of proceedings:

i. stay of proceedings (sursis) during a period of four months (which can be
extended to a maximum of up to 12 months) to enable an out-of-court arrangement
(accord amiable) to be reached with creditors. During the stay of proceedings
(sursis), (i) no individual enforcement action of outstanding creditors (créanciers
_sursitaires) is permitted, and (ii) the debtor may not be declared bankrupt (except at_
its own initiative) or be subject to judicial dissolution or be subject to
administrative dissolution without liquidation;

ii. restructuring plan by collective agreement/consent (réorganisation judiciaire par
_accord collectif), for a maximum period of 5 years and which may include a_
suspension of payment for a maximum period of 24 months, which is deemed to
have been approved by the creditors entitled to vote if it receives, in each category of
creditors, a favorable vote from a majority of the creditors within a category,
representing at least half of all sums due in that category. Such plan, if approved
by the court, is binding on all creditors. The provisions relating to the stay of
proceedings (sursis) will apply as from the filing for the judicial restructuring
procedure; or

iii. transfer by judicial decision (réorganisation judiciaire par transfert par décision de
_justice), whereby all or part of the company’s assets or business will be transferred_
to one or more third parties, which can be initiated either by the company or by
the state prosecutor. The provisions relating to the stay of proceedings (sursis) will
apply as from the filing for the judicial restructuring procedure.

From the submission of the judicial reorganization’s petition, no bankruptcy, judicial liquidation,
administrative dissolution without liquidation or enforcement measures, with exceptions, can be declared
or taken until the judgment of the district court ruling on the debtor’s request.

Financial collateral arrangements, set off and netting arrangements falling within the scope of the
law of 5 August 2005 on financial collateral arrangements remain enforceable and unaffected by a judicial
reorganization procedure or by the stay of proceedings (sursis).

Controlled management (gestion contrôlée) within the meaning of the Grand Ducal regulation of
24 May 1935 and composition with creditors (concordat préventif de faillite) within the meaning of the law
of 14 April 1886, were abolished by the Insolvency Modernisation Law and no longer apply.

In addition, your ability to receive payment on the relevant Notes may be affected by a decision of
a court to act a stay on payments (sursis de paiement) or to put the relevant Luxembourg company into
judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire). Judicial liquidation proceedings may be opened at the request of
the public prosecutor against companies pursuing an activity violating criminal laws or that are in serious
breach or violation of the commercial code or of the laws governing commercial companies. The management
of such liquidation proceedings will generally follow the rules of bankruptcy proceedings.

**_Preferential debts_**

Liability of a Luxembourg Guarantor in respect of the Notes will, in the event of a liquidation of
the entity following bankruptcy or judicial liquidation proceedings, only rank after the cost of liquidation
(including any debt incurred for the purpose of such liquidation) and those debts of the relevant entity that
are entitled to priority under Luxembourg law. Preferential debts under Luxembourg law include, among
others:

    - certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg Revenue;

    - value-added tax and other taxes and duties owed to the Luxembourg Customs and Excise;

     - social security contributions; and

    - remuneration owed to employees.


-----

For the avoidance of doubt, the above list is not exhaustive. Assets in the form of shares, accounts
or receivables over which a security interest has been granted and perfected will in principle not be available
for distribution to unsecured creditors (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is realized),
and subject to application of the relevant priority rule and liens and privileges arising mandatorily by law.
In particular, pursuant to article 20 of the Luxembourg Act dated August 5, 2005 concerning financial
collateral arrangements (the “Luxembourg Collateral Law”), all collateral arrangements, in respect of
assets over which the Luxembourg security interests have been granted, as well as all enforcement events
and valuation and enforcement measures agreed upon by the parties in accordance with this law, are valid
and enforceable against unsecured creditors, third parties, commissioners, receivers, liquidators and other
similar persons notwithstanding any insolvency proceedings.

**_General limitations on enforcement resulting from insolvency proceedings_**

During such insolvency proceedings, all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors are
suspended. The ability of certain secured creditors to enforce their security interest may also be limited.

Luxembourg insolvency laws may also affect transactions entered into or payments made by the
relevant Luxembourg company during the period before bankruptcy, the so-called “suspect period”
(periode suspecte), which is a maximum of six months, as from the date on which the Commercial Court
formally adjudicates a person bankrupt, and, as for specific payments and transactions, during an additional
period of 10 days before the commencement of such period preceding the judgment declaring bankruptcy,
except that in certain specific situations the court may set the start of the suspect period at an earlier date, if
the bankruptcy judgment was preceded by another insolvency proceedings under Luxembourg law. In
particular:

    - pursuant to article 445 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce (code de commerce), specified
transactions (such as, in particular, the granting of a security interest for antecedent debts; the
payment of debts which have not fallen due, whether payment is made in cash or by way of
assignment, sale, set-off or by any other means; the payment of debts which have fallen due by any
means other than in cash or by bill of exchange; the sale of assets without consideration or
with substantially inadequate consideration) entered into during the suspect period (or the 10 days
preceding it) must be set aside or declared null and void, if so requested by the insolvency
receiver;

    - pursuant to article 21 (2) of the Luxembourg Collateral Law, notwithstanding the suspect period
as referred to in articles 445 and 446 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, where a financial
collateral arrangement has been entered into on the day of the commencement of domestic or
foreign winding-up proceedings or reorganization measures or similar proceedings, but after
the Court decision ruling regarding the opening of such proceedings or after such measure
becomes effective, such arrangement is valid and binding against third parties, administrators,
insolvency receivers, liquidators and other similar organs if the collateral taker proves that it was
unaware of the fact that such proceedings had been opened or that such measures had been
taken or that it could not reasonably be aware of it;

    - pursuant to article 446 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, payments made for matured
debts as well as other transactions concluded for consideration during the suspect period are
subject to cancellation by the court upon proceedings instituted by the insolvency receiver if they
were concluded with the knowledge of the bankrupt party’s cessation of payments; and

    - in the case of bankruptcy, article 448 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce and article 1167
of the Civil Code (action paulienne) gives the insolvency receiver (acting on behalf of the creditors)
the right to challenge any fraudulent payments and transactions, including the granting of
security with an intent to defraud, made prior to the bankruptcy, without any time limit.

In principle, a bankruptcy order rendered by a Luxembourg court does not result in automatic
termination of contracts except for intuitu personae contracts, that is, contracts for which the identity of the
company or its solvency were crucial. The contracts, therefore, subsist after the bankruptcy order. However,
the insolvency receiver may choose to terminate certain contracts. As of the date of adjudication of
bankruptcy, no interest on any unsecured claim will accrue vis-à-vis the bankruptcy estate.

Insolvency proceedings may hence have a material adverse effect on the relevant Luxembourg
company’s business and assets and the Luxembourg company’s respective obligations under the Notes (as
Luxembourg Guarantor).


-----

Finally, international aspects of Luxembourg bankruptcy may be subject to Recast EU Insolvency
Regulation.

**_Enforceability of financial collateral arrangements_**

According to the Luxembourg Collateral Law, with the exception of the provisions of the law of
8 January 2013 on the over-extension of debt, the provisions of Book III, Title XVII of the Luxembourg
Civil Code, of Book I, Title VIII and of Book III of the Luxembourg Commercial Code and national or
foreign provisions governing reorganization measures, winding-up proceedings or other similar proceedings
and attachments are not applicable to financial collateral arrangements and netting agreements and shall
not constitute an obstacle to the enforcement and to the performance by the parties of their obligations.

Pursuant to article 20 of the Luxembourg Collateral Law, Luxembourg law governed financial
collateral arrangements, as well as the enforcement events, netting agreements and the valuation and
enforcement measures agreed upon by the parties in accordance with this law, remain valid and enforceable
even if entered into during the hardening period against third parties, commissioners, receivers, liquidators
and other similar persons notwithstanding reorganization measures, winding up proceedings or any other
similar national or foreign proceedings (save in the case of fraud).

In accordance with article 24 of the Luxembourg Collateral Law, the rules of Luxembourg
insolvency proceedings are inapplicable where the collateral provider of financial collateral arrangement or
similar security interest governed by a foreign law other than Luxembourg law, is established or resides in
Luxembourg.

**_Limitations on Enforcement of guarantees_**

There is no published Luxembourg case law and only limited Luxembourg legal literature in
connection with enforcement of guarantees granted by a Luxembourg guarantor for a company of the
group (whether downstream, cross-stream or upstream guarantees).

It is generally admitted that the grant of a guarantee by a Luxembourg company for the obligations
of another group company shall be subject to the following conditions: (i) it must be within the corporate
purpose of the guarantor as set out in its articles of association; (ii) it shall correspond to a demonstrable and
commensurate corporate benefit received by the guarantor company; and (iii) the financial obligations
assumed by the guarantor must not be disproportionate to the financial capacity of the guarantor.

The question of corporate benefit is determined on a case-by-case basis.

For the purpose of condition (iii) above, it is standard market practice that cross-stream and
upstream guarantees granted by Luxembourg guarantors must be limited in their amount (as is the case
pursuant to the Indenture), as opposed to downstream guarantees.

According to the limited Luxembourg doctrine on this matter, in the event the above conditions
are not met, the directors of the company may be held liable and it is only in exceptional cases in which it is
demonstrated that (i) the beneficiary was aware of the ultra vires nature of the guarantee or (ii) that the
guarantee was given with the intent to defraud creditors of the guarantor or (iii) the guarantee qualifies as
a misuse of corporate asset (abus de bien social) that a court may void the guarantee itself.

In accordance with the principle fraus omnia corrumpit, a first demand guarantee would not be
enforceable under Luxembourg law if it is called upon in a manifestly abusive way by the beneficiary of the
guarantee.

**_Security Interests Considerations_**

The Notes are secured, among other things, by several security interests governed by Luxembourg
law. According to Luxembourg conflict of law rules, the courts in Luxembourg will generally apply the lex
_rei sitae or lex situs (the law of the place where the assets or subject matter of the pledge or security interest is_
situated) in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over such assets. As a
consequence, Luxembourg law will apply in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security
interests over assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, such as registered shares in
Luxembourg companies, bank accounts held with a Luxembourg bank, receivables or claims governed by
Luxembourg law or having debtors located in Luxembourg, tangible assets located in Luxembourg, securities
which are held through an account located in Luxembourg, bearer securities physically located in
Luxembourg, etc.


-----

If there are assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, the security interests over such
assets will be governed by Luxembourg law and must be created, perfected and enforced in accordance with
Luxembourg law. The Luxembourg Collateral Law governs the creation, validity, perfection and
enforcement of pledges over shares, bank account and receivables located in Luxembourg. Under the
Luxembourg Collateral Law, the perfection of security interests depends on certain registration, notification
and acceptance requirements.

Article 11 of the Luxembourg Collateral Law sets forth the following enforcement remedies
available upon the occurrence of an enforcement event:

     - the direct appropriation, or appropriation by third parties, of the pledged assets at (i) a value
determined in accordance with a valuation method agreed upon by the parties or (ii) the market
price, where the pledged financial instruments are admitted to trading on a trading venue;

     - a sale of the pledged assets (i) in a private transaction on commercially reasonable terms
(conditions commerciales normales), (ii) on a trading venue on which they are admitted to trading
or (iii) by way of a public auction;

     - a court allocation of the pledged assets to the pledgee in discharge of the secured obligations
following a valuation made by a court-appointed expert; or

     - set-off between the secured obligations and the pledged assets.

As the Luxembourg Collateral Law does not provide any specific time periods and depending on
(i) the method chosen, (ii) the valuation of the pledged assets, (iii) any possible recourse and (iv) the
possible need to involve third parties, such as, e.g., courts, stock exchanges and appraisers, the enforcement
of the security interests might be substantially delayed.

Foreign law governed security interests and the powers of any receivers or administrators may not
be enforceable in respect of assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Security interests or
arrangements, which are not expressly recognized under Luxembourg law and the powers of any receivers
or administrators might not be recognized or enforced by the Luxembourg courts, in particular where the
Luxembourg security grantor becomes subject to Luxembourg insolvency proceedings or where the
Luxembourg courts otherwise have jurisdiction because of the actual or deemed location of the relevant
rights or assets, except if “main insolvency proceedings” (as defined in the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation)
are opened under Luxembourg law and such security interest or arrangements constitute rights in rem
over assets located in another Member State in which the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation applies.

The perfection of the security interests created pursuant to the pledge agreements does not
prevent any third party creditor from seeking attachment or execution against the assets, which are subject
to the security interests created under the pledge agreements, to satisfy their unpaid claims against the pledgor.
Such creditor may seek the forced sale of the assets of the pledgors through court proceedings, although
the beneficiaries of the pledges will in principle remain entitled to priority over the proceeds of such sale
(subject to preferred rights by operation of law).

Under the Luxembourg Collateral Law, the enforcement of a pledge is permitted in case of an
event of default as agreed between the parties, including an event of default which would not be a default
of payment when due (e.g., breach of covenants or representations and warranties).

**_Certain Preferences_**

Under Luxembourg law, certain creditors of an insolvent party have rights to preferred payments
arising by operation of law, some of which may, under certain circumstances, supersede the rights to
payment of secured or unsecured creditors, and most of which are undisclosed preferences (privilèges
_occultes). This includes in particular the rights relating to fees and costs of the insolvency official as well as_
any legal costs, the rights of employees to certain amounts of salary, and the rights of the Treasury and
certain assimilated parties (namely social security bodies), which preferences may extend to all or part of the
assets of the insolvent party. This general privilege takes in principle precedence over the privilege of a
pledgee in respect of pledged assets.

**_Translation of Documents_**

The Luxembourg courts, or the official Luxembourg authority, may require that the Notes, the
Security Documents, the Indenture (and any other document in connection therewith), and any judgment
obtained in a foreign court, be translated into French or German.

**_Limitations on the validity and enforceability of guarantees and securities provided by Guarantors incorporated_**
**_in Norway_**

The legal capacity or ability for a Guarantor incorporated in Norway (a “Norwegian Guarantor”)
to provide financial assistance, including granting loans and providing security or guarantees, may be
limited by applicable law, including, but not limited to the mandatory provisions of Section 8-7 and 8-10 of
the Norwegian Private Limited Companies Act of June 13, 1997 No. 44 (the “Norwegian Companies
Act”).

Section 8-7 of the Norwegian Companies Act restricts a Norwegian private limited liability
company from granting credit to, guaranteeing or providing security for the obligations of, its shareholders
(or any related party) beyond its distributable reserves (free equity) and then, further provided that
satisfactory security for repayment/recovery has been established in favor of the relevant company.

The above restriction does not, however, apply to credit or security/guarantee for the obligations
of a Norwegian incorporated parent company or another Norwegian incorporated group company. This
exemption must be read in conjunction with the group definition in Section 1-3 of the Norwegian Companies
Act. A Norwegian limited liability company may also grant credit or provide security and guarantees for
the obligations of a foreign company who has decisive influence over the Norwegian company or subsidiaries
of such company, provided that such credit, security or guarantee serves the economic interest of the
group of companies (i.e., for instance, that the purpose of the transaction is not to benefit the beneficial
owners of the group, for example by financing distributions to the owners).

In addition to the restrictions with regard to, among others, upstream and cross-stream guarantees
and security as outlined above, Section 8-10 of the Norwegian Companies Act restricts the ability of a
Norwegian private limited liability company to provide financial assistance (including to put funds at
disposal, grant loans or provide security or guarantees) in connection with the acquisition of its shares or
shares in the parent company (and any intermediate parent company). The restrictions concerning financial
assistance apply irrespective of whether the company whose shares are acquired is a Norwegian or a
foreign company. In order for a guarantee, loan or security provided by a Norwegian Guarantor in favour
of a purchaser of shares in such Norwegian Guarantor or its parent company to be valid and binding, the
financial exposure of such Norwegian Guarantor must not exceed the amounts that the Norwegian
Guarantor has available for distribution of dividends to its shareholders, and furthermore the financial
assistance must be granted on ordinary, commercial terms. The limitation of financial assistance to amounts
that a Norwegian Guarantor has available for distribution of dividends does not apply if the acquirer of
the shares is based in the European Economic Area and the acquirer is, or will following the acquisition, form
part of the same group of companies as the Norwegian Guarantor providing financial assistance. Moreover,
Section 8-10 of the Norwegian Companies Act requires the board of directors of the company providing
financial assistance to (i) ensure that the credit worthiness of the purchaser is evaluated and (ii) grant a
declaration to the effect that it will be in the interest of the company to grant the financial assistance and that
the company will have sufficient equity and liquidity for doing so and also give an account for the
background and terms of such financial assistance. The financial assistance must thereafter be approved by
at least two-thirds of both the votes cast and the share capital represented at the general meeting of the
Norwegian Guarantor, and furthermore, the financial assistance cannot be provided before completion of
a special procedure where the information is filed with the Norwegian Register of Business Enterprises (No.:
_Foretaksregisteret). The restrictions apply not only to the granting of loans, guarantees and securities, but_
also to asset distributions and other transfers which are not deemed lawful distributions under the Norwegian
Companies Act. The financial assistance is restricted if made “in connection with” an acquisition of
shares, which may also cover financial assistance after completion of such acquisition, for instance, by way
of a refinancing of acquisition debt.

A loan, guarantee or security interest infringing the limitations set out in Section 8-7 and
Section 8-10 of the Norwegian Companies Act is void and any funds paid out pursuant to such guarantee
or security interest will have to be repaid. In addition, loans, securities and guarantees of Guarantors
incorporated in Norway may be deemed void for failing to comply with the provisions in Chapter 3 of the
Norwegian Companies Act regulating transactions between the company and its shareholders and
transactions within the “group.”

The principle of corporate benefit also exists in Norway and may in some situations impose a
restriction on a Norwegian company’s ability to offer credits or a guarantee and provide security to


-----

shareholders (or close associates of the shareholders) in addition to the restrictions on financial assistance
and upstream/cross-stream guarantees, loans and security described above.

The liability of each Guarantor incorporated in Norway for the Issuer’s and the other Guarantors’
obligations under the Notes will be limited to €7,850,000,000 with the addition of interest, default interest,
fees, costs, enforcement costs and expenses under the Notes (or its equivalent in other currencies).

The above limitations shall apply mutatis mutandis to any security created by a Guarantor
incorporated in Norway under the Collateral and to any guarantee, indemnity and similar obligations
resulting in a payment obligation and payment pursuant to the Collateral made by a Guarantor incorporated
in Norway.

**_Foreclosure of Security Interest_**

Enforcement of security granted pursuant to the Norwegian Financial Collateral Act of March 26,
2004 No. 17, implementing the EU Financial Collateral Directive (Directive 2002/47/EC, as amended),
must be implemented on commercially reasonable terms pursuant to the mandatory provisions of the
Norwegian Financial Collateral Act. Enforcement of other Norwegian law security in Norway will be subject
to the mandatory provisions of the Norwegian Enforcement Act of June 26, 1992 No. 86.

Under the Norwegian Companies Act, Section 5-2, a shareholder may at any time revoke a power
of attorney to exercise voting rights. Accordingly, provisions in a Norwegian law governed share pledge
giving the holder of the security power of attorney to vote for the relevant shares may therefore be rendered
ineffective against the relevant company whose shares are pledged in the event the pledgor of the relevant
shares were to revoke the power of attorney while he remains the registered owner of the shares.

A pledge in future shares is only to be read as an obligation to pledge future shares, and is not a legal
and valid pledge in itself. Consequently, a share declaration by the pledgor must be issued and notified to
the issuer of the shares, upon issuance of the shares, in order to obtain a perfected security interest in such
future shares.

Only creditors of a claim may have active judicial standing in a Norwegian court; therefore, a
security agent may seek enforcement of a claim but such claim may have to be supported by the actual
creditors of such claim. A security agent has standing to be sued in Norway and it is believed that a security
agent may enforce any security being subject to the Norwegian Financial Collateral Act of March 26,
2004 No. 17.

**_Insolvency_**

Norwegian insolvency legislation is regulated by the Norwegian Bankruptcy Act of June 8, 1984
No. 58 (the “Bankruptcy Act”), which sets out the various procedures to be followed both in case of court
administered debt negotiations and bankruptcy proceedings, and the Norwegian Creditors Recovery Act of
June 8, 1984 No. 59 (the “Recovery Act”) containing provisions on, among other things, the priority of
claims.

As a response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Norwegian Parliament passed the temporary
Norwegian Reconstruction Act of May 7, 2020 No. 38 (the “Temporary Reconstruction Act”) on April 28,
2020. The Temporary Reconstruction Act introduced a new debt reorganization regime to temporarily replace
the abovementioned rules on court administered debt negotiations proceedings in the Bankruptcy Act.
Originally set to expire on January 1, 2022, the Temporary Reconstruction Act has been extended on
numerous occasions, and is currently, following an extension approved by the Norwegian Parliament on
May 11, 2023, scheduled to be repealed on July 1, 2025.

On January 13, 2023, a proposal for a permanent act on reorganization, based on principles largely
similar to those set out in the Temporary Reorganization Act, was sent on public hearing.

The key features of the Norwegian bankruptcy proceedings are (i) the seizure and subsequent
disposal of the debtor’s assets, (ii) the assessment and ranking of claims, (iii) the testing and revocation of
transactions (including security over existing claims) made prior to the bankruptcy proceedings being
initiated, (iv) the handling of the debtor’s contractual relationships and (v) the distribution of funds (if any)
in accordance with the priority rules. If the business operations of the bankrupt company are continued,
they are in practice continued at the risk of, and only to the extent guaranteed by, the creditors.


-----

**_Bankruptcy Proceedings_**

Bankruptcy proceedings may be opened if the debtor is insolvent. Both the debtor and the
creditors who have a right to a bankruptcy dividend can petition for bankruptcy.

There are two requirements for a debtor to be deemed to be insolvent. The debtor must (i) be
unable to service its debt as it becomes due (the “cash flow test”), and (ii) be in asset “deficit” (i.e., the
company’s liabilities must exceed the sum of its assets and revenues) (the “balance sheet test”).

During bankruptcy proceedings the debtor’s assets are controlled by the court appointed liquidator
(generally a lawyer), on behalf of the bankruptcy estate. The main task of the liquidator is to turn all the
debtor’s assets into cash in the manner assumed to be most profitable for the bankruptcy estate (the creditors),
and then to distribute the available cash to the rightful creditors.

All the debtor’s assets will in practice be seized by the bankruptcy estate, and the debtor may not
dispose of the seized assets in any way while the bankruptcy proceedings are ongoing. The bankruptcy
estate may also seize assets held by third parties if (A) these assets are acquired from the debtor in an unlawful
manner,(B) the acquisition lacks legal protection, (C) the transaction can be reversed according to the
provisions of the Recovery Act, or (D) these assets are transfered from the debtor to a third party through
a pro forma arrangement. The bankruptcy estate is a separate legal entity, which is authorized to exercise all
ownership interests/rights with respect to the seized assets, including but not limited to the realisation of
assets.

Secured creditors are, in principle, not deemed to be part of the bankruptcy proceedings to the
extent the value of the security is sufficient to cover the underlying obligations of the debtor. The secured
creditors may, in principle, realize the security and cover their claims, however, keeping in mind that the
realisation of a number of categories of security the first six months after the opening of a bankruptcy will be
subject to the approval of the bankruptcy estate (the same principles apply to official debt negotiations).
The bankruptcy estate may, subject to certain conditions being fulfilled, also decide to realize the security and
divide the proceeds between the secured creditors and others holding legal rights in the assets.

Any undersecured amount (any amount exceeding the value of the secured assets) will be deemed
as an ordinary (unsecured) trade claim.

In a Norwegian bankruptcy, claims against the estate are covered in the following order of
priority:

     - Secured claims (valid and perfected security covered up to the value of the secured asset—either
after the realisation by the secured creditor itself or after realisation undertaken by the
bankruptcy estate).

         - Super priority claims (claims which arise during the bankruptcy proceedings, liquidator’s
costs, obligations of the bankruptcy estate).

         - Salary claims (within certain limitations).

         - Tax claims (such as withholding tax and value-added tax within certain limitations).

         - Ordinary unsecured claims (all other claims unless subordinated, including unsecured
debt, trade creditors and indemnity claims).

         - Subordinated claims (including interest incurred after the opening of bankruptcy
proceedings, claims subordinated by agreement, liquidated damages and penalty claims).

         - Creditors will obtain recovery from the surplus remaining after claims with better
priority have received full recovery (the “waterfall principle”).

Pursuant to the Recovery Act, the bankruptcy estate may be entitled to set aside or reverse certain
transactions carried out in the three- up to 12-month period (and in respect of transactions in favor of
related parties up to two years) before the opening of the bankruptcy, such as extraordinary payments of
certain creditors, security established for existing debt and transaction at under-value. The bankruptcy estate
may also, under certain circumstances, be entitled to set aside or reverse transactions made in bad faith or
negligently which in an improper manner increase the debtor’s debt, favor one creditor at the expense of
others or deprive the debtor of assets which may otherwise have served to cover the creditors’ claims, in
which case the time limit for challenges by the estate is increased to 10 years.


-----

It should also be noted that the bankruptcy estate has a statutory first lien of up to 5% of the
respective asset’s estimated value or sales value over assets which have been mortgaged/pledged by the
debtor or mortgaged/pledged by a third party for the debtor’s indebtedness. The purpose of such statutory
lien is to secure necessary costs related to the bankruptcy proceedings. However, the statutory lien is limited to
the Norwegian Court Fee (presently being in the amount of 1,277 Norwegian kroner) multiplied by 700
for assets registered in an asset register (“realregister”)). Such statutory lien is not applicable to security
granted pursuant to the Norwegian Financial Collateral Act of March 26, 2004 No.17, implementing the EU
Financial Collateral Directive, cf. the Norwegian Liens Act of February 8, 1980 No. 2 Section 6-4 (9).

**_Debt Reorganization Proceedings_**

Pursuant to the Temporary Reconstruction Act, debtors that are facing, or in the near future will
face, serious economic problems (without necessarily being insolvent) may petition to the court for the
commencement of debt reorganization proceedings. Moreover, any of the company’s creditor may request
debt reorganization proceedings if the debtor is unable to meet its obligations as they fall due.

The goal of such proceedings is to enable the debtor to restructure its debts, following either
unanimous creditor consent (“Unanimous Reorganization”) or consent from a requisite majority of the
creditors affected (a “Non-Unanimous Reorganization”). The commencement of debt reorganization
proceedings results in the appointment of a reorganization officer and a creditor committee that together
form a reorganization committee. The reorganization committee is charged with supervising the debtor
during the proceedings and assisting it with putting forward reorganization proposal to its creditors.

Subject to certain exceptions, the enforcement rights of creditors are suspended during debt
reorganization proceedings.

During the course of debt reorganization proceedings, the debtor may, subject to the consent of
the reorganization committee, incur new debt to finance its operations during reconstruction and in
relation thereto grant security over its assets that rank ahead of existing security interests (so called
“superpriority”). Such superpriority security interests may be created over the debtor’s machinery and
plant, inventory and trade receivables in favor of lenders who agree to finance the continuation of the debtor’s
business activities and associated expenses during the debt reorganization proceedings. There is no limit to
the amounts of debt that may be secured on a superpriority basis, but existing secured creditors may petition
for the reversal of the reorganization committee’s consent if the superpriority security interest has a
material adverse effect on their position. In addition to having superpriority security over certain assets, any
person providing financing of debt reorganization proceedings under the Temporary Reconstruction Act
has a statutory first priority lien of up to 5% of the estimated value (or realized value, if different) of any of
the debtor’s assets which have been pledged as security for the debtor’s liabilities, limited to 700 times the
applicable Norwegian court fee for each registered asset.

Assets (including receivables) acquired by a debtor while under debt reorganization proceedings
will as a starting point fall outside the scope of existing security interests.

A Unanimous Reorganization may in principle consist of any amendments to the debtor’s debts.
The adoption of a reorganization proposal as Unanimous Reorganization generally requires the consent of
all creditors concerned. However, in the event that no creditors have rejected the proposal following the
expiry of a voting period set by the reorganization officer, the proposal will be deemed approved if it has
been approved by creditors representing three-fourths of the claims affected.

A Non-Unanimous Reorganization may consist of any of the following measures:

    - a rescheduling of the debtor’s payment obligations;

     - a reduction of the debtor’s debts;

     - the conversion of debt to equity capital;

     - the transfer of all or parts of the debtor’s business and assets to a purchaser;

     - the transfer and winding up of all the debtor’s business and assets with the debtor being released
from debts exceeding the proceeds of the winding up; and/or

    - a combination of the above measures.

A Non-Unanimous Reorganization cannot encroach upon the rights of non-consenting secured
creditors, creditors that enjoy preferential priority in bankruptcy (except for certain tax claims) and


-----

creditors with set-off rights. However, secured claims may be encroached upon if and to the extent the
reorganization committee deems that the claim exceeds the value of the secured assets.

The adoption of a Non-Unanimous Reorganization requires the approval of creditors representing
a majority of the claims with voting rights, calculated by amount. The claims with voting rights will generally
be the claims that are affected by the proposal.

Following the approval of a requisite majority, a Non-Unanimous Reorganization must be
sanctioned by the court. The court may, in addition to reviewing whether procedural requirements have
been observed, review the fairness of the proposal. Such review will take into account whether individual
creditors have been compensated to consent to the reorganization, the burden-sharing among the creditors
and whether creditors are worse off than if the debtor was instead subject to bankruptcy proceedings.

**Scotland**

**_The United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union_**

While the United Kingdom was a member state of the EU, jurisdiction to open insolvency
proceedings and insolvency processes opened in the United Kingdom were subject to both EU and
applicable UK domestic legislation. Following the United Kingdom’s departure from the EU on January 31,
2020, and the expiry of the subsequent Transition Period on December 31, 2020, in accordance with the
EUWA, EU law as directly applicable in the United Kingdom at the end of the Transition Period (subject
to certain exceptions) was transposed into UK domestic law subject to significant amendments. The
Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/146) (as amended) effected key amendments
to both EU insolvency laws previously directly applicable in the United Kingdom, including the Recast
EU Insolvency Regulation, and domestic insolvency laws. Additional regulations were implemented in
Scotland (The Insolvency (EU Exit) (Scotland) (Amendment) Regulations (SI 2019/94)) to effect necessary
amendments to Scottish specific legislation.

**_Insolvency_**

Some of the security interests are being granted under the laws of Scotland by non-Scottish
entities (each, a “Scottish Security Grantor”). Any insolvency proceedings by or against a Scottish Security
Grantor may be based on Scottish insolvency laws if the relevant jurisdiction can be established, however
the country of incorporation of the relevant non-Scottish entity or its COMI may affect which country’s
insolvency laws apply.

Although the scope of the Scottish courts’ jurisdiction varies for the different insolvency proceedings
available in Scotland, Scottish courts generally have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in respect
of any company which is incorporated in Scotland, any company which has its COMI in the United Kingdom
or any company which has its COMI in an EU Member State (other than Denmark). In certain cases it
may also be necessary for foreign incorporated entities to meet a number of other threshold requirements
such as demonstrating a sufficient connection with the Scottish jurisdiction. While this allows Scottish courts
to assume jurisdiction over certain foreign companies in respect of certain insolvency proceedings, the
efficacy of such proceedings may significantly depend on the likelihood and extent of subsequent recognition
of such proceedings in relevant other jurisdictions.

To the extent that a Scottish Security Grantor has its COMI in an EU Member State, insolvency
proceedings could, pursuant to the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation and subject to certain exceptions, be
opened in the relevant EU Member State and be subject to the laws of that EU Member State.

**_Receivership_**

Pursuant to Section 51(1) of the Insolvency Act 1986, it is competent, subject to the comments
below regarding administrative receivership, for a holder of a floating charge to appoint a receiver over the
property which is subject to the floating charge, provided that either the Court of Session has jurisdiction to
wind up the grantor of the floating charge, or, where the Court of Session does not have jurisdiction to
wind up the grantor of the floating charge, a court of an EU Member State has jurisdiction to open
insolvency proceedings under the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation as that Regulation has effect in the
European Union.

In terms of the Insolvency Act 1986, the Court of Session has jurisdiction to wind up any company
registered in Scotland. The Insolvency Act 1986 also confers a broad discretion to order the winding up of
an unregistered company (which includes any association or company, with the exception of a company


-----

registered under the Companies Act 2006 in any part of the United Kingdom). Such discretion may be
exercised in relation to a Scottish Security Grantor if the following three core requirements are met: (i) the
Scottish Security Grantor has a sufficient connection with Scotland; (ii) there is a reasonable possibility of
benefit to the party or parties applying for the winding up of the Scottish Security Grantor; and (iii) one
or more persons interested in the distribution of the Scottish Security Grantor’s assets is a person over whom
the court can exercise jurisdiction.

Whether a court of an EU Member State has jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings will
depend on the location of the company’s COMI and whether this is found to be in the relevant EU
Member State or in another EU Member State provided that the company has an establishment in the
relevant EU Member State. There are a number of factors that are taken into account to ascertain the COMI.
The COMI should correspond to the place where the company conducts the administration of its interests
on a regular basis and is therefore ascertainable by third parties. The place of the registered office of the
company is presumed to be the COMI in the absence of proof to the contrary, provided that the registered
office has not been moved to another EU Member State within the 3-month period prior to the request for the
opening of insolvency proceedings. The point at which this issue falls to be determined is the time when
the application to open insolvency proceedings is filed.

**_Fixed and Floating Charges_**

There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has an advantage over floating charge
security: (a) provided that the floating charge is not created or does not otherwise arise under a security
financial collateral arrangement, an administrator appointed to a charging company can convert floating
charge assets to cash and use such cash, or use cash subject to a floating charge, to meet administration
expenses (which can include the administrator’s remuneration and the costs of continuing to operate the
charging company’s business) while in administration in priority to the claims of the floating charge
holder; (b) a fixed charge, even if created after the date of a floating charge, may have priority as against
the floating charge over the same charged assets (provided the fixed charge holder has no notice of any
restrictions); (c) provided that the floating charge is not created or does not otherwise arise under a security
financial collateral arrangement, costs and expenses (including the liquidator’s remuneration) properly
incurred in a winding up are payable out of the company’s assets (including the assets that are the subject
of the floating charge) in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder either where agreed or where the
costs and expenses are related to the realisation of the floating charge assets; (d) until the floating charge
security crystallizes (which does not occur automatically on the appointment of an administrator in Scotland),
a company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating charge security in the ordinary course
of business, meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the charging company so as to give a
third party good title to the assets free of the floating charge; (e) there are particular challenge risks in
relation to floating charge security (see “—Grant of Floating Charge”); (f) where the floating charge is not
created or does not otherwise arise under a security financial collateral arrangement, floating charge security
is subject to the claims of certain preferential creditors (such as certain unpaid pension contributions,
salaries owed to employees (subject to a cap per employee), holiday pay owed to employees and VAT and
certain other tax debts due to HMRC) and to ring-fencing for unsecured creditors (see “—Administration
and Floating Charges”); and (g) an administrator may dispose of or take action relating to property subject
to a floating charge without the prior consent of the charge holder or court approval, although the
floating charge holder retains the same priority in respect of the proceeds from the disposal of the assets
subject to the floating charge. With prior approval of the court, an administrator may deal with property
subject to a fixed charge provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the administration’s
purpose and that the administrator applies the net proceeds from the disposal of the property in question,
together with any additional money required to be added to the net proceeds so as to produce the amount
determined by the court as the net amount which would be realised on a sale of the property at market value,
towards discharging the obligations of the company to the charge holder. These provisions do not apply
to any security interest created or otherwise arising under a financial collateral arrangement.

In Scotland, forms of security are closely tied to specific types of property. Since Scottish law does
not recognize the English law concept of “equity”, there is more focus on the legal formalities rather than
the intention of the parties with respect to the creation of security interests. Further, Scottish law does not
differentiate between legal and equitable ownership of property which further impacts the requirements to
create security. If the strict legal requirements under Scots law are not met, there will be no security over
the subject notwithstanding the intention of the parties.

In respect of moveable property, it is essential that the security holder has some form of possession
(which may take different forms) over the subject in order to create a valid fixed security interest. Scots law


-----

does not differentiate between legal and equitable ownership of property so, for instance, in order to create
a security interest over shares in companies incorporated in Scotland, the security holder (or its nominee)
must be registered as the shareholder. Furthermore, as there is no Scottish equivalent of an English law
equitable assignment, a Scottish interest in incorporeal property will only be created when the assignation is
intimated to the relevant parties.

Fixed charges over land and buildings situated in Scotland may only be created using a standard
security (which is similar to the English law legal mortgage over an interest of land) and is governed by
statute. The process of enforcing a fixed charge over land is very different to that in England and there is no
ability to appoint a fixed charge receiver over property.

**_Administration and Floating Charges_**

Under Scottish insolvency law, an administrator may be appointed in respect of (i) a company
incorporated in England and Wales or Scotland (however, in respect of a company incorporated under the
laws of England and Wales, the administrator would likely be appointed in England and Wales); (ii) a company
incorporated in an EEA state; (iii) a company not incorporated in an EEA state but with its COMI in the
United Kingdom or an EU Member State (other than Denmark); (iv) a company (wherever incorporated)
having its COMI in the United Kingdom; or (v) a company (wherever incorporated) with its COMI in an
EU Member State and an “establishment” in the United Kingdom. In addition to the court appointment
of an administrator, an administrator can be appointed out of court by the company, its directors or the
holder of a qualifying floating charge, which was granted by the company and which has become enforceable,
and different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointor. During the administration,
or after a notice of intention to appoint an administrator has been lodged, amongst other restrictions, in
general no proceedings or other legal process may be commenced or continued against the debtor, or security
enforced over the company’s property, except with leave of the court or the consent of the administrator.
Certain creditors of a company in administration may be able to realize their security over that
company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of
the moratorium in relation to a “security financial collateral agreement” (generally, cash or financial
instruments such as shares, bonds or tradable capital market debt instruments) under the Financial Collateral
Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003. If a Scottish Security Grantor were to enter administration, it is
possible that the security granted by it or the guarantee granted by it may not be enforced while it is in
administration. In addition, other than in limited circumstances, no administrative receiver can be appointed
by a secured creditor in preference to an administrator, and any already appointed must resign if requested
to do so by the administrator. Where the company is already in administration no other receiver may be
appointed.

In order to empower the Security Trustee to appoint an administrative receiver or an administrator
out of court to the company, the floating charge granted by the relevant Scottish Security Grantor must
constitute a “qualifying floating charge”for purposes of Scottish insolvency law and, in the case of the ability
to appoint an administrator, the Security Trustee must be the holder of a qualifying floating charge for
purposes of Scottish insolvency law and, in the case of the ability to appoint an administrative receiver, the
qualifying floating charge must, unless the security document predates September 15, 2003, fall within
one of the exceptions to the prohibition on the appointment of administrative receivers. In order to constitute
a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which (a) states that the
relevant statutory provision applies to it; (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of
the company; (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver; or (d) purports to
empower the holder of a floating charge in Scotland to appoint a receiver who on appointment would be an
administrative receiver (although this is only permitted under limited circumstances). The Security Trustee
will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if such floating charge security, together (if necessary) with
the fixed charge security interests granted to it, relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the
Scottish Security Grantor’s property and at least one such security interest is a qualifying floating charge.
The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the
exception relating to “capital market arrangements” (as defined in the Insolvency Act 1986, as amended),
which will apply if the issue of the notes creates a debt of at least £50,000,000 for the relevant company
during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital markets investment”
(which is defined in the Insolvency Act 1986, but is generally a rated, listed or traded debt instrument). An
administrator, receiver or liquidator of the company will be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the
proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security for the benefit of unsecured creditors. Under current
law, this applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of net floating charge realisations and 20% of the remainder over
£10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of £600,000, or £800,000 in relation to floating charges which


-----

come into existence on or after April 6, 2020. Whether the assets that are subject to the floating charges and
other security will constitute substantially the whole of the Scottish Security Grantor’s assets at the time
that the floating charges are enforced will be a question of fact at that time.

If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the
court (and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of
court procedure) and then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court
considers that the security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of
challenge on certain grounds. If an administrator is appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate
office. Further, upon the appointment of an administrator, any receiver of part of the company’s property
must resign if required to do so by the administrator unless that receiver was appointed under a charge
created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement” (as defined in the Financial
Collateral Regulations).

In addition, under Scottish insolvency law, any debt payable in a currency other than pounds
sterling (such as euro or U.S. dollars in the case of the notes) may, in certain circumstances, be claimed in a
currency other than pounds sterling. However, where creditors are asked to submit statements of claim,
that claim will then be converted into pounds sterling at the rate of exchange determined by the liquidator
or administrator by reference to the exchange rates prevailing in the London market at close of business on
the date when the company went into liqudation or administration. Accordingly, in the event that the
Scottish Security Grantor goes into liquidation or administration, holders of the notes may be subject to
exchange rate risk between the date that the Scottish Security Grantor went into liquidation or administration
and the date of receipt of any amounts to which such holders of the notes may become entitled. Any such
holder of the Notes would not be entitled to make a claim for any losses suffered by them as a result of a
decrease in value of pounds sterling between the “relevant date” and the date of any distribution.

There are circumstances under Scottish insolvency law in which the granting by a company of security
and guarantees can be challenged. In most cases, this will only arise if the company is placed into
administration or liquidation within a specified period of the granting of the guarantee or security,although
common law challenges can be brought beyond the specified period. Therefore, if during the specified
period an administrator is appointed to a Scottish Security Grantor, he may challenge the validity of the
guarantee or security given by such company. Further, the insolvency practitioner may elect to assign such
a right of action (including the proceeds therefrom) to another party who would then be entitled to pursue it.

The following potential grounds for challenge may apply to guarantees and security interests in
Scotland.

**_Gratuitous Alienations_**

Under Scottish insolvency law, a security interest or a guarantee granted by the company can be
challenged on the grounds that the creation of such security interest or guarantee constituted a gratuitous
alienation. Such a challenge can be brought by the administrator if the company enters administration, or if
the winding-up of the company has commenced, either by the liquidator or by any creditor who is a
creditor of the company by virtue of a debt incurred on or before the date of commencement of the windingup. The transaction can be challenged if the company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings
within a period of two years from the date the company grants the security interest or the guarantee (or
the date on which such security interest or guarantee becomes completely effectual) to a party which is not
an “associate” (as defined by reference to the Bankruptcy (Scotland) Act 2016) of the company, or within a
period of five years in the case of an “associate” of the company. A transaction might be subject to being
set aside as a gratuitous alienation if the company makes a gift to a person (except in certain specified
circumstances), if the company receives no consideration or if the company receives inadequate consideration
in respect of the transaction. However, a court generally will not intervene if the person seeking to uphold
the alienation establishes (i) that immediately or at any other time after the alienation the company’s assets
were greater than its liabilities, (ii) the alienation was made for adequate consideration, or (iii) the alienation
was a birthday, Christmas or other conventional gift, or (iv) the gift was made for a charitable purpose to a
person not an associate of the company, which having regard to all circumstances it was reasonable for
the company to make. If the court determines that the transaction was a gratuitous alienation the court can
grant a reduction or restoration of the property or assets or such other redress as may be appropriate
(although there is protection for a third party who acquires in good faith and for value any right or interest
from or through the transferee in the alienation).

A transaction made at a time when a company is insolvent may also constitute a gratuitous
alienation at common law. In these circumstances, no time limits apply in relation to challenging it. A


-----

gratuitous alienation may constitute wrongful (or indeed fraudulent) trading, or a breach of duty, and lead
to action being raised against directors personally.

**_Unfair Preferences_**

Under Scottish insolvency law, a security interest or a guarantee can be challenged on the grounds
that the security interest or such guarantee constituted an unfair preference in so far as it has the effect of
creating a preference in favor of a creditor to the prejudice of the general body of creditors. The transaction
can be challenged by the administrator if the company enters administration, or if the winding-up of the
company has commenced, either by the liquidator or any creditor of the company who is a creditor by virtue
of a debt incurred on or before the date of commencement of the winding-up. The transaction can be
challenged if the company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of six months
from the date the company grants the security interest or the guarantee (or the date on which such security
interest of guarantee becomes completely effectual). A transaction may constitute an unfair preference if it
has the effect of putting a creditor of the company (or a surety or Guarantor for any of the company’s
debts or liabilities) in a better position than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in
had that transaction not been entered into to the prejudice of the general body of creditors. If the court
determines that the transaction was an unfair preference, the court shall grant a reduction or restoration of
the property to the company’s assets or such other redress as may be appropriate (although there is
protection for a third party who acquires in good faith and for value any right or interest from or through
the creditor in whose favor the preference was created). The following will not constitute unfair preferences:

     - transactions in the ordinary course of trade or business;

    - payment in cash for a debt that, when paid, has become payable, unless the transaction was
collusive with the purpose of prejudicing the general body of creditors;

     - transactions where the parties take on reciprocal obligations, unless the transaction was collusive;
and

    - the granting of a mandate by a company authorising a person to pay over funds in compliance
with a court decree in certain prescribed circumstances.

A transaction may also constitute a fraudulent preference at common law (a fraudulent preference
is the common law equivalent of the statutory unfair preference). No time limits apply to a common law
challenge. An unfair preference may also constitute wrongful (or indeed fraudulent) trading or a breach of
duty and lead to actions being raised against directors personally.

**_Grant of Floating Charges_**

Under Scottish insolvency law, a floating charge granted by a company is invalid except to the
extent of the aggregate value of (i) the consideration for the creation of the floating charge consisting of
money paid or goods or services supplied to the company at the same time as or after the creation of the
floating charge, (ii) the value of the consideration consisting of the discharge or reduction of any debt of the
company at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge and (iii) the amount of any
interest payable on these sums, if the company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within
the relevant time period. The relevant time period is a period of one year (if the beneficiary is not a
connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) from the date the company grants
the floating charge. However, if the beneficiary is not a connected person, no amount of the floating
charge will be invalid unless the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due (as defined by Section 123
of the Insolvency Act 1986) or becomes unable to pay its debts as a consequence of granting the floating
charge. An administrator or liquidator (as applicable) does not need to apply to court for an order declaring
that a floating charge is invalid by operation of law. Any floating charge created during the relevant time
period is automatically invalid, except to the extent of the value of the foregoing amounts. However, this
provision does not apply to any charge created or otherwise arising under a “security financial collateral
arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations.

**Ranking of Security Interests**

Under Scots law, there are certain statutory and common law rules which will determine the
ranking of two or more competing security interests over the same assets. A number of different factors are
taken into account, such as the nature of the security interest, the order of creation, compliance with
perfection requirements and the order of giving notice. Scots law security interests are to be granted to
secure obligations under the Notes (which will also extend to obligations under the Existing Senior Secured


-----

Term Loans, the New Senior Secured Term Loans, the Existing Senior Secured Notes, certain hedging
liabilities and certain cash management liabilities); these security interests will be granted over the same assets
in respect of which security interests have already been granted in favor of the lenders under the Existing
Senior Secured Term Loans and the holders of the Existing Senior Secured Notes. Accordingly, without the
Intercreditor Deed, these new security interests would be likely to rank after the existing security interests.
However, the Intercreditor Deed provides that as a contractual matter as among Senior Creditors (as defined
in the Intercreditor Deed) the Notes will be secured on a pari passu basis with the Existing Senior Secured
Term Loans, the New Senior Secured Term Loans, the Existing Senior Secured Notes, certain hedging
liabilities and certain cash management liabilities and will be treated as such for the purposes of the
application of proceeds from the enforcement of such assets.

**Singapore**

The main legislation applicable to corporate insolvencies and reorganizations in Singapore, at the
date of this offering memorandum, is the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018 of Singapore
(the “IRDA”) which came into force on 30 July 2020. With the coming into force of the IRDA, the
provisions in the Companies Act 1967 of Singapore pertaining to corporate insolvency and restructuring
were repealed.

**_Difference in Insolvency Law_**

One of the Guarantors is incorporated under the laws of Singapore (the “Singapore Guarantor”).
Any insolvency proceedings applicable to the Singapore Guarantor will be likely to be governed by
Singapore insolvency laws. Singapore insolvency laws differ from the insolvency laws of the United States
and may make it more difficult for holders of the Notes to recover the amount in respect of the Singapore
Guarantor’s guarantee of the Notes and/or the Collateral securing the same than they would have recovered
in a liquidation or bankruptcy proceeding in the United States.

**_Priority of Secured Creditors_**

Singapore insolvency laws generally recognize the priority of secured creditors over unsecured
creditors. The lenders under the Senior Secured Term Loans have security interests on certain of the assets
of the Singapore Guarantor.

**_Security over Book Debts_**

Where security is taken over the book debt of a Singapore company by way of an assignment, the
Civil Law Act 1909 of Singapore prescribes that a statutory assignment must be by way of an absolute
assignment in writing under hand of the assignor, not purporting to be by way of charge only, and express
notice in writing thereof must be given to the debtor, trustee or other person from whom the assignor would
have been entitled to receive or claim such book debt. Where such notice is not given, the assignment is
only effective as an equitable assignment and a subsequent assignee of the book debt who gives notice might
have priority.

**_Fixed and Floating Charges_**

Fixed charges are superior to floating charges in a number of aspects. Until a floating charge
crystallizes, a company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to a floating charge in the ordinary
course of business, meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the chargor company so as to
give a third party good title to the assets free of the floating charge and so as to give rise to the risk of
security being granted over such assets in priority to the floating charge. In addition, a floating charge created
within one year (or, in the case of a floating charge created in favor of a person who is connected (as
defined in the IRDA) with the chargor company, two years) of the commencement of judicial management
or winding up of the chargor company is invalid except to the extent set out in the IRDA. Where the
assets of the chargor company are insufficient to pay certain preferential debts (these include winding up
costs, wages and salaries and retrenchment benefits), those preferential debts would have priority over debts
secured by a floating charge.

Amounts received in a winding-up or receivership from the realisation of assets subject to a
floating charge must first be used to pay the holders of any fixed charge over such assets and then certain
preferential creditors if applicable (explained above) before any distribution is made to the holders of a
floating charge.


-----

It is open to a court to find that assignments and charges described as fixed charges constitute
floating charges rather than fixed charges, the description given to them as fixed charges not being
determinative. One of the three characteristics of a floating charge is the ability of the chargor company to
carry on business in the ordinary course so far as concerns the particular class of assets in question until
some further step is taken by or on behalf of the chargee. Where the chargor company, without the consent
of the chargee, is free to deal with the assets or the proceeds of such assets that form the subject matter of
the charge, the court would be likely to hold that the charge in question constitutes a floating charge,
notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge. In addition, to the extent that any of the assets
secured by the Collateral are not specifically identified, an insolvency official may hold that such assets, which
are expressed to be subject to a fixed charge, may in fact be subject to a floating charge.

**_Preferential Creditors_**

Under the IRDA, in a winding-up of a Singapore company preferential debts are required to be
paid in priority to all other debts other than those secured by a fixed charge. Certain preferential debts
therefore have priority over debts secured by a floating charge (i.e., those listed in paragraphs (a) to (c) and
(e) to (f) below) if the assets of the chargor company are insufficient to satisfy such preferential debts. The
preferential debts covered by the relevant sections of the IRDA are described briefly below:
(a) costs and expenses of the winding up;

(b) employees’ wages and salaries, including gratuity or other sum of money due and owing to
an employee on his retirement or on termination of his services pursuant to a collective
agreement or an award;

(c) retrenchment benefits or ex gratia payments under employment contracts;

(d) work injury compensation under the Work Injury Compensation Act 2019 of Singapore;

(e) certain amounts due under employee’s superannuation or provident funds or under any
scheme of superannuation which is an approved scheme under the Income Tax Act 1947 of
Singapore;

(f) other remuneration payable to employees such as vacation leave and death benefits; and

(g) taxes assessed and goods and services tax.

Under the IRDA, in a winding-up of a Singapore company, certain claims (if they exist) also rank
ahead of a fixed charge, including (without limitation) claims of workmen or employees with salaries of up
to the amounts set out in the Employment Act 1968 of Singapore.

**_Limitation on Enforcement_**

The grant of a guarantee or collateral by a Singapore company for the obligations of another
group company must be for the corporate benefit of the granting company. The question of corporate
benefit is determined on a case-by-case basis and at the time when such guarantee or collateral is provided
considering the totality of the circumstances at that point in time.

Under Singapore law, if there is no corporate benefit justifiable for a Singapore company to
provide guarantee or security interest securing another group company’s obligations, such provision of
guarantee or security interest can raise a breach of fiduciary duty issue for the directors of such Singapore
company. In such situation, the directors could be sued by the Singapore company for damages suffered.

**_Transactions at Undervalue or Unfair Preference_**

Under the IRDA, if a Singapore company goes into liquidation or judicial management, and has
entered into certain transactions at an undervalue within a period of three years before commencement of
winding up or judicial management, or has entered into a transaction by way of unfair preference within a
period of one year (a two-year period applies in the case of a transaction with a person who is connected
with the company (as defined in the IRDA)) before the commencement of winding up or judicial management,
those transactions may be liable to be made void or voidable.

**_Disclaimer of Onerous Contracts_**

The IRDA provides that a liquidator or judicial manager may, by giving notice to the creditors and
the Official Receiver, disclaim, save in certain circumstances, any unprofitable contract, or any other property


-----

of the company which is unsaleable, is not readily saleable, or may give rise to a liability of the company to
pay money or perform any other onerous act (“Onerous Property”). The Singapore court may make certain
orders where a liquidator or judicial manager has disclaimed Onerous Property, such as setting aside the
disclaimer or make such order as the court thinks just where the injury caused by the disclaimer outweighs
any advantage likely to be gained by the liquidator or judicial manager.

**_Certain Contractual Rights Limited_**

The IRDA limits the exercise of certain contractual rights, such as terminating an agreement,
claiming an accelerated payment or forfeiture of term under any agreement (including a security agreement)
with a Singapore company, by reason only that certain restructuring proceedings in respect of the company
have commenced or that the company is insolvent.

**_Enforcement Process_**

_Receivership_

Receivership arises principally by way of enforcement of the right of the holders of security under
mortgage or charges, as set out in the security document. The receiver is, in effect, an agent of the chargor
company. Its rights and obligations are usually set out in the security document itself.

The IRDA expressly provides that a receiver is personally liable on any contract he or she entered
into in the performance of his or her functions (except insofar as the contract otherwise provides) and, to
the extent of any qualifying liability, on any contract of employment adopted by him or her in the performance
of those functions. A receiver is however entitled to an indemnity out of the property of the company or
corporation.

_Appointment_

Receivers can be appointed on the basis of the powers set out in the security document. A person
appointed on the basis of a fixed charge over specific assets will act as receiver in respect of those assets.
However, mortgages containing a floating charge over all of the assets and undertaking typically provide for
enforcement by means of the appointment of a receiver having full powers as a receiver and manager over
all of the secured assets (i.e., all of the assets and undertaking of a chargor company), including the power of
sale of the assets.

**Switzerland**

**_Limitations on guarantees and securities provided by the Swiss Guarantors_**

Certain of the Guarantors are incorporated in Switzerland (the “Swiss Guarantors”).

The validity or enforceability of a security interest granted or a guarantee issued by a Swiss
Guarantor may be limited by applicable debt collection and bankruptcy laws, insolvency, re-organization,
corporate, tax, contract or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting creditors and secured parties in
general (including provisions relating to fraudulent transfer, voidable preference, corporate purpose,
financial assistance, capital maintenance and solvency) or laws or principles of general application (including
the abuse of rights (Rechtsmissbrauch) and the principle of good faith (Grundsatz von Treu und Glauben)
and public policy.

In particular, Swiss rules regarding capital maintenance, including but not limited to Articles 671,
672, 675(2), 675(3) and 680(2) of the Swiss Code of Obligations, prohibit the direct or indirect repayment
of a Swiss corporation’s share capital and legal reserves to its shareholders and restrict the distribution of a
Swiss corporation’s accrued earnings to its shareholders. Guarantees, share pledges, assignments for
security purposes and any other collateral granted by a Swiss corporation in order to guarantee or secure
liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company as well as any other undertaking contained in any
agreement having the same or a similar effect, such as, but not limited to, the waiver of set off or
subrogation rights, the subordination of intra-group claims or any other financial obligation (including, but
not limited to, indemnity obligations) may be considered as an indirect distribution of assets which are
subject to the limitation provided by Swiss law to protect the share capital and legal reserves of Swiss
corporation. Similar rules apply in case the guarantee or collateral is granted, or other financial obligation
is assumed, by a Swiss limited liability company (GmbH). Therefore, it is standard market practice for
indenture agreements, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to contain so-called
“limitation language” in relation to Swiss subsidiaries or sister companies essentially providing for that if


-----

and to the extent a Swiss Guarantor becomes liable under the relevant agreement for obligations of any
direct or indirect shareholder (upstream security) or subsidiary of such shareholder (cross-stream security)
other than direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of such Swiss Guarantor (the “Restricted
Obligations”) and if complying with such obligations would constitute a repayment of capital
(Einlagerückgewähr), a violation of the legally protected reserves (gesetzlich geschützte Reserven) or the
payment of a (constructive) dividend (Gewinnausschüttung) by such Swiss Guarantor or would otherwise
be restricted under Swiss law and practice then applicable, such Swiss Guarantor’s aggregate liability for
Restricted Obligations shall not exceed the amount of the Swiss Guarantor’s freely disposable equity (frei
verfügbares Eigenkapital) at the time of the enforcement of the guarantee (or other financial obligation) or,
as the case may be, any collateral (the “Maximum Amount”), and providing for that if the secured/
guaranteed obligations are Restricted Obligations, then any payment triggered by the enforcement of the
security interest/guarantee (including, in particular, Swiss withholding tax of currently 35% on a deemed
dividend distribution or of a lower tax rate resulting from a refund procedure applicable under a doubletaxation treaty) would equally be limited by the Maximum Amount. The Restricted Obligations are only
valid if approved by the general meeting at the time of enforcement in accordance Swiss law and applicable
Swiss accounting principles. There are restrictions for companies that have obtained a COVID-19 credit,
including the prohibition, amongst other things, of distribution of dividend as long as such credit has not
been repaid or terminated. As a result, the creditors to be secured by any Restricted Obligations should take
into account that the actual value of such Restricted Obligations may be very limited. This shall in particular
be relevant for the purpose of the Guarantee (or any other security) to be granted by a Swiss Guarantor
for the benefits of the holders of the Notes.

**_Insolvency_**

In the event of insolvency, insolvency proceedings relating to a Swiss Guarantor’s Guarantee and
any security interests provided by such Swiss Guarantor would likely be subject to Swiss insolvency law.
Swiss insolvency law may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the laws of the United States
or other jurisdictions with which you may be familiar. The following is a brief description of certain aspects
of insolvency law in Switzerland. In the event that the Issuer or the Parent or any of its Swiss subsidiaries
experienced financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions
insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Pursuant to
Swiss insolvency laws, your ability to receive payment under the Notes may be more limited that would be the
case under U.S. or other non-Swiss insolvency laws. Under Swiss law, there are two primary insolvency
regimes, the bankruptcy procedure (Konkurs) and the composition procedure (Nachlassvertrag) (altogether
referred to as insolvency proceedings) that may be opened against an entity having it registered offices or
assets in Switzerland.

In the event of a Swiss entity’s insolvency, the respective insolvency proceedings would be governed
by Swiss law as a result of such Swiss entity’s offices being registered in the competent commercial register
in Switzerland. In addition, Swiss debt enforcement and insolvency laws may be applicable in case of an
enforcement of security interests over assets of a foreign entity located in Switzerland. The enforcement
of claims and questions relating to insolvency and bankruptcy in general are dealt with by the Swiss Federal
Act on Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy, as amended from time to time. Under these rules, claims that
are pursued against a Swiss entity can lead to the opening of bankruptcy (Konkurs) and, hence, a general
liquidation of all assets, even if located outside Switzerland, and liabilities of the debtor. However, with
regard to assets located outside Switzerland, a Swiss bankruptcy decree is enforceable only if it is recognized
at the place where such assets are located. Creditors secured by a pledge must generally initiate enforcement
proceedings pursuant to the Swiss Federal Act on Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy except in the event
that (i) the parties have agreed on a private enforcement; or (ii) the security provider has been adjudicated
bankrupt. A private enforcement is subject to certain requirements (including notification and pricing
requirement) and is generally to be made in accordance with the principles of good faith, adequately taking
into account the interests of the security provider. If the security provider has been adjudicated bankrupt,
secured creditors participate in the bankruptcy proceedings with the other creditors and a private enforcement
is no longer permitted. Certain particular rules apply to security interests created over intermediated
securities pursuant to the Swiss Federal Intermediated Securities Act.

As a rule, the opening of bankruptcy by the competent court needs to be preceded by a prior debt
enforcement procedure which involves, inter alia, the issuance of a payment summons by local debt
enforcement authorities (Betreibungsamt). However, the competent court may also declare a debtor bankrupt
without such prior proceedings if the following requirements are met: (i) at the request of the debtor, if
the debtor’s board of directors or the auditors of the company (in case of failure of the board of directors)


-----

declare that the debtor is overindebted (überschuldet) within the meaning of art. 725 b of the Swiss Code
of Obligations or if it declares to be insolvent (zahlungsunfähig), and (ii) at the request of a creditor, if the
debtor commits certain acts to the detriment of its creditors or ceases to make payments (Zahlungseinstellung)
or if certain events happen during composition proceedings. The bankruptcy proceedings are carried out
and the bankrupt estate is managed by the receiver in bankruptcy (Konkursverwaltung). which will draw up
an inventory of the assets and, further to a creditor’s call for the filling of claims, establish a schedule of
claims (Kollakationsplan).

All assets at the time of the declaration of bankruptcy and all assets acquired or received
subsequently form the bankrupt estate which, after deduction of costs and certain other expenses, is used
to satisfy the creditors. However, in respect of assets located abroad, the Swiss authorities do not have
jurisdiction to collect such assets for the purpose of including them in the Swiss bankruptcy estate of the
debtor. It is therefore the foreign law applicable at the place where the assets are located abroad, or treaties
between Switzerland and the state in which such assets are located, that will determine whether and to what
extent the foreign authorities can assist in the collection of these assets. Assets of the bankrupt estate over
which a pledge was created in favor of a creditor before the declaration of bankruptcy are included in the
bankrupt estate. The pledgee is under an obligation to remit the pledged assets to the bankrupt estate.
The assets are liquidated by the receiver in bankruptcy in the same manner as the other assets of the bankrupt
estate, but the creditor secured by the pledge retains its privilege to be satisfied from the proceeds of the
liquidation of the assets pledged to it with priority over the unsecured creditors. Final distribution of nonsecured claims is based on a ranking of creditors in three classes. The first and the second class, which are
privileged, comprise claims under employment contracts, accident insurance, pension plans and family
law. Certain privileges can also be claimed by the government and its subdivisions based on specific provisions
of Swiss Federal law. All other creditors are treated equally in the third class. A secured party participates
in the third class to the extent its claim is not covered by its collateral.

The notification to the debtors of the claims assignment is not a legal requirement for the validity
thereof. However, until such time as any debtor of the receivables has been notified of the claims assignment,
such debtor may validly discharge its debt in the hands of the assignor, thereby voiding the security
interest. The foregoing is of particular relevance in the context of assignment of trade receivables where
such assignment is generally not notified to the debtors until the occurrence of an event of default.

Claims assigned for security purposes by a Swiss entity that come into existence prior to the
opening of bankruptcy can be enforced by the assignee outside Swiss bankruptcy proceedings. Assigned
claims that come into existence after the opening of bankruptcy over a Swiss entity may fall within the
bankrupt estate, and the assignee may not be entitled to such claim proceeds.

Any creditor wishing to contest the schedule of claims because his claim has been entirely or
partially rejected by the receiver in bankruptcy or not allocated in the rank requested must bring an action
against the estate before the competent court. If any creditor wishes to contest the admission of another
creditor to the schedule of claims or the allocated rank, he must bring an action against such creditor.
Such court proceedings could cause the holders of the Notes to recover less than the principal amount of
their notes or less than they could recover in a United States liquidation. Such proceedings could also cause
payment to the holders of the Notes to be delayed, as compared with holders of undisputed claims.

With the opening of bankruptcy proceedings, interest ceases to accrue against the debtor. However,
interest on claims secured by pledges continues to accrue until the realisation of the pledge, provided the
proceeds exceed the amount of the claim and the interest which had accrued by the date of the opening of
bankruptcy proceedings.

Swiss insolvency laws also provide for reorganization procedures by composition with the debtor’s
creditors. Reorganization is initiated by a request with the competent court for a stay (Nachlassstundung)
pending negotiation of the composition agreement with the creditors and confirmation of such agreement by
the competent court. A distinction is made between a composition agreement providing for the assignment
of assets (Nachlassvertrag mit Vermögensabtretung) which leads to a private enforcement and in many
instances has analogous effects as a bankruptcy, and a dividend composition (Dividenden-Vergleich)
providing for the payment of a certain percentage on the creditors’ claims and the continuation of the
debtor. Further, there is the possibility of a composition in the form of a mere payment term extension
(Stundungsvergleich). During a moratorium, debt collection proceedings cannot be initiated and pending
proceedings are stayed. Furthermore, the debtor’s power to dispose of its assets and to manage its affairs is
restricted. In case of a pledge, the secured party is not entitled to proceed with a private enforcement
until the confirmation of the settlement by the competent court. A secured creditor participates in the


-----

settlement only for the amount of its claim not covered by the collateral. The moratorium does not affect
the agreed due dates of debts (contrary to bankruptcy, in which case all debts become immediately due upon
adjudication). The moratorium aims at facilitating the conclusion of one of the above composition
agreements. Any composition agreement needs to be approved by the creditors and confirmed by the
competent court. With the judicial confirmation, the composition agreement becomes binding on all
creditors, whereby secured claims are only subject to the composition agreement to the extent that the
collateral proves to be insufficient to cover the secured claims.

Foreign bankruptcy decrees issued in the country of a debtor’s domicile may be recognized in
Switzerland only, provided that (i) the bankruptcy decree is enforceable in the country where it was issued,
(ii) its recognition is, inter alia, not against Swiss public policy, and (iii) the bankruptcy decree was issued
(a) in the state of the debtor’ domicile or (b) in the state where the center of the debtor’s main interests
are located, provided that the debtor was not domiciled in Switzerland when the foreign bankruptcy
proceedings were initiated.

**_Security in the form of pledge_**

Under Swiss law, a valid pledge only arises if the pledgor loses the exclusive possession over the
pledged assets (which includes the delivery of the share certificates representing all shares in the Swiss
Guarantor whose share are pledged duly endorsed in blank). Until a pledgor loses exclusive control over
the assets purported to be pledged under a Swiss pledge agreement, a third party may acquire preferential
property rights over such assets, including a right of pledge.

Any undertaking to pledge assets which is granted by a Swiss Guarantor is a way that is being used
in practice in Switzerland whereby an undertaking to pledge is entered into initially and the pledge is
perfected at a later stage if certain events occur. One should also be aware that the pledge to be created
under the undertaking to pledge upon the occurrence of certain events may be challenged under Swiss
avoidance rules.

Under Swiss conflict of law rules, although Swiss law permits a choice of law with respect to a
pledge of shares or an assignment of bank accounts, such choice of law may not be opposable to third
parties.

A sale or transfer of shares in a Swiss Guarantor in the context of the realisation of the share
pledge agreement concerning such shares may be subject to Swiss transfer stamp duty if a Swiss securities
dealer, as defined in the Swiss stamp tax act, is involved in the transaction as party or intermediary.

Under Swiss law, pledges are accessory to the obligations they secure and, therefore, pledges may
only be constituted for the benefit of the creditors of the secured obligations. Any pledge governed by
Swiss law to secure claims of the holders of the Notes under the Indenture should therefore be constituted
for the benefit of the holders of the Notes acting as pledgees (being represented for the purposes thereof by
the Security Trustee acting in its capacity as security agent for itself and as direct representative (direkter
Stellvertreter) in the name and for the account of each other pledgees). Because any such pledge is likely to
be constituted for the benefit of the Security Trustee acting as a fiduciary (Treuhänder) in its own name
but for the benefit of the holders of the Notes (but not as a direct representative (direkter Stellvertreter) acting
in its own name and in the name and for the account of each other Secured Party), there is a risk regarding
the enforceability of such pledge granted in favor of the holders of the Notes. In order to mitigate these
risks and in order to give the Security Trustee as much flexibility as possible, the Intercreditor Deed provides
for the creation of a parallel debt structure, whereby the pledge would not directly secure the claims of the
holders of the Notes but an independent claim of the Security Trustee stated to be at all times equal to the
outstanding claims of the holders of the Notes, under in particular, the Notes and the Indenture. Under
this structure the holders of the Notes will bear some risks associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy
of the Security Trustee. There are no published court decisions confirming the validity of the parallel debt
structure and hence it is uncertain whether such structure would be valid and enforceable under Swiss law as
it could be viewed as a circumvention of the accessory nature of the pledge.

**_Avoidance_**

Certain arrangements or dispositions that are made during a certain period (the “suspect period”)
preceding the declaration of bankruptcy or the confirmation of a composition agreement with assignment
of assets (Nachlassvertrag mit Vermögensabtretung) may be challenged by the receiver in bankruptcy
(Konkursverwaltung) and certain creditors under the applicable rules of avoidance. The avoidance may
relate to (i) gifts, gratuitous transactions and transactions pursuant to which the debtor received consideration


-----

which was disproportionate to its own performance made in the suspect period of 12 months prior to being
declared bankrupt or the confirmation of a composition agreement with assignment of assets
(Nachlassvertrag mit Vermögensabtretung), (ii) certain acts of a debtor (e.g. repayment of a debt which has
not yet fallen due, settlement of a debt by unusual means of payment, granting of a collateral for previously
unsecured liabilities without previously being obliged to do so) in the suspect period of 12 months prior to
being declared bankrupt or the confirmation of a composition agreement with assignment of assets
(Nachlassvertrag mit Vermögensabtretung) if the debtor at that time was overindebted, and (iii) dispositions
made by the debtor within a suspect period of five years prior to being declared bankrupt or the
confirmation of a composition agreement with assignment of assets (Nachlassvertrag mit
Vermögensabtretung) with the intent, identifiable by the other party, to disadvantage its creditors or to
prefer certain of its creditors to the detriment of other creditors. In case of avoidance action regarding a
disposition in favor of an affiliated person, including a group company, the favored person bears the burden
of proof that the intent of disadvantaging the creditors was not identifiable. The transactions potentially
subject to avoidance also include those contemplated by a Swiss entity’s guarantee of the Notes or the
granting of security interests under the Security Documents by a Swiss entity. If they are challenged
successfully, the rights granted by a Swiss entity under the guarantee of the Notes or in connection with
security interests under the Security Documents may become unenforceable and any amounts received must
be refunded to the bankrupt estate. The creditors (such as the holders of the Notes) who have restituted
the avoided amount paid to them regain their original claims against the relevant Swiss Guarantor and are
entitled to list their claims in the schedule of claims in their respective rank and priority. The Swiss principles
on avoidance may therefore limit the holders of the Notes’ ability to recover payments due under the
Guarantees or security interest.

**United States**

**_Fraudulent Transfer_**

Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer or
fraudulent conveyance laws, the incurrence of the obligations under the Notes, the issuance of the guarantees
and the grant of security, whether now or in the future, by the Issuer and the Guarantors (together, the
“Obligors”) could be avoided, if, among other things, at the time the Obligors incurred the obligations, issued
the related guarantee or gave the security, the Obligors intended to hinder, delay or defraud any present or
future creditor; or received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the incurrence of
such indebtedness or the grant of such security and either:

     - were insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence or grant of security;

     - were engaged in a business or transaction for which the Obligors’ remaining assets constituted
unreasonably small capital; or

     - intended to incur, or believed that they would incur, debts beyond their ability to pay such debts
as they mature.

A U.S. court would likely find that an Obligor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair
consideration for the Notes offered hereby or such guarantee if such Obligor did not benefit directly or
indirectly from the issuance of the Notes or the applicable guarantee.

We cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether or not an
Obligor was solvent at the relevant time or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, that payments to
holders of the Notes offered hereby constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds. Generally, however,
an entity would be considered insolvent by a U.S. court if, at the time it incurred indebtedness:

     - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all
its assets;

     - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to
pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become
absolute and mature; or

     - it could not pay its debts as they become due.

If the Notes offered hereby or guarantees were avoided or limited under fraudulent transfer or
other laws, any claim you may make against any Obligor for amounts payable on the Notes offered hereby
would be unenforceable to the extent of such avoidance or limitation. Moreover, the court could order you to
return any payments previously made by any Obligor.


-----

Although any guarantee entered into in connection with the issuance of the Notes offered hereby
will contain a provision intended to limit that guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could
incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer, this
provision may not be effective to protect such guarantee from being voided under fraudulent transfer law, or
may reduce that guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its guarantee worthless.

**_Federal Insolvency Proceedings_**

Certain Obligors may have operations that would be subject either to proceedings under title 11 of
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any applicable state law insolvency proceedings. Proceedings under the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code vary and provide a debtor with discretion in its pursuit of a liquidation or reorganization
strategy, subject to the rights of creditors and other parties in interest to object and seek relief from the
bankruptcy court. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code provides a detailed statutory framework that, among other
things, contains terms or provisions relating to:

     - the administration of a bankruptcy case, including (i) the imposition of the automatic stay,
which immediately stays all litigation, as well as most enforcement and other actions against the
debtors or property of the bankruptcy estate; (ii) provision of “adequate protection” to secured
creditors to protect against diminution of value of their collateral; (iii) terms for the use, sale or
lease of property; (iv) standards for obtaining post-petition credit; and (v) rules regarding the
treatment of executory contracts and unexpired leases;

     - creditors and claims, including deadlines and requirements for filing proofs of claim, the priority
and allowance of claims, and subordination of claims; and

     - creation of the bankruptcy estate, including the scope of property of the estate and ability to
bring turnover and avoidance actions, provisions relating to liquidation under chapter 7 of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code, reorganization under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and the
filing of ancillary and other cross-border insolvency cases under chapter 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code.

As a general matter, chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code provides for the orderly liquidation of
the debtor’s assets by a trustee appointed by the bankruptcy court and typically results in the immediate
shutdown of the debtor’s business. Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code is available to debtors who seek
to continue to operate their business as a going concern while they reorganise their businesses and resolve
their obligations to creditors (although a liquidation or sale under chapter 11 is also possible), in each case
pursuant to a plan of reorganization or liquidation, as applicable. Unlike in a chapter 7 bankruptcy case, in a
chapter 11 bankruptcy case the debtor typically remains in possession of its assets and continues to
operate its business during the course of the bankruptcy case (subject to the supervision of the bankruptcy
court), with substantially the rights that a trustee would otherwise have. In addition, “liquidating”
chapter 11 cases may be used as an alternative to a liquidation under chapter 7, particularly in an instance
when the debtor seeks to maintain the “going-concern value” of its business and/or expects to sell all or
substantially all of its assets free and clear of liens during the course of the bankruptcy case.

Because bankruptcy proceedings are often fact specific and vary case-by-case, and because
bankruptcy courts are courts of equity with broad discretionary powers, a detailed summary of all the
provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code that could affect the Notes and/or the guarantees and security is
not contained herein. Furthermore, the common law applicable in bankruptcy proceedings may vary from
jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and this summary is not intended to cover the common law that may apply in any
particular jurisdiction.

**_Preference_**

Any future grant of security interest with regard to the Collateral in favor of the Notes, including
pursuant to security documents delivered after the date of the Indenture, might be avoidable in a
U.S. bankruptcy case by the grantor (as debtor-in-possession) or by its bankruptcy trustee as a preference if
certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if the grantor is insolvent at the
time of the grant, the security interest permits the holders of the Notes to receive a greater recovery than if
the bankruptcy case were a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code and the security had not been
given and a bankruptcy case in respect of the grantor is commenced within 90 days following the grant, or
in certain circumstances, a longer period.


-----

**_The Automatic Stay_**

The right of a holder of the Notes to enforce its security interests against the Obligors upon the
occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture is likely to be significantly impaired by applicable
U.S. bankruptcy law if one or more of the Obligors became a debtor in a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code before such security interest was enforced. Upon the commencement of a case under the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor such as a holder of Notes is prohibited by the automatic stay
imposed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code from taking any act to obtain possession of or exercise control over,
property of the bankruptcy estate. The automatic stay in a bankruptcy case of one or more of the Obligors
could therefore prevent the holders of the Notes from obtaining possession or exercising control over the
Collateral or commencing any action in an attempt to obtain possession or exercise control over the
Collateral. The automatic stay could be lifted or modified with bankruptcy court approval in certain
circumstances, but parties may object to any creditor request to lift or modify the automatic stay, and the
bankruptcy court deny such a request.

**_Right of Debtor-In-Possession to Remain In Control of Collateral and the Bankruptcy Process_**

An entity that becomes a debtor under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code remains in
possession of its property and is authorized to operate and manage its business as a “debtor-in-possession,”
subject to certain limitations. This remains the case unless a chapter 11 trustee is appointed or the chapter 11
case is converted to a chapter 7 liquidation under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

Moreover, the U.S. Bankruptcy Code permits the debtor to continue to retain and use collateral
even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured
creditor is given “adequate protection”of its interest in the debtor’s property. The term “adequate protection”
is not defined in the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, but it may include making periodic cash payments, providing
an additional or replacement lien or granting other relief, in each case to the extent that the collateral decreases
in value during the pendency of the bankruptcy case as a result of, among other things, the use, sale or
lease of such collateral or the imposition of the automatic stay.

The type of adequate protection provided to a secured creditor may vary according to circumstances.
A U.S. bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor is not entitled to additional adequate
protection for a diminution in the value of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the amount of
the debt that it secures.

Only the debtor in a chapter 11 bankruptcy case may propose a chapter 11 plan unless the debtor
fails to file a plan within the first 120 days of the case or fails to solicit sufficient acceptances of its plan
within the first 180 days of the case. The bankruptcy court may reduce or enlarge these periods. The 120-day
period could be extended for up to 18 months after a chapter 11 filing, while the 180-day period could be
extended for up to 20 months after a chapter 11 filing. During these “exclusive periods,” other parties such
as secured creditors would be precluded from proposing or soliciting acceptances of their own chapter 11
plans.

In view of the automatic stay, the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection,”
the exclusive periods, and the broad discretionary power of a U.S. bankruptcy court, it is impossible to
predict:

     - whether or when a holder of the Notes could enforce its security interests;

     - the value of the collateral at the time of the bankruptcy petition or at the time a chapter 11 plan
is proposed or confirmed; or

    - whether or to what extent holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment
or loss of value of the collateral through the requirement of “adequate protection.”

**_A Debtor-In-Possession May Obtain New Credit Secured By a Lien That is Senior or Equal to Existing Liens_**

The U.S. Bankruptcy Code permits a debtor-in-possession or trustee in a chapter 11 case to obtain
an extension of new credit from an existing lender or from a new lender. The bankruptcy court may,
depending on the facts and circumstances, authorize the debtor-in-possession or trustee to obtain new
credit or incur new debt that is secured by a lien that is senior or equal to existing liens. In other words, it is
possible that in connection with a chapter 11 case of one or more of the Obligors, such Obligor or Obligors
would be permitted to incur new debt that is secured by a lien that is senior or equal to the liens that exist at
the time of the chapter 11 filing.


-----

**_Ability to Confirm a Chapter 11 Plan Notwithstanding the Dissenting Votes of Creditors_**

Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a chapter 11 plan can be imposed on a creditor or equityholder
(or class of creditors or equityholders) that does not accept the plan. A chapter 11 plan provides for the
comprehensive treatment of all claims asserted against the debtor and its property, and may provide for the
readjustment or extinguishment of equity interests. Claims and interests may be classified by type. Only
those classes of claims and interests impaired by the plan may vote to accept or reject such plan. Classes of
claims and interests that are unimpaired are not entitled to vote on the plan, and are deemed to accept it.
Classes of claims and interest that receive no distributions under the plan are not entitled to vote on the plan,
and are deemed to reject it.

A class of claims is deemed to accept the plan if more than one-half in number of claims holders
and two-thirds in claims amount in that class vote in favor of the plan. A plan can be confirmed by the
bankruptcy court over the dissenting votes of members of a class that accepts the plan overall. Furthermore,
even if one or more impaired classes reject the plan, it may still be confirmed, subject to specific statutory
requirements, in accordance with the “cram-down” provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, so long as the
plan does not discriminate unfairly, and is fair and equitable, with respect to each class of claims or
interests that is impaired under, and has not accepted, the plan. This could allow the debtor or other plan
proponent to confirm its plan over the objection of one or more dissenting classes.

**BOOK-ENTRY; DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

The Dollar Notes sold to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the
U.S. Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without
interest coupons attached (the “Rule 144A Dollar Global Notes”). The Dollar Notes sold outside the United
States to non-U.S. persons in reliance on Regulation S will initially be represented by one or more global
notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Dollar Global Notes”).

The Euro Notes sold to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the
U.S. Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without
interest coupons attached (the “Rule 144A Euro Global Notes”). The Euro Notes sold outside the United
States to non-U.S. persons in reliance on Regulation S will initially be represented by one or more global notes
in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Euro Global Notes”). The Rule 144A
Dollar Global Notes and the Regulation S Dollar Global Notes are collectively referred to herein as the
“Dollar Global Notes”. The Rule 144A Euro Global Notes and the Regulation S Euro Global Notes are
collectively referred to herein as the “Euro Global Notes”. The Rule 144A Dollar Global Notes and the
Rule 144A Euro Global Notes are collectively referred to as the “Rule 144A Global Notes”. The Regulation S
Dollar Global Notes and the Regulation S Euro Global Notes are collectively referred to as the
“Regulation S Global Notes”. The Rule 144A Global Notes and the Regulation S Global Notes are
collectively referred to as the “Global Notes”.

The Dollar Global Notes will be deposited upon issuance with the custodian for The Depository
Trust Company (“DTC”) and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC. The Euro Global
Notes will be deposited with, or on behalf of, a common depositary (the “Common Depositary”) for the
accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream and registered in the name of the nominee of the Common
Depositary.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (the “Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests”) and
in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, collectively with the
Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts
with DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or persons that hold interests through such
participants. Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through,
records maintained in book-entry form by DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream and their participants. The
Book-Entry Interests in the Dollar Global Notes will be issued only in denominations of $200,000 and integral
multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof and the Book-Entry Interests in the Euro Global Notes will be issued
only in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

The Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, DTC, Euroclear or
Clearstream, as applicable, will credit on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems a
participant’s account with the interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions,
including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical
delivery of such securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer
or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry
Interests will not have the Notes registered in their name, will not have received physical delivery of the Notes
in certificated form and will not be considered the registered owners or “holders” of Notes under the
Indenture for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the custodian for DTC (or its nominee) or the
Common Depositary for Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or their respective nominees), as applicable, will be
considered the sole holder of the Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. As such, participants
must rely on the procedures of DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and indirect participants must
rely on the procedures of DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and the participants through
which they own Book-Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders of Notes
under the Indenture.

Neither the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Registrar, the Common Depositary, the nominee of the
Common Depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, DTC, the nominee of the custodian for DTC, the
Trustee under the Indenture nor any of the Issuer’s respective agents will have any responsibility or be liable
for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.


-----

**Issuance of Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of Book-Entry Interests will receive Notes in definitive
registered form (the “Definitive Registered Notes”):

(1) if DTC (with respect to the Dollar Global Notes) or Euroclear or Clearstream (with
respect to the Euro Global Notes) notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to
continue to act as depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer
within 120 days;

(2) if DTC (with respect to the Dollar Global Notes) or Euroclear or Clearstream (with
respect to the Euro Global Notes) so requests following an Event of Default (as defined
under “Description of the Notes”) under the Indenture; or

(3) if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through
DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, following an event of default under the
Indenture.

DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a BookEntry Interest described in the immediately preceding clause (3), their current procedure is to request that
the Issuer issues or causes to be issued Definitive Registered Notes to all owners of Book-Entry Interests and
not only to the owner who made the initial request.

In such an event, the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or
names and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of DTC, Euroclear or
Clearstream, as applicable, or the Issuer, as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary
procedures and based upon directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of BookEntry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend as provided in the
Indenture, unless that legend is not required by the Indenture or applicable law.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream,
as applicable, will distribute the amount received by it in respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the
holders of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the
redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such
Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable,
in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuer understands that
under existing practices of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the relevant Notes are to
be redeemed at any time, DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts
on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or on such other basis as they
deem fair and appropriate; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than $200,000, in the case
of the Dollar Global Notes or €100,000, in the case of the Euro Global Notes, principal amount at
maturity, or less, may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

Payments of amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium,
interest, additional interest and additional amounts, if any) will be made by the Issuer to the Paying Agent.
The Paying Agent will, in turn, make such payments to DTC (in the case of the Dollar Global Notes) or
to Euroclear and/or Clearstream (in the case of the Euro Global Notes), which will distribute such payments
to participants in accordance with their respective procedures.

Under the terms of the Indenture governing the Notes, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent,
the Registrar and the Paying Agent will treat the registered holder of the Global Notes (for example, DTC,
Euroclear or Clearstream (or their respective nominees)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving
payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, neither the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee, the
Registrar, the Transfer Agent nor any Paying Agent or any of their respective agents has or will have any
responsibility or liability for:

    - any aspects of the records of DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect
participant relating to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest, for any such
payments made by DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or


-----

for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any
participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry
Interest; or

    - payments made by DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or
for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any
participant or indirect participant relating to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry
Interest; or

    - DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the
responsibility of such participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of subscribers
registered in “street name.”

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the
Dollar Global Notes will be paid to holders of interest in such notes (the “DTC Holders”) through DTC in
dollars. The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of,
the Euro Global Notes will be paid to holders of interest in such notes (the “Euroclear/Clearstream Holders”)
through Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, in euro.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted
to be taken by a holder of Notes (including the presentation of Notes for exchange as described above)
only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global
Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which
such participant or participants has or have given such direction. DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream will
not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents or waivers or the taking of any other action in respect
of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under the Notes, each of DTC, Euroclear
and Clearstream reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for Definitive Registered Notes, and to
distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to their respective participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in DTC will be done in accordance with DTC’s rules and will be
settled in immediately available funds. Transfers between participants in Euroclear and/or Clearstream will
be effected in accordance with Euroclear and Clearstream’s rules and will be settled in immediately available
funds. If a holder of Notes requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason,
including to sell Notes to persons in states which require physical delivery of such securities or to pledge
such securities, such holder of Notes must transfer its interests in the Global Notes in accordance with the
normal procedures of DTC or Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, and in accordance with the
procedures set forth in the Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Notice to Investors.” Book-Entry
Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfer discussed in “Notice to Investors.”

Through and including the 40th day after the later of the commencement of the Offering of the
Notes and the closing of the Offering (the “40-day Period”), beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global
Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the Rule 144A Global
Note denominated in the same currency only if such transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A and the transferor
first delivers to the Trustee a certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such
transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer”
within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in
accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Notice to Investors” and in accordance with all
applicable securities laws of the states of the United States and other jurisdictions.

After the expiration of the 40-day Period, beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Note may
be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global
Note denominated in the same currency without compliance with these certification requirements.

Beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery
in the form of a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Note denominated in the same currency only


-----

upon receipt by the Trustee of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) from the
transferor to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144 under
the Securities Act (if available).

Subject to the foregoing, and as set forth in “Notice to Investors,” Book-Entry Interests may be
transferred and exchanged as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange”. Any
Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form
of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note of the same denomination will, upon transfer, cease to
be a Book-Entry Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other
Global Note, and accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other
procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it retains such a BookEntry Interest.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a
Global Note only as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if required,
only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture)
to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes.
See “Notice to Investors.”

**Information Concerning DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and
Clearstream, as applicable. The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and procedures
solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are
controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither the Issuer, the Trustee, the
Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar nor the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates are
responsible for those operations or procedures.

DTC has advised the Issuer that it is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New
York Banking Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a
member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York
Uniform Commercial Code, and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A
of the U.S. Exchange Act. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity
issues, corporate and municipal debt issues, and money market instruments (that DTC’s direct participants
deposit with DTC). DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among direct participants of sales and
other securities transactions in deposited securities, through electronic computerized book-entry transfers
and pledges between direct participants’ accounts. DTC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Depository
Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company for DTC, National Securities
Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies.
DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to
others such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, and clearing
corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant, either directly
or indirectly.

Like DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also
facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants
through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream
provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement,
lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with
domestic securities markets.

Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities
brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear
and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear
through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and/or Clearstream participant, either directly
or indirectly.

Because DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act
on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to
pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream
systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive
certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery
of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons


-----

may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream
systems will receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global Notes only through DTC, Euroclear
and Clearstream participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be admitted to trading on the Euro
MTF and listed on the official list of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. Transfers of interests in the Global
Notes between participants in DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in
accordance with their respective system’s rules and operating procedures.

Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to
facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream,
as the case may be, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such
procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuer, any Guarantor, the Trustee,
the Registrar, the Transfer Agent or any Paying Agent will have any responsibility for the performance by
DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect participants, of their respective
obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Dollar Global Notes will be made in dollars and initial settlement for the
Euro Global Notes will be made in euro. Book-Entry Interests owned through DTC, Euroclear or
Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional Eurobonds in
registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of DTC, Euroclear
and Clearstream holders on the business day following the settlement date against payment for value on
the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of DTC and Euroclear or Clearstream
and will settle in same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to
establish at the time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s
accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**Special Timing Considerations**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and
other communications involving the Notes through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those
systems are open for business.

In addition, because of time-zone differences, there may be complications with completing
transactions involving Clearstream and/or Euroclear on the same business day as in the United States.
U.S. investors who wish to transfer their interests in the Notes, or to receive or make a payment or delivery
of Notes, on a particular day, may find that the transactions will not be performed until the next business day
in Luxembourg if Clearstream is used, or Brussels if Euroclear is used.

**Trustee’s Powers**

In considering the interests of the holders of the Notes, while title to the Notes is registered in the
name of a nominee of a clearing system, the Trustee may have regard to, and rely on, any information
provided to it by that clearing system as to the identity (either individually or by category) of its account
holders with entitlements to Notes and may consider such interests as if such account holders were the
holders of the Notes.

**Enforcement**

For the purposes of enforcement of the provisions of the Indenture by the Trustee, the persons
named in a certificate of the holder of the Notes in respect of which a Global Note is issued shall be
recognized as the beneficiaries of the trusts set out in the Indenture to the extent of the principal amounts
of their interests in the Notes set out in the certificate of the holder, as if they were themselves the holders of
the Notes in such principal amounts.

**CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

_The following is a description of certain tax considerations relating to a holding of the Notes. It does_
_not purport to be a complete analysis of all tax considerations relating to the Notes. Prospective purchasers of_
_the Notes should consult their tax advisers as to the consequences under the tax laws of the country of which they_
_are resident for tax purposes and the tax laws of any other jurisdiction of acquiring, holding, redeeming and_
_disposing of the Notes and receiving payments and/or other amounts thereunder. This summary is based upon_
_the law as in effect on the date hereof and is subject to any change in law that may take effect after such date, and_
_may be retroactively applicable._

**United Kingdom Tax Considerations**

The following is a general description of certain U.K. tax consequences of acquiring, holding and
disposing of the Notes and is based on the Issuer’s understanding of current U.K. law and HM Revenue &
Customs (“HMRC”) published practice as at the date hereof (which may not be binding on HMRC),
both of which are subject to change, possibly with retrospective effect. This description is not exhaustive
and relates only to the position of persons who are the absolute beneficial owners of the Notes and may not
apply to certain classes of persons, such as brokers, dealers in securities, individuals holding the Notes
through an ISA, persons connected with the Issuer or certain professional investors, to whom special rules
may apply. Further, these comments do not deal with holders of the Notes who are individuals treated as nondomiciled in the United Kingdom for U.K. tax purposes. This description does not purport to constitute
legal or tax advice and any holders who are in any doubt as to their tax position should consult their
independent professional advisors. Any holders (or prospective holders) of the Notes who are subject to tax
in a jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom should consult their independent professional advisors.

**_Interest on the Notes_**

The Notes will constitute “quoted Eurobonds” within the meaning of Section 987 of the Income
Tax Act 2007 (“ITA”) while they carry a right to interest and are and remain listed on a “recognised stock
exchange” within the meaning of Section 1005 of the ITA for the purposes of Section 987 of the ITA, or are
admitted to trading on a “multilateral trading facility” operated by a “regulated recognised stock exchange”
within the meaning of Section 987 of the ITA. While the Notes are, and continue to be, quoted Eurobonds,
payments of interest on the Notes may be made without deduction or withholding for or on account of U.K.
income tax. Securities that have been admitted to the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
and are admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market will meet the requirement to be listed on a recognised
stock exchange. So long as this remains the case with respect to the Notes and the Notes carry a right to
interest, they will therefore constitute quoted Eurobonds.

If the Notes are not, or cease to constitute, “quoted Eurobonds,” an amount may, subject to any
relief available under any applicable double taxation treaty and to the availability of any other relief or
exemption, have to be withheld on account of U.K. income tax from payments of interest on the Notes at
the “basic rate” of U.K. income tax (currently 20%).

If interest were to be paid under deduction of U.K. income tax, holders of the Notes who are not
resident in the United Kingdom for tax purposes may be able to recover all or part of the tax deducted if
there is an appropriate provision in an applicable double taxation treaty.

Where Notes are issued on terms that a premium is or may be payable on redemption then any
such element of premium may constitute a payment of interest for tax purposes and, if so, the provisions
described above relevant to interest will apply.

**_Payments by a Guarantor_**

If a Guarantor which is resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom or which otherwise
makes a payment which is considered to arise in the United Kingdom for the purposes of Part 15 of the
ITA makes any payments in respect of interest on the Notes (or other amounts due under the Notes other
than the repayment of amounts subscribed for the Notes), it is possible that such payments may be subject to
U.K. withholding tax, subject to any claim which could be made under an applicable double taxation
treaty or any other relief or exemption which may apply. Such payments by a Guarantor may not be eligible
for the quoted Eurobond exemption described above.

The references to “interest” and “premium” in the “Interest on the Notes” and “Payments by a
Guarantor” sections above are to “interest” and “premium” as understood for the purposes of U.K. tax


-----

law. They do not take into account any different definitions of “interest” and “premium” that may prevail
under any other tax law or that may apply under the terms and conditions of the Notes or any related
document.

**_Deeply Discounted Securities_**

The Notes may constitute “deeply discounted securities” for the purposes of Chapter 8 of Part 4 of
the UK Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005. Any gain realized on redemption or transfer of
Notes which are “deeply discounted securities” by a holder who is within the charge to UK income tax in
respect of such Notes will generally be taxable as income rather than capital, and such holder will not be able
to claim relief from income tax in respect of any costs incurred on the acquisition, transfer or redemption
of such Notes or on any loss incurred on the transfer or redemption of such Notes.

**_Tax by Direct Assessment_**

Interest on the Notes may constitute U.K. source income for U.K. tax purposes and accordingly
may be chargeable to U.K. income or corporation tax by direct assessment even where paid without
deduction or withholding. However, the interest will not generally be assessed to U.K. tax in the hands of
holders of the Notes who are not resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom, except where the holder
carries on a trade, profession or vocation through a branch or agency (or, in the case of a corporate
holder, a permanent establishment) in the United Kingdom in connection with which the interest is received
or to which the Notes are attributable, in which case (subject to exemptions for interest received by certain
categories of agent) U.K. corporation or income tax may be levied on the U.K. branch, agency or permanent
establishment.

Holders of the Notes may wish to note that the provision referred to in “Description of the Notes—
Payments of Additional Amounts” would not apply if HMRC sought to assess directly the person entitled
to the relevant interest to U.K. tax. However, exemption from, or reduction of, such U.K. tax liability might
be available under an applicable double taxation treaty.

**_United Kingdom Holders Subject to Corporation Tax_**

In general, holders of the Notes who are within the charge to U.K. corporation tax will be charged
to tax on income in respect of all profits, gains and losses on, and fluctuations in value of, the Notes
(whether attributable to currency fluctuations or otherwise) measured and recognized in each accounting
period broadly in accordance with their statutory accounting treatment, calculated in accordance with
generally accepted accounting practice, under the “loan relationships” rules in Part 5 of the Corporation
Tax Act 2009.

**_United Kingdom Holders not Subject to Corporation Tax_**

If the Notes do not constitute “deeply discounted securities” for the purposes of Chapter 8 of
Part 4 of the Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005 as described above, the disposal of the
Notes by an individual holder who is resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom or who carries on a
trade, profession or vocation in the United Kingdom through a branch or agency to which the Notes are
attributable may give rise to a chargeable gain or allowable loss for the purposes of U.K. tax on chargeable
gains, depending on individual circumstances. In calculating any gain or allowable loss on the disposal of the
Notes, sterling values are compared at acquisition and disposal. Accordingly, a taxable gain can arise even
where the euro or dollar amount received on a disposal is less than or the same as the euro or dollar amount
paid for the Notes.

Special rules may apply to individuals who have ceased to be resident for tax purposes in the
United Kingdom and who dispose of their Notes before becoming once again resident in the U.K.
Noteholders are advised to consult their own professional advisors if they require any advice or further
information relating to residency.

On the disposal of Notes by a holder (assuming the Notes do not constitute deeply discounted
securities as described above), any interest which has accrued since the last interest payment date may be
chargeable to tax on income under the rule relating to accrued income profits as set out in Chapter 2 of
Part 12 of the ITA if that holder is resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom or if that holder carries
on a trade, profession or vocation in the United Kingdom through a branch or agency to which the Notes
are attributable.


-----

**_Stamp Duty and Stamp Duty Reserve Tax_**

No U.K. stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax should be payable on the issue of the Notes. No
U.K. stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax should be payable on a transfer of, or an agreement to transfer,
the Notes provided that the Notes do not carry and will not at any time carry (i) a right to interest the amount
of which exceeds a reasonable commercial return on the nominal amount of the capital nor (ii) a right to
interest the amount of which falls to be determined to any extent by reference to the results of, or any part
of, a business or to the value of any property, nor (iii) a right on repayment to an amount which exceeds the
nominal amount of the capital and is not reasonably comparable with what is generally repayable (in
respect of a similar nominal amount of capital) under the terms of issue of loan capital (as that term is
understood for the purposes of Section 79 of the Finance Act 1986) listed in the Official List of the London
Stock Exchange.

**Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following discussion is a summary based on present law of the material U.S. federal income
tax considerations relevant to the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes. This discussion
addresses only U.S. Holders (as defined below) who purchase the Notes in the original issuance at the
“issue price” (generally, the first price at which a substantial amount of the applicable series of Notes is
sold to the public for cash), hold the Notes as capital assets and use the U.S. dollar as their functional
currency. This summary does not address the tax consequences to subsequent purchasers of the Notes.

This discussion is not a complete description of all U.S. federal income tax considerations relating
to the Notes. It does not address the tax treatment of prospective purchasers subject to special rules, such
as banks, dealers, traders that elect to mark to market, insurance companies, real estate investment trusts,
regulated investment companies, grantor trusts, investors liable for the alternative minimum tax, U.S.
expatriates, accrual method taxpayers who are required to recognize income for U.S. federal income tax
purposes no later than when such income is taken into account for financial accounting purposes, tax-exempt
entities or persons holding the Notes as part of a hedge, straddle, conversion or other integrated financial
transaction. This summary does not discuss any tax consequences arising under U.S. federal estate and gift
tax laws or the laws of any state, local, non-U.S. or other taxing jurisdiction.

**YOU ARE URGED TO CONSULT YOUR OWN TAX ADVISOR ABOUT THE U.S. FEDERAL,**
**STATE AND LOCAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES TO YOU OF PURCHASING, HOLDING**
**AND DISPOSING OF THE NOTES, AS WELL AS THE CONSEQUENCES TO YOU ARISING**
**UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY OTHER TAXING JURISDICTION OR DUE TO CHANGES IN TAX**
**LAW.**

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner that is, for purposes of U.S.
federal income taxation, (i) a citizen or resident alien of the United States, (ii) a corporation (or other entity
treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of
the United States or its political subdivisions, (iii) a trust that (a) is subject to the primary supervision of a
court within the United States and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial
decisions of the trust or (b) has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be
treated as a U.S. person or (iv) an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation
regardless of its source.

If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes acquires
or holds the Notes, the tax treatment of a partner generally will depend upon the status of the partner and
the activities of the partnership. A partner or partnership that acquires or holds the Notes should consult its
own tax advisors. Additionally, a U.S. Holder who purchases Notes pursuant to this Offering and
participates in the Tender Offers should consult its tax advisor as to whether the treatment of the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the Notes would be different from that described below.

This summary is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), U.S.
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, rulings and judicial decisions all as of the date hereof, which
are subject to change (possibly with retroactive effect), so as to result in U.S. federal income tax
consequences different from those summarized below. No rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service
(“IRS”) have been or will be sought with respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance
that the IRS will not take a different position concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership
or disposition of the Notes and that any such position would not be sustained.


-----

**_Characterization of the Notes_**

In certain circumstances, we may be required to pay amounts on the Notes in addition to stated
principal and interest (e.g., in the circumstances described under “Description of the Notes—Payment of
Additional Amounts,” “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption” and “Description of the Notes—
Purchase of Notes upon a Change of Control”). These potential payments may implicate the provisions of
the U.S. Treasury Regulations relating to “contingent payment debt instruments.” One or more contingencies
will not cause the Notes to be treated as contingent payment debt instruments if, as of the Issue Date,
such contingencies, in the aggregate, are considered remote or incidental. Although the issue is not free from
doubt, we intend to take the position that the possibility of such additional payments does not result in
the Notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations.
This position will be based on our determination that, as of the Issue Date, the possibility that additional
payments will be made is, in the aggregate, a remote or incidental contingency within the meaning of applicable
U.S. Treasury Regulations. Assuming such position is respected, a U.S. Holder would be required to
include in income the amount of any such additional payments at the time such payments are received or
accrued in accordance with such U.S. Holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Our determination that these contingencies are remote or incidental is binding on a holder, unless
such holder explicitly discloses to the IRS on its tax return for the year during which it acquires the Notes
that it is taking a different position. However, our position is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS takes a
contrary position to that described above, then the Notes may be treated as contingent payment debt
instruments. In that case, regardless of a holder’s regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, a holder subject to U.S. federal income taxation may be required to accrue ordinary interest
income on the Notes at a rate in excess of their stated interest, and to treat any gain realized on the sale,
redemption or other taxable disposition of the Notes as ordinary income rather than capital gain. You are
urged to consult your own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the Notes being treated as
contingent payment debt instruments. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Notes will not be
treated as contingent payment debt instruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**_Stated Interest_**

Stated interest paid on the Notes generally will be taxable to you as ordinary income at the time
the interest accrues or is received, in accordance with your regular method of accounting for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. Interest generally will be income from sources outside the United States and, for
purposes of the U.S. foreign tax credit, generally will be considered “passive category income”.

If you use the cash basis method of accounting and you receive stated interest payments in euro, as
you would as a holder of any Euro Notes, you will be required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of
the amount received, determined by translating the euros received at the “spot rate” in effect on the date
of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. You will not recognize
exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such payment of stated interest, but may recognize
exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the euro so received.

If you use the accrual method of accounting and you receive stated interest payments in euro, you
may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to such interest in accordance with either of
two methods. Under the first method, you will be required to include in income for each taxable year the U.S.
dollar value of the stated interest that has accrued during such year, determined by translating such
interest at the average rate of exchange for the period during which such interest accrued, or, in the case of
an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average rate for the partial period within your taxable
year. Under the second method, you may elect to translate stated interest income at the spot rate on (i) the
last day of the accrual period, (ii) the last day of the taxable year if the accrual period straddles your taxable
year or (iii) the date the stated interest payment is received if such date is within five days of the end of the
accrual period. Such election must be applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and
cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. In addition, upon receipt of a stated interest payment
in euros (including amounts received upon the sale, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note
attributable to accrued interest previously included in income), you will recognize exchange gain or loss,
generally treated as U.S. source ordinary income or loss (and not as an adjustment to interest income or
expense), in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of such payment
(determined by translating the euros received at the spot rate in effect on the date of receipt) and the U.S.
dollar value of the stated interest income that you previously included in income with respect to such payment,
regardless of whether the payment is actually converted into U.S. dollars.


-----

**_Disposition_**

You generally will recognize gain or loss on a sale, redemption or other taxable disposition of a
Note in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized (less any accrued but unpaid stated
interest, which if not previously included in income is taxed as interest income) and your adjusted tax
basis in the Note. Your adjusted tax basis in a Note generally will be the U.S. dollar cost for the Note,
decreased by any payments on the Note other than stated interest previously received. If you purchased a
Note with euros, your cost generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the euros paid for such Note determined
at the spot rate on the date of such purchase (or on the settlement date of the purchase, in the case of an
electing accrual basis taxpayer if the Note is traded on an established securities market or a cash basis
taxpayer). If your Note is sold, redeemed or otherwise disposed of in a taxable transaction for euros, then
your amount realized generally will be the U.S. dollar value of any euros received based on the spot rate
in effect on the date of such sale, redemption or other taxable disposition (or on the settlement date of the
sale or other disposition, in the case of an electing accrual basis taxpayer if the Note is traded on an established
securities market or a cash basis taxpayer). If you use the accrual method of accounting and have not
elected to translate euro amounts at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date, upon receipt of a
payment in euros, you may recognize exchange gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss) equal to the
difference (if any) between the U.S. dollar value of the amount received based on the spot rate in effect on
the date of sale, redemption or other taxable disposition and spot rate in effect on the settlement date.

Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, your gain or loss on disposition of a Note
generally will be U.S. source capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if you have held
the Note for more than one year at the time of disposition. A non-corporate U.S. Holder generally will be
eligible for reduced rates of taxation on any long-term capital gain recognized. Deductions for capital losses
are subject to limitations.

If you hold a Euro Note, a portion of your gain or loss may be treated as exchange gain or loss.
Such exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss and generally will be U.S. source gain
or loss. For these purposes, the principal amount of the Notes is your purchase price for the Note in
euros on the date of purchase, and the amount of exchange gain or loss recognized is equal to the difference
between the (i) U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined on the date of the sale, redemption
or other taxable disposition of the Note (or on the settlement date, if you are an electing accrual basis
taxpayer and the Note is traded on an established securities market or if you are a cash basis taxpayer) and
(ii) U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined on the date you purchased the Note. The amount
of exchange gain or loss with respect to the principal and with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest,
will be limited to the amount of overall gain or loss realized on the disposition of the Note. In certain
circumstances, U.S. Treasury Regulations require foreign exchange losses in excess of a threshold amount
to be reported to the IRS. If you hold a Euro Note, you should consult your tax advisors to determine the tax
return obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the Note, including any requirement to file IRS
Form 8886.

**_Exchange of Foreign Currency_**

On a sale, redemption or other taxable disposition of foreign currency, you generally will recognize
gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between (i) the amount of U.S. dollars, or the fair market
value in U.S. dollars of other property, received by you in the disposition and (ii) your tax basis in the foreign
currency. Any such gain or loss will be U.S. source ordinary income or loss and will not be treated as
interest income or expense, except to the extent provided by administrative pronouncements of the IRS.
Foreign currency received as interest on a Note or on the sale, redemption or other taxable disposition of a
Note will have a tax basis equal to its U.S. dollar value at the time the foreign currency is received (including
foreign currency received from the sale, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note that is traded on
an established securities market in the case of an accrual basis taxpayer that does not make the election
described above, once exchange gain or loss, if any, has been realized for the period between the trade date
and the settlement date, as described above). Foreign currency that is purchased will generally have a tax basis
equal to the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency on the date of purchase.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

Payments of interest and proceeds from the sale, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note
may be subject to U.S. information reporting to the IRS unless you establish a basis for exemption. Backup
withholding may apply to amounts subject to reporting if you fail to provide an accurate taxpayer
identification number and otherwise comply with applicable backup withholding rules. Backup withholding


-----

is not an additional tax. You generally can claim a credit against your U.S. federal income tax liability for
the amount of any backup withholding and a refund of any excess, provided that the required information
is timely furnished to the IRS.

**_Information with Respect to Foreign Financial Assets_**

Individuals that own “specified foreign financial assets” with an aggregate value in excess of
$50,000 on the last day of the tax year or $75,000 at any time during the tax year are generally required to
file information reports with respect to such assets with their U.S. federal income tax returns. Depending on
the individual’s circumstances, higher threshold amounts may apply. “Specified foreign financial assets”
include any financial accounts maintained by foreign financial institutions, as well as any of the following,
but only if they are not held in accounts maintained by financial institutions: (i) stocks and securities issued
by non-U.S. persons, (ii) financial instruments and contracts held for investment that have non-U.S.
issuers or counterparties and (iii) interests in non-U.S. entities. The Notes may be treated as specified
foreign financial assets. You may be subject to this information reporting regime and required to file IRS
Form 8938 listing these assets with your U.S. federal income tax return. Failure to file information reports
may subject you to penalties. You are urged to consult your own tax advisor regarding your obligations to file
information reports with respect to the Notes.

**_Additional Tax on Net Investment Income_**

The “net investment income” (or undistributed “net investment income,” in the case of a trust or
estate) of certain U.S. Holders that are individuals, trusts or estates and that have modified adjusted gross
income (or adjusted gross income, in the case of a trust or estate) above a certain threshold (which in the case
of an individual is between $125,000 and $250,000, depending on the individual’s circumstances) is subject
to a 3.8% tax, in addition to otherwise applicable U.S. federal income tax. A U.S. Holder’s “net investment
income” generally includes, among other things, interest income on and capital gain from the disposition
of securities like the Notes, subject to certain exceptions. If you are a U.S. Holder that is an individual, estate
or trust, you are urged to consult your own tax advisor regarding the applicability of this tax to your
investment in the Notes.

**_Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act_**

Pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (provisions commonly known as “FATCA”)
and subject to the proposed regulations discussed below, a “foreign financial institution” may be required to
withhold U.S. tax on certain “foreign passthru payments” made after December 31, 2018 to the extent
such payments are treated as attributable to certain U.S. source payments. Obligations issued on or prior to
the date that is six months after applicable final regulations defining foreign passthru payments are
published in the Federal Register generally would be “grandfathered” unless materially modified after such
date. Accordingly, if the Issuer is treated as a foreign financial institution, FATCA could apply to payments
on the Notes only if there is a significant modification of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes
after the expiration of this grandfathering period. Under proposed regulations, any withholding on foreign
passthru payments on the Notes that are not otherwise grandfathered would apply to passthru payments
made on or after the date that is two years after the date of publication in the Federal Register of applicable
final regulations defining foreign passthru payments. Taxpayers generally may rely on these proposed
regulations until final regulations are issued. Non-U.S. governments have entered into agreements with the
United States (and additional non-U.S. governments are expected to enter into such agreements) to implement
FATCA in a manner that alters the rules described herein. Holders should consult their own tax advisors
on how these rules may apply to their investment in the Notes. In the event any withholding under FATCA
is imposed with respect to any payments on the Notes, there will be no additional amounts payable to
compensate for the withheld amount.

**The above description is not intended to constitute a complete analysis of all tax consequences**
**relating to the ownership of the Notes. Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their own tax**
**advisors concerning the tax consequences of their particular situations.**

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS**

You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or other transfer
of any of the Notes offered hereby.

The Notes and the guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act, or
the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold except
pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the
Securities Act and applicable securities laws in any other jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Notes offered hereby
are being offered and sold only to qualified institutional buyers (as defined in Rule 144A under the
Securities Act) in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to non-U.S. persons in offshore
transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act (and only to investors who: (a) if resident
in a Member State of the EEA, are not retail investors, defined as a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail
client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning of the
Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined
in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II); or not a “qualified investor” as defined in the EU Prospectus
Regulation; or (b) if resident in the United Kingdom, are not retail investors, defined as a person who is
one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it
forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions
of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97,
where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of
Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified
investor as defined in Article 2 of the UK Prospectus Regulation.

We have not registered and will not register the Notes or the guarantees under the Securities Act
and, therefore, the Notes may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or
benefit of, U.S. persons except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the
registration requirements of the Securities Act. Accordingly, the Issuer is offering and selling the Notes to the
Initial Purchasers for re-offer and resale only:

     - in the United States to “qualified institutional buyers,” commonly referred to as “QIBs,” as
defined in Rule 144A in compliance with Rule 144A; and

    - outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in accordance with Regulation S.

We use the terms “offshore transaction,” “U.S. person” and “United States” with the meanings
given to them in Regulation S.

Each purchaser of the Notes, by its acceptance thereof, will be deemed to have acknowledged,
represented to and agreed with the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers as follows:

(1) You understand and acknowledge that the Notes and the guarantees have not been
registered under the Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws and that the
Notes are being offered for resale in transactions not requiring registration under the
Securities Act or any other securities laws, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A under the
Securities Act, and, unless so registered, may not be offered, sold or otherwise transferred
except in compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act or any
other applicable securities laws, pursuant to an exemption therefrom or in any transaction
not subject thereto and in each case in compliance with the conditions for transfer set
forth in paragraphs (5) and (6) below.

(2) You are not our “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act) or acting on
our behalf and you are either:

(a) a QIB, within the meaning of Rule 144A under the Securities Act and are aware
that any sale of these Notes to you will be made in reliance on Rule 144A under the
Securities Act, and such acquisition will be for your own account or for the
account of another QIB; or

(b) a non-U.S. person and you are purchasing the Notes in an offshore transaction in
accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act and, if you are an
investor resident in a Member State of the EEA or the United Kingdom, you are
a qualified investor (within the meaning of Article 2(e) of the EU Prospectus
Regulation and any relevant implementing measure in each Member State of the
EEA or the UK Prospectus Regulation, respectively.


-----

You acknowledge that neither the Initial Purchasers nor any person representing the Initial

only (i) to the Issuer, (ii) pursuant to a registration statement that has been declared effective

being made in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act, (iv) to non-U.S. persons
pursuant to offers and sales that occur outside the United States in compliance with
Regulation S under the Securities Act or (v) pursuant to any other available exemption
from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, subject in each of the foregoing
cases to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the property of such
investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and to compliance

further subject to the Issuer’s and the Trustee’s rights prior to any such offer, sale or
transfer (I) pursuant to clauses (iv) and (v) to require the delivery of an opinion of counsel,
certification or other information satisfactory to each of them and (II) in each of the
foregoing cases, to require that a certificate of transfer in the form appearing on the reverse

(b) If resident in the United Kingdom, you represent that you are not a retail investor. For

**ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase and holding of
the Notes by any purchaser, including, without limitation, any fiduciary purchasing on behalf of (i) an
employee benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,
as amended (“ERISA”)) subject to the provisions of Part 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or a plan,
individual retirement account or other arrangement to which Section 4975 of the Code applies (each, an
“ERISA Plan”), (ii) an entity whose underlying assets include “plan assets” with respect to an ERISA Plan
by reason of an ERISA Plan’s investment in such entity or otherwise (each, a “Benefit Plan Investor”) or
(iii) a “governmental plan”(as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), a “church plan”(as defined in Section 3(33)
of ERISA or Section 4975(g)(3) of the Code) or a non-U.S. plan (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of
ERISA) or other arrangement that is subject to any Federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other laws or regulations
that are substantially similar to the fiduciary responsibility or prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA
or the provisions of Section 4975 of the Code (“Similar Laws”) (together with ERISA Plan, “Plans”).

**General Fiduciary Matters**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of an ERISA Plan and
prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested
parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the
administration of an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of an ERISA Plan, or
who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation with respect to the assets of an ERISA Plan,
is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan.

In considering an investment in the Notes, a Plan fiduciary should determine whether the investment
is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of
ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation,
the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the
Code and any other applicable Similar Laws.

Each ERISA Plan should consider the fact that none of the Issuer, the guarantors, the Initial
Purchasers, the Trustee or any of their respective affiliates (the “Transaction Parties”) is acting as a
fiduciary to any ERISA Plan with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes. The Transaction
Parties are not undertaking to provide impartial investment advice or advice based on any particular
investment need, or to give advice in a fiduciary capacity, with respect to the decision to purchase or hold
the Notes. All communications, correspondence and materials from the Transaction Parties with respect to
the Notes are intended to be general in nature and are not directed at any specific purchaser of the Notes, and
do not constitute advice regarding the advisability of investment in the Notes for any specific purchaser.
The decision to purchase and hold the Notes must be made solely by each prospective ERISA Plan purchaser
on an arm’s length basis.

**Prohibited Transaction Issues**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in
specified transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the
meaning of Section 3(14) of ERISA, or “disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of
the Code, unless a statutory or administrative exemption is available.

A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may
be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the
fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engages in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to
penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. The acquisition, holding and/or disposition of Notes by
an ERISA Plan with respect to which a Transaction Party is considered a party in interest or disqualified
person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA
and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable
statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, certain exemptions from the
prohibited transaction rules could be applicable to the purchase and holding of notes by a Plan, depending on
the type and circumstances of the fiduciary making the decision to acquire such notes and the relationship
of the party in interest or disqualified person to the Plan. Included among these exemptions are
Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code for certain transactions between a Plan
and non-fiduciary service providers to the Plan. In addition, the United States Department of Labor has
issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may apply to the acquisition and holding
of the notes. These class exemptions (as may be amended from time to time) include, without limitation,


-----

PTCE 84-14 (respecting transactions effected by independent “qualified professional asset managers”),
PTCE 90-1 (respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts), PTCE 91-38 (respecting bank collective
investment funds), PTCE 95-60 (respecting insurance company general accounts) and PTCE 96-23
(respecting transactions directed by in-house asset managers).

Each of these PTCEs contains conditions and limitations on its application. Thus, the fiduciaries
of a Plan that is considering acquiring and/or holding the Notes in reliance of any of these, or any other,
PTCEs should carefully review the conditions and limitations of the PTCE and consult with their counsel to
confirm that it is applicable. There can be no, and we do not provide any, assurance that any PTCE or any
other exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving the Notes.

Because of the foregoing, the Notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing “plan
assets” of any Plan, unless such acquisition, holding and subsequent disposition will not constitute a nonexempt prohibited transaction under ERISA and the Code or similar violation of any applicable Similar
Laws.

**Representation**

The transferee or holder of the Notes will be deemed to have represented, agreed and acknowledged
(as applicable) in its corporate and fiduciary capacity, that:

(a) With respect to the acquisition, holding and disposition of the Notes, or any interest therein,
(1) either (A) it is not, and it is not acting directly or indirectly on behalf of (and for so long as it holds such
Notes or any interest therein will not be, and will not be acting directly or indirectly on behalf of), a Plan,
a Benefit Plan Investor, or a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan or other arrangement that is subject to
Similar Laws, and no part of the assets used or to be used by it to acquire or hold such Notes or any
interest therein constitutes the assets of any such Plan, Benefit Plan Investor or governmental, church or
non-U.S. plan or other arrangement that is subject to Similar Laws, or (B) (i) its acquisition, holding and
disposition of such Notes or any interest therein does not and will not constitute or otherwise result in a nonexempt prohibited transaction under Part 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the
Code, as applicable (or, in the case of a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan or other arrangement, a
violation of any applicable Similar Laws); and (ii) none of the Transaction Parties is a sponsor of, or a
fiduciary (within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA or, with respect to a governmental, church or
non-U.S. plan or other arrangement, any definition of “fiduciary,”or any substantially similar concept, under
any applicable Similar Laws) with respect to the purchaser, transferee or holder in connection with any
acquisition, holding or disposition of such Notes, or as a result of any exercise by the Issuer or any of its
affiliates of any rights in connection with such Notes, and no advice provided by the Issuer or any of their
affiliates has formed a primary basis for any investment or other decision by or on behalf of the purchaser,
transferee or holder in connection with such Notes and the transactions contemplated with respect to
such Notes; and (2) it will not sell or otherwise transfer such Notes or any interest therein other than to a
purchaser or transferee that is deemed (or if required by the applicable indenture, certified) to make these
same representations, warranties and agreements with respect to its acquisition, holding and disposition of
such Notes or any interest therein.

(b) The acquirer and any fiduciary causing it to acquire an interest in any Notes agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless the Issuer, the guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee and their
respective affiliates, from and against any cost, damage or loss incurred by any of them as a result of any of
the foregoing representations and agreements being or becoming false.

(c) Any purported acquisition or transfer of any Note or beneficial interest therein to a purchaser
or transferee that does not comply with the requirements of the above provisions shall be void ab initio.


-----

The foregoing discussion is necessarily general in nature, is not intended to be all-inclusive, and
should not be construed as legal advice or a legal opinion. Further, no assurance can be given that future
legislation, administrative rulings, court decisions or regulatory action will not modify the conclusions set
forth in this discussion. Any such changes may be retroactive and thereby apply to transactions entered into
prior to the date of their enactment or release. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that
may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important
that fiduciaries or other persons considering purchasing the Notes (and holding the Notes) on behalf of, or
with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA,
Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such transactions and whether an exemption would be
applicable to the purchase and holding of the Notes. The sale of a Note to a Plan is in no respect a
representation by any Transaction Party or any of their respective representatives that such an investment
meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by any such Plan or that such investment is
appropriate for any such Plan.

(1) Sales may be made through affiliates of the Initial Purchasers listed above.

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreements, the applicable Initial
Purchasers have agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase all of the Notes sold under the applicable
Purchase Agreement if any of the Notes are purchased. If an Initial Purchaser defaults, each Purchase
Agreement provides that the purchase commitments of the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers may be increased
or such Purchase Agreement may be terminated. The Initial Purchasers may make offers and sales into the
United States through U.S. broker-dealers.

We have agreed to indemnify the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities
under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in
respect of those liabilities.

The Initial Purchasers are offering the Notes, subject to prior sale, when, as and if issued to and
accepted by them, subject to approval of legal matters by their counsel, including the validity of the Notes
and other conditions contained in the Purchase Agreements, such as the receipt by the Initial Purchasers of
officer’s certificates and legal opinions. The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or


-----

modify offers to investors and to reject orders in whole or in part. Landesbank Hessen-Thüringen
Girozentrale is a non-U.S. bank or dealer that is not registered as a broker-dealer under Section 15 of the
Securities Act, and therefore agrees that, while acting as an Initial Purchaser in respect of the Securities and
in any event during the term of the Purchase Agreement, it will not, directly or indirectly, make use of any
U.S. mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to effect transactions in, or induce or
attempt to induce the purchase or sale of any Securities except for transactions in compliance with
Rule 15a-6 under the Securities Act or as otherwise permitted by Section 15 of the Securities Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder.

**Offer Price**

The Initial Purchasers propose initially to offer the Notes at the respective offering prices set forth
on the cover page of this offering memorandum. After the initial offering of the Notes, the offering prices
and other selling terms of the Notes may from time to time be varied by the Initial Purchasers without notice.
The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell the Notes through certain of their affiliates. Certain Initial
Purchasers are not broker-dealers registered with the SEC and, therefore, may not make sales of any Notes
in the United States or to U.S. persons except in compliance with applicable U.S. laws and regulations. To the
extent that any Initial Purchasers that are not U.S. registered broker dealers intend to effect any sales of
the Notes in the United States, they will only do so through one or more U.S. registered broker dealers
affiliates as permitted by Financial Industry Regulatory Authority guidelines.

**Notes Are Not Being Registered**

The Notes and the guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act
and may not be offered or sold within the United States except to qualified institutional buyers in reliance
on Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to persons who are not U.S. persons (as defined in Regulation S
under the Securities Act) in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. In
addition, until 40 days following the later of (i) the commencement of the Offering and (ii) the issue date of
the Notes, an offer or sale of the Notes initially sold in reliance on Regulation S within the United States
by a dealer (whether or not participating in the Offering) may violate the registration requirements of the
Securities Act unless the dealer makes the offer or sale in compliance with Rule 144A or another exemption
from registration under the Securities Act. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them
by Regulation S under the Securities Act. Each purchaser of the Notes will be deemed to have made
acknowledgments, representations and agreements as described under “Notice to Investors.”

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom,
by us or the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the
possession, circulation or distribution of this offering memorandum or any other material relating to us or
the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be
offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this offering memorandum nor any other offering
material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any
country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country
or jurisdiction. This offering memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer
to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose
possession this offering memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any
restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of this offering memorandum and resale of the Notes.
See “Notice to Investors.”

The Issuer and the Guarantors have agreed that they will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell,
pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer,
sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities
Act or the safe harbor of Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act to cease to be applicable to the
offer and sale of the Notes.

**New Issue of Securities**

The Euro Notes and the Dollar Notes are new issues of securities with no established trading
market. We do not intend to apply for listing of the Euro Notes and Dollar Notes on any U.S. securities
exchange or for inclusion of such Notes on any automated dealer quotation system. We have been advised
by certain of the Initial Purchasers that they presently intend to make a market in the Notes after completion
of the Offering. However, they are under no obligation to do so and may discontinue any market making
activities at any time without any notice. We cannot assure the liquidity of the trading market for the Notes.
If an active trading market for the Notes does not develop, the market price and liquidity of the Notes
may be adversely affected. If the Notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering
price, depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our operating performance and
financial condition, general economic conditions and other factors. There may not be an active trading
market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell your Notes may be limited. See “Risk Factors—
Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Capital Structure—Lack of public market—There may not be an active
trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell your Notes may be limited.”

We will apply to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and trade
the Notes on the Euro MTF Market, however, we cannot assure you that the Notes will be approved for
listing or that such listing will be maintained.

**Settlement**

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made to investors on or about the date specified in the
last paragraph of the cover page of this offering memorandum, which will be U.S. business days (as
such term is used for purposes of Rule 15(c)6-1 under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the “Exchange Act”)) following the date of this offering memorandum (such settlement being
referred to as “T+ ”). Under Rule 15(c)6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market
are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise.
Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing or the next succeeding U.S.
business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially settle in T+, to specify an
alternate settlement arrangement at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers
of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors.

**No Sales of Similar Securities**

We have agreed that we will not, for a period of 60 days after the date of this offering memorandum,
without the prior written consent of the Representatives, directly or indirectly, pledge, issue, sell, offer to
sell, grant any option for the sale of, or otherwise dispose of any of our other debt securities having a maturity
of more than one year from the date of issue, except for debt securities (A) issued or guaranteed in
accordance with, or as permitted under, the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement, (B) issued or guaranteed
in connection with the sales of receivables pursuant to securitization or factoring arrangements or issuances
of debt securities pursuant to sales of such receivables, or the implementation of any receivables
securitization or factoring facility or (C) issued or guaranteed in immaterial amounts in the ordinary course
of business.

**Price Stabilization and Short Positions**

In connection with the Offering, the Initial Purchasers (or persons acting on their behalf) may
engage in transactions that stabilize the market price of the Notes. Such transactions consist of bids or
purchases to peg, fix or maintain the price of the Notes. Purchases of a security to stabilize the price or to
reduce a short position may cause the price of the security to be higher than it might be in the absence of such
purchases.

In connection with the Offering, the Initial Purchasers may purchase and sell the Notes in the open
market. These transactions may include short sales and purchases on the open market to cover positions
created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the Initial Purchasers of a greater principal amount of
the Notes than they are required to purchase in the Offering. The Initial Purchasers must close out any
short position by purchasing the Notes in the open market. A short position is more likely to be created if
the Initial Purchasers are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the Notes in the
open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the Offering.


-----

Similar to other purchase transactions, the Initial Purchasers’ purchases to cover the syndicate
short sales may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of the Notes or preventing or
retarding a decline in the market price of the Notes. As a result, the price of the Notes may be higher than
the price that might otherwise exist in the open market.

Neither we nor any of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates make any representation or prediction
as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price
of the Notes. In addition, neither we nor any of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates make any
representation that the representatives will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once
commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.

Any stabilizing action, if commenced, must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the Issue
Date and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the
Notes and Our Capital Structure—Lack of public market—There may not be an active trading market for
the Notes, in which case your ability to sell your Notes may be limited.”

**Other Relationships**

The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various
activities, which may include securities trading, commercial investment banking, financial advising,
investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The Initial
Purchasers or their respective affiliates have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, investment banking,
financial advisory, consulting, commercial banking and other commercial dealings (including, e.g., the
provision of financing in various forms, securitization programs, cash management, trade finance, hedging
and other banking services) in the ordinary course of business with us, our principal shareholders or our
affiliates, including assistance with open-market repurchasing. Some of the Initial Purchasers have also
assisted with ESG ratings advisory and/or facilitated the Group in seeking ESG ratings. They have received,
and expect to receive, customary fees, commissions and expense reimbursements for these transactions.
Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates may from time to time also enter into swap and
other derivative transactions with us, our principal shareholders or our affiliates. In addition, in the
ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a
broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and
financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers.
Such investments and trading activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Group or the
Group’s affiliates, including the Existing Notes.

If the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with the Issuer or its affiliates,
certain of those Initial Purchasers or their affiliates routinely hedge, and certain of those initial purchasers
or their affiliates may hedge, their credit exposure to the Issuer and/or its affiliates consistent with their
customary risk management policies. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates have a lending
relationship with the Group, including under the Senior Secured Term Loans and notes issued by the Group
or certain affiliates of the Group, and routinely hedge their credit exposure to the Group consistent with
their customary risk management policies. Typically, such Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge
such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or
the creation of short positions in securities, including potentially the Notes. Any such short positions could
adversely affect future trading prices of Notes. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also publish
or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or
recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates may receive allocations of the Notes and may be
lenders under the New Senior Secured Term Loans. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates, have
in the past acted as joint global coordinator, joint lead arranger and/or joint bookrunner in relation to the
Senior Secured Term Loans, a portion of which will be repaid with the net proceeds of the Offering. Certain
Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates also provide loans to certain affiliates of the Group and act
as arrangers, bookrunners, technical bank and/or agents under loan facilities of certain affiliates of the
Group. Certain Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates are lenders under the Securitization Program
and may also provide cash management, foreign currency exchange instruments and hedging services to
the Group or affiliates of the Group.

Affiliates of INEOS Limited may purchase Notes issued on the Issue Date.

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS**

The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are companies incorporated in England and Wales.
Other Guarantors are organized under the laws of Belgium, Germany, Jersey, Luxembourg, Norway,
Singapore, Switzerland and the United States, and future Guarantors may also be organized under the laws
of non-U.S. jurisdictions. All of our directors and executive officers and many of the directors and
officers of the Guarantors are non-residents of the United States. Although the Issuer and each of the
Guarantors have submitted to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action
under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on our
directors and executive officers and the directors and executive officers of the Guarantors or security
providers. In addition, as many of our and the Guarantors’ assets and the assets of our and their directors
and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce against them or
us judgments obtained in U.S. courts predicated on civil liability provisions of the Federal securities laws
of the United States.

If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against us or a Guarantor, investors will need to enforce
such judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant company has assets. Even though the enforceability of
U.S. court judgments outside the United States is described below for the countries in which any of our
Guarantors or our Collateral is located, you should consult with your own advisors in any pertinent
jurisdictions as needed to enforce a judgment in those countries or elsewhere outside the United States.

**Belgium**

The U.S. and Belgium do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement
of court judgments in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, the enforcement in Belgium of a judgment
obtained in any U.S. Federal or State court will be subject to Belgian rules of civil procedure and will only be
granted following formal ‘exequatur’ proceedings before a Belgian court in accordance with Articles 23
and 24 of the Belgian Code of Private International Law (Wetboek van Internationaal Privaatrecht/Code de
_droit international privé)._

Pursuant to Article 24 of the Belgian Code of Private International Law, the following documents
must be produced in court by the claimant seeking enforcement:

     - an official copy of the judgment (uitgifte van de beslissing/expédition de la décision) fulfilling all
conditions required for its authentication under the applicable foreign law;

    - if obtained by default, an original or legalized copy of the document demonstrating that the
originating process has been served on the defendant in accordance with the applicable foreign
law; and

    - any document demonstrating that, under the applicable foreign law, the judgment is enforceable
and has been notified to the defendant.

However, the court will refuse enforcement in the circumstances described in Article 25 of the
Belgian Code of Private International Law and notably, if, among other things:

    - the consequences of the enforcement of the judgment would be manifestly contrary to Belgian
public policy;

     - the rights of defense were not respected;

     - the jurisdiction of the foreign judge was based solely on the presence of the defendant or assets
in such state without any further connection with the litigation in such state;

    - without prejudice to Article 23.4 of the Belgian Code of Private International Law, the judgment
is not final or does not meet the requirements of authenticity pursuant to the laws of the State
where the judgment was rendered or the applicable federal rules;

     - if in relation to matters for which parties cannot freely dispose of their rights, the decision has
been sought with the sole purpose of escaping from the application of the laws applicable in
accordance with Belgian conflict of law rules;

     - the decision is in conflict with either a decision rendered in Belgium or a decision previously
rendered in another state that can be recognized in Belgium;

     - the claim was introduced before the courts of such state after a claim, which is still pending and
relating to the same matter and between the same parties, was introduced in a Belgian court;


-----

     - the Belgian courts have exclusive jurisdiction in relation to the claim; or

     - the decision is in conflict with the rules on the recognition and enforcement of court decisions in
relation to insolvency proceedings.

With regard to the enforcement by legal proceedings of any claim (including the exequatur of
foreign court decisions in Belgium), a registration tax of 3% (to be calculated on the total amount, which a
debtor is ordered to pay) is due, if the sum of money which the debtor is ordered to pay by a Belgian court
judgment, or by a foreign court judgment that is either (i) automatically enforceable and registered in
Belgium or (ii) rendered enforceable by a Belgian court, exceeds EUR 12,500. The debtors are liable for the
payment of the registration tax, in the proportion determined by the decision ordering payment or
liquidation or determining priority for creditors made or established against them. The debtors are jointly
and severally liable in the event that they are ordered to pay jointly and severally.

**Canada**

The following discussion with respect to the enforceability of certain United States court judgments
in the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Nova Scotia and Ontario (individually a “Canadian Province” and
collectively the “Canadian Provinces”) is based upon advice provided to us by U.S. and Canadian counsel.

    - None of the Canadian Provinces currently have a treaty with the United States of America or
any state thereof providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as
opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment
rendered by any federal or state court in the United States, whether predicated solely upon
U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in the Canadian
Provinces. However, under the laws of the Canadian Provinces and the federal laws of Canada
applicable therein, a court of competent jurisdiction in the Canadian Provinces (a “Canadian
**Court”) would permit an action to be brought in such Canadian Court on a final, conclusive and**
subsisting in personam judgment of a court exercising competent jurisdiction in the U.S. (a
“U.S. Court”) for a sum certain, obtained against the Issuer or the Guarantors (a “U.S. Judgment”),
without reconsideration of the merits, provided that: the U.S. Court rendering such judgment
had jurisdiction over the Issuer or the relevant Canadian Guarantor, as recognized by the Canadian
Court (and submission by the Issuer or the relevant Canadian Guarantor to the non-exclusive
jurisdiction of the U.S. Court would be sufficient for that purpose);

    - an action to enforce the U.S. judgment must be commenced in the Canadian Court within any
applicable limitation period;

    - the Canadian Court has discretion to stay or decline to hear an action on the U.S. Judgment if
the U.S. Judgment is under appeal or there is another subsisting judgment in any jurisdiction
relating to the same cause of action as the U.S. Judgment;

    - under the Currency Act (Canada), the Canadian Court may only render judgment for a sum of
money in Canadian currency, and in enforcing a foreign judgment for a sum of money in a foreign
currency, the CanadianCourt will render its decision in the Canadian currency equivalent of
such foreign currency;

    - an action in the Canadian Court on the U.S. Judgment may be affected by bankruptcy, insolvency
or laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally; and

such enforcement would be subject to the following defenses:

    - the U.S. Judgment was obtained by fraud or in a manner contrary to the principles of natural
justice, provided that the U.S. Judgment would not be contrary to natural justice by reason only
that service of process was effected on the agent for service of process appointed by the Issuer or
the relevant Canadian Guarantor;

    - the U.S. Judgment is for a claim which under applicable Canadian law would be characterized as
based on a foreign revenue, expropriatory, penal or other public law;

     - the U.S. Judgment is contrary to public policy of the relevant Canadian Province, as applicable,
or to an order made by the Attorney General of Canada under the Foreign Extraterritorial
_Measures Act (Canada), or by the Competition Tribunal under the Competition Act (Canada) in_
respect of certain judgments referred to in these statutes; and

     - the U.S. Judgment has been satisfied or is void or voidable under applicable foreign laws.


-----

**England and Wales**

The following summary with respect to the enforceability of certain U.S. court judgments in
England and Wales is based upon advice provided to us by U.S. and English legal advisors. The United
States and England currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement
of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final
judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability,
whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or
enforceable in England and Wales. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England and Wales,
proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England and Wales. In such
an action, an English court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the
U.S. court (subject to the following) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such
a claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it). Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by an
English court in such an action is conditional upon (among other things) the following:

     - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English
conflicts of laws principles and rules of English private international law;

     - the U.S. judgment having not been given contrary to an applicable jurisdiction or arbitration
clause or other agreement for the settlement of disputes under which the dispute in question was
to be settled otherwise than by proceedings in a U.S. court (to whose jurisdiction the judgment
debtor did not submit);

     - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and
unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a definite sum of money;

    - the U.S. judgment not contravening English public policy or statute (including the Human
Rights Act 1998);

     - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like
nature, or in respect of a penalty or fine;

    - the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a
sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained and not being otherwise in breach
of Section 5 of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980;

    - the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of
natural or substantial justice;

    - there not having been a prior inconsistent decision of an English court, or another court whose
judgment is entitled to recognition in England and Wales, in respect of the same matter; and

    - the English enforcement proceedings being commenced within six years from the date of the
U.S. judgment.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in England and Wales judgments in civil
and commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot
assure you that those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in England and Wales. In addition, it is
questionable whether an English court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original
action was commenced in England and Wales, instead of the United States, and predicated solely upon U.S.
federal securities laws.

**France**

The United States and France are not parties to a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters. Accordingly,
a judgment rendered by any U.S. Federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated
solely upon U.S. Federal or state securities laws, enforceable in the United States, would not directly be
recognized or enforceable in France. A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate
enforcement proceedings (exequatur) in France before the relevant civil court (Tribunal Judiciaire).
Enforcement in France of such U.S. judgment could be obtained following proper (i.e., non-ex parte)
proceedings if the civil court is satisfied that the following conditions have been met (which conditions,
under prevailing French case law, do not include a review by the French court of the merits of the foreign
judgment):


-----

    - such U.S. judgment was rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the matter in accordance
with French rules of international conflicts of jurisdiction (i.e., the dispute is clearly connected to
the United States and the French courts did not have exclusive jurisdiction over the matter);

    - such U.S. judgment does not contravene French international public policy rules, both pertaining
to the merits and to the procedure of the case;

    - such U.S. judgment is not tainted with fraud; and

    - such U.S. judgment does not conflict with a French judgment or a foreign judgment which has
become effective in France and there are no proceedings pending before French courts at the time
enforcement of the judgment is sought and having the same or similar subject matter as such
U.S. judgment.

If the French court is satisfied that such conditions are met, the U.S. judgment would have res
judicata and be enforceable in France, even during the period to lodge an appeal against the civil first
instance Court decision and during potential appeal proceedings, unless its enforceability is suspended by
Court decision until the end of such appeal proceedings.

In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely
affected under certain circumstances by French criminal law No. 68-678 of July 26, 1968, as modified by
French law No. 80-538 of July 16, 1980 and French Ordinance No. 2000-916 of September 19, 2000 (relating
to communication of documents and information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or
technical nature to foreign authorities or persons), Order No. 2022-207 of February 18, 2022 and Order of
the Ministry of Economy of March 7, 2022 (relating to communication of documents and information of an
economic, commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign authorities or persons) as well as
French law No. 2018-670 related to the protection of trade secrets, which could prohibit or restrict obtaining
evidence in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action.
Pursuant to the regulations above, the U.S. authorities would have to comply with international (1970 Hague
Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad) or French procedural rules to obtain evidence in France
or from French persons. Similarly, European and French data protection rules (including Regulation
(EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 on the protection of natural
persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and French
law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 on data processing, data files and individual liberties, as amended from time
to time) can limit under certain circumstances the possibility of obtaining information in France or from
French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action in a discovery context.

If an original action is brought in France, French courts may refuse to apply the designated law (or
part of it) if its application contravenes French public policy. In an action brought in France on the basis of
U.S. Federal or state securities laws, French courts may not have the requisite power to grant all the
remedies sought.

Pursuant to articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code, a French national (either a company or an
individual) can sue a foreign defendant before French courts (article 14) and can be sued by a foreign
claimant before French courts (article 15). For a long time, case law has interpreted these provisions as
meaning that a French national, either claimant or defendant, could not be forced against its will to appear
before a jurisdiction other than French courts and that the foreign decision issued in such circumstances
would not be recognized and enforced in France. However, according to currently established case law, the
French courts’ jurisdiction towards French nationals is no longer mandatory to the extent an action has been
commenced before a court in a jurisdiction which has sufficient contacts with the dispute and the choice
of jurisdiction is not fraudulent, and does not prevent the recognition and enforcement of the decision of
such foreign court. In addition, the French and foreign nationals may respectively waive their rights to benefit
from the provisions of articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code, including implicitly, by way of conduct
by voluntarily appearing before the foreign court.

It must be noted that under Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of
the Council of December 12, 2012, as regards legal actions falling within the scope of said Regulation, the
privileges granted to French nationals pursuant to Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code may not be
invoked against a person domiciled in an EU Member State. Conversely, pursuant to Article 6.2 of
Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012, the privilege granted by Article 14 of the French Civil Code may be
invoked by a claimant domiciled in France, regardless of the claimant’s nationality, to sue before French
courts a defendant domiciled outside the EU.


-----

The French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has recently held that a contractual provision
submitting one party to the exclusive jurisdiction of a court and giving another party the discretionary
option to choose any competent jurisdiction was invalid. Accordingly, any provisions to the same effect in
any relevant documents would not be binding on the party submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the court
or prevent a French party from bringing an action before the French courts.

**Germany**

The United States and Germany currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment
for a payment rendered by any court in the United States would not automatically be enforceable in
Germany.

Notwithstanding the preceding, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state
court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal
securities laws, would generally be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action before a German
court, and such German court generally will not investigate the merits of the original matter decided by a
U.S. court. The recognition and enforcement of the U.S. judgment by a German court would be conditional
upon a number of factors, including all of the following:

     - the ability of the U.S. court to take jurisdiction of the case in accordance with the principles of
jurisdictional competence under German law;

    - the document introducing the proceedings having been duly made known to the defendant in a
timely manner that allowed for adequate defense;

    - the judgment not being contrary to (i) any prior judgment which became res judicata rendered
by a German court or (ii) any prior judgment which became res judicata rendered by a foreign
court which is recognized in Germany, and the procedure leading to the U.S. judgment is not in
contradiction to any such prior judgment;

     - the effects of its recognition not being in conflict with material principles of German law,
including, without limitation, fundamental rights under the constitution of Germany
(Grundrechte). In this context, it should be noted that any component of a U.S. federal or state
court civil judgment awarding punitive damages or any other damages which do not serve a
compensatory purpose, such as treble damages, will not be enforced in Germany, as they are
regarded to be in conflict with material principles of German law;

    - the reciprocity of enforcement of judgments being guaranteed; and

    - the judgment having become res judicata in accordance with the law of the place where it was
pronounced.

Enforcement and foreclosure based on U.S. judgments may be sought against German defendants
after having received an enforcement decision from a competent German court in accordance with the
above principles. Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce judgments in Germany in civil
and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that those
judgments will be enforceable. In addition, it is doubtful whether a German court would accept jurisdiction
and impose civil liability in an original action predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.

Furthermore, in the past the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages has been denied by
German courts as incompatible with the substantial foundations of German law. Moreover, a German
court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent
that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages.

German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects.
With respect to the production of evidence, for example, U.S. federal and state law and the laws of several
other jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the
proceedings may, prior to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the
deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding.
No such pretrial discovery process exists under German law. If the party in whose favor such final judgment
is rendered brings a new lawsuit in a competent court in Germany, such party may submit to the German
court the final judgement rendered in the United States. Under such circumstances, a judgment by a federal
or state court of the United States against the Issuer or such persons will be regarded by a German court


-----

only as evidence of the outcome of the dispute to which such judgment relates. A German court may
choose to re-hear the dispute and may render a judgment not in line with the judgment rendered by a federal
or state court of the United States.

In addition, it may under certain circumstances also not be possible for investors to effect service of
process within Germany upon the Issuer or the Guarantors or those persons under the Convention on the
Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15,
1965 and the German law implementing such convention if such service were deemed to infringe German
sovereignty or security, which may be the case if such service violated the fundamental principles of German
law, in particular the civil rights (Grundrechte) guaranteed by virtue of the German Constitution
(Grundgesetz). However, the German Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) held in 2013 that
service may not be denied solely because the action before the U.S. court contains claims for punitive
damages.

**Jersey**

The following summary with respect to the enforceability of certain U.S. court judgments in Jersey
is based upon advice provided to us by Jersey legal advisors. The United States and Jersey currently do not
have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration
awards) in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any
Federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon
U.S. Federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in Jersey. In order to
enforce any such U.S. judgment in Jersey, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent
jurisdiction in Jersey. In such an action, a Jersey court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the
original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is said below) and it would usually be possible
to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it). Recognition and
enforcement of a U.S. judgment by a Jersey court in such an action is conditional upon (among other
things) the following:

     - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to Jersey conflict
of laws principles;

     - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and
unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a definite sum of money (although
there are circumstances where non-money judgments can also be enforced);

    - the U.S. judgment not contravening Jersey public policy;

     - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like
nature, or in respect of a penalty or fine;

    - the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a
sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained and not being otherwise in breach
of Section 5 of the United Kingdom Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 (as extended to
Jersey by the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 (Jersey) Order 1983);

    - the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of Jersey principles of natural
justice; and

     - there not having been a prior inconsistent decision of a Jersey court in respect of the same
matter.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in Jersey judgments in civil and commercial
matters that have been obtained from U.S. Federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that
those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in Jersey. In addition, it is questionable whether a Jersey
court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in Jersey,
instead of the United States, and predicated solely upon U.S. Federal securities laws.

**Luxembourg**

The Issuer has been advised by Luxembourg counsel that the United States and Luxembourg are
not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, except
for arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. According to such counsel, an enforceable
judgment for the payment of monies rendered by any U.S. Federal or state court based on civil liability,
whether or not predicated solely upon the U.S. securities laws, would not directly be enforceable in


-----

Luxembourg. However, a party who received such favorable judgment in a U.S. court may initiate
enforcement proceedings via an action for exequatur (exequatur) in Luxembourg pursuant to the provisions
of articles 678 et seq. of the Luxembourg new code of civil procedure (nouveau code de procédure civile),
by requesting enforcement of the U.S. judgment by the District Court (Tribunal d’Arrondissement) . The
District Court will authorize the enforcement in Luxembourg of the U.S. judgment if it is satisfied that all of
the following conditions are met:

     - the U.S. judgment is enforceable (exécutoire) in the United States;

    - the U.S. court awarding the judgment has jurisdiction, both according to its own national
jurisdiction rules and to the Luxembourg principles of conflicts of jurisdiction and in particular,
Luxembourg courts had no exclusive jurisdiction over the case at hand, to adjudicate the
respective matter under applicable U.S. Federal or state jurisdictions rules;

    - the U.S. court has applied to the dispute the substantive law which would have been applied by
Luxembourg courts in accordance with Luxembourg conflict of laws rules;

    - the U.S. judgment does not contravene Luxembourg international public policy or overriding
mandatory provisions of Luxembourg law;

    - the U.S. court has acted in accordance with its own procedural laws;

    - the principles of natural justice have been complied with and the U.S. judgment was granted
following proceedings where the defendant had the opportunity to appear and, if it appeared, to
present a defense; and

    - the U.S. judgment was not granted pursuant to an evasion of Luxembourg law (fraude à la loi
_luxembourgeoise)._

Luxembourg courts do currently not review the merits of New York judgments even though there
is no statutory prohibition of such review.

Under Luxembourg law, contractual provisions allowing the service of process against a party to a
service agent could be overridden by Luxembourg statutory provisions allowing the valid serving of process
against a party in accordance with applicable laws at the domicile of the party.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in Luxembourg judgments in civil and
commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. Federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure
you that those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in Luxembourg. In addition, it is questionable
whether a Luxembourg court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action
was commenced in Luxembourg instead of the United States, and predicated solely upon U.S. Federal
securities laws.

**Norway**

Norwegian courts will, as a general rule, not recognize or enforce judgments rendered by a foreign
court unless Norway has entered into a bilateral or multilateral treaty with the relevant country or countries
regarding the recognition and enforcement of judgments and subject to the provisions of Section 19-16 of
the Norwegian Dispute Act of June 17, 2005. No. 90 (the “Dispute Act”). Due to Norway’s accession to the
Lugano Convention on the Recognition of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters (the “Lugano
**Convention”), Norwegian courts will recognize and enforce any final civil judgment obtained in a foreign**
court of any state which is a party to the Lugano Convention, without a further reexamination of the merits
of the case. The exceptions stated in the Lugano Convention itself will apply.

Therefore, a judgment against the Issuer or any Guarantor in the courts of a state which is not,
under the terms of the Lugano Convention, a Contracting State (as defined in the Lugano Convention) or
a state with which Norway has entered into a convention on the mutual recognition and enforcement of
judgments, would not, as a general rule, be recognized or enforceable in Norway as a matter of right.

There is currently no treaty or bilateral agreement in place between the United States and Norway
that provides for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgment by a U.S federal or state court in civil
and commercial matters. Thus, a judgment from a U.S federal or state court would as a main rule not be
enforceable in Norway without an independent review of the merits of the case.

However, a judgment rendered by a foreign court (e.g., the courts of the United States) may
nevertheless be recognized and enforced in Norway without reexamination of the merits of the case if the


-----

foreign proceedings and the judgment itself fulfill the conditions stated in the Norwegian Enforcement Act
of June 26, 1992 No. 86 and he Dispute Act. Such conditions can include, without limitation:

     - the disputing parties having submitted the matter in dispute in writing to a court or tribunal in
the agreed jurisdiction,

    - there being no other mandatory venue for such dispute,

    - the judgment obtained being final and enforceable in and pursuant to the laws of the country
where it was rendered, and

    - the recognition and enforcement of the judgment not conflicting with Norwegian mandatory
laws or public policy.

However, a non-enforceable judgment by a foreign court may be admissible as evidence in the
courts of law, executive or other public authorities of Norway and may in such capacity carry persuasive
authority depending on the merits of the judgment without a retrial on its merits.

**Scotland**

The following summary with respect to the enforceability of certain U.S. court judgments in
Scotland is based upon advice provided to us by U.S. and Scottish legal advisors. The United States and
Scotland currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments
(as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for
payment rendered by any Federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not
predicated solely upon U.S. Federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in
Scotland. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in Scotland, proceedings must first be initiated
before a court of competent jurisdiction in Scotland. In such an action, a Scottish court would not generally
reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court and it would usually be possible to
obtain summary judgment on such a claim (subject to what is said below). Recognition and enforcement of a
U.S. judgment by a Scottish court in such an action is conditional upon (among other things) the following:

     - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to Scottish
conflicts of laws principles;

     - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and
unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a definite sum of money;

    - the U.S. judgment not contravening Scottish public policy;

     - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like
nature, or in respect of a penalty or fine;

    - the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a
sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained and not being otherwise in breach
of Section 5 of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980, or the judgment not being on a
claim for contribution in respect of damages awarded by a judgment based on a rule of law
specified under Section 5 of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980;

    - the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud;

    - the U.S. judgment resulted from proceedings which displayed a substantial degree of unfairness
or irregularity against the parties to the action, or otherwise contrary to the principles of natural
justice;

     - there not having been a prior inconsistent decision of a Scottish court between the same parties,
or a prior final judgment of another court having jurisdiction whose judgment is enforceable
in Scotland;

    - the U.S. judgment is affected by Section 32 of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982
where (1) the bringing of the proceedings was contrary to an agreement under which the dispute
in question was to be settled otherwise than by proceedings in the courts of that country,
(2) those proceedings were not brought in that court by or with the agreement of the person
against whom the judgment was given and (3) that person did not counterclaim in the proceedings
or otherwise submit to the jurisdiction of the court;

    - there not having been an order made and remaining effective under Section 9 of the Foreign
Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act 1933 applying that section to judgments of the original
court;


-----

    - the U.S. judgment having not been based on foreign measures which the Secretary of State
specifies under Section 1 of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 as regulating and
controlling international trade and which, in so far as they apply to persons carrying on business
in the United Kingdom, are damaging or threaten to damage the trading interests of the
United Kingdom; and

    - the claim not having become barred under the Prescription and Limitation (Scotland) Act 1973,
as amended by the Prescription (Scotland) Act 2018, or may be or become subject to defenses
of retention, compensation, set-off or counterclaim.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in Scotland judgments in civil and
commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. Federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure
you that those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in Scotland. In addition, it is questionable whether
a Scottish court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced
in Scotland, instead of the United States, and predicated solely upon U.S. Federal securities laws.

**Singapore**

Judgments by courts in the United States of America are not directly enforceable in Singapore as if
they were judgments of the Singapore courts. However, a final and conclusive judgment on the merits
properly obtained against (as the case may be) us or a Guarantor in any competent court of the United
States of America for a fixed sum of money payable by (as the case may be) us or such Guarantor in respect
of any legal suit or proceeding and which could be enforced by execution against (as the case may be) us
or such Guarantor in the jurisdiction of the relevant court and has not been stayed or satisfied in whole may
be sued on in Singapore as a debt due from (as the case may be) us or such Guarantor if:

     - the relevant court had jurisdiction over (as the case may be) us or such Guarantor in that (as the
case may be) we were or such Guarantor was, at the time such proceeding was instituted,
resident in the jurisdiction in which such proceeding had been commenced or had submitted to
the jurisdiction of the relevant court;

    - that judgment was not obtained by fraud;

    - that judgment does not amount to judgment on a matter previously determined by a Singapore
court and does not conflict with a judgment on the same matter given by any other court that is
enforceable in Singapore;

    - the enforcement of that judgment will not be contrary to public policy of Singapore;

     - that judgment had not been obtained in contravention of the principles of natural justice; and

     - that judgment of the relevant court did not include the payment of taxes, or a fine or penalty.

**Switzerland**

Judgments in civil or commercial matters of a non-Swiss court or authority will be recognized and
enforced against an individual or a legal entity with legal domicile or seat in Switzerland pursuant to a
bilateral or multilateral treaty or convention between the foreign country and Switzerland, e.g., the Lugano
Convention on Jurisdiction and Enforcement of Judgments of October 30, 2007. In case no applicable
treaty or convention exists, the rules of the Swiss Federal Act on Private International Law (“PILA”;
_Bundesgesetz vom 18. Dezember 1987 über das Internationale Privatrecht (IPRG)) apply._

Except for arbitral awards, there is currently no treaty or convention in effect pertaining to the
recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters between the United States of
America and Switzerland. Thus, Art. 25-32 PILA applies for the recognition and enforcement of a U.S.
federal or state court judgment in Switzerland. In cases where a U.S. money judgment shall be enforced, the
Swiss Federal Act on Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy and the Swiss Code of Civil Procedure
(Schweizerische Zivilprozessordnung vom 19. Dezember 2008 (ZPO)) applies in addition to the PILA. Please
see “Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests—
_Switzerland”._

A United States judgment may be recognized and enforced upon request by the courts of
Switzerland if certain requirements of the Swiss Federal Act on Private International Law are met, in
particular, that (i) the Swiss court determines that the foreign court had jurisdiction, (ii) the judgment of
such court has become final and non-appealable, (iii) the recognition of the foreign judgment is not manifestly


-----

contrary to Swiss public policy, (iv) the counterparty has been properly served with process according to
the law of the state of his/her/its domicile or ordinary residence (if in Switzerland, through judicial aid
granted by the Swiss authorities) or the counterparty has unconditionally joined the proceedings, (v) the
proceedings leading to the judgment have respected the fundamental principles of Swiss procedural law and,
in particular, that the counterparty has been granted the right to be heard and (vi) no action between the
same parties and on the same subject matter has been commenced or decided first in Switzerland and no
decision between the same parties and on the same subject matter has been first decided in a third state, which
decision may be recognized in Switzerland.

Further, valid submission to the jurisdiction of a foreign court, in particular of a U.S. court or
authority, is established (i) if a provision of the PILA so provides or, in the absence of such provision, the
defendant had his legal domicile in the country in which the decision was rendered; or (ii) if parties who, in
a pecuniary dispute, entered into an agreement valid under PILA, submitted their dispute to the
jurisdiction of the court or authority which rendered the judgment; or (iii) if the defendant, in a pecuniary
dispute, proceeded on the merits without objecting to jurisdiction; or (iv) if, in the event of a counterclaim, the
court or authority which rendered the decision had jurisdiction over the principal claim and there is a
factual connection between the principal claim and the counterclaim. It is uncertain whether this practice
extends to default judgments as well.

Moreover, a Swiss court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize
damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. Enforcement
and recognition of judgments of U.S. courts in Switzerland are governed by the provisions of the Swiss Civil
Procedure Code. The judgment of a Swiss court or authority of first instance concerning recognition and
enforcement of a foreign judgment, including a U.S. judgment, is generally subject to appeal (on the cantonal
level as well as on the federal level).

Subject to the foregoing, holders of the Notes may be able to enforce in Switzerland judgments in
civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts; however, we cannot assure you that
those judgments will be enforceable. Awards of punitive damages or other types of penalty in original
actions outside Switzerland may also not be enforceable in Switzerland. It is uncertain whether a Swiss court
would recognize U.S. jurisdiction if the defendant did not enter an appearance before a U.S. court during
the substantive proceedings in the sense of article 6 PILA. It is doubtful whether a Swiss court would accept
jurisdiction and impose civil liability if proceedings were commenced in Switzerland predicated solely
upon U.S. federal or state securities law. In addition, in an action brought in a Swiss court on the basis of
U.S. federal or state securities laws, the Swiss courts may not have the requisite power to grant the remedies
sought. Swiss civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects.
Insofar as the production of evidence is concerned, U.S. law and the laws of several other jurisdictions
based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may
prior to trial compel the production of documents by adverse or third-parties and the deposition of witnesses.
Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pre-trial
discovery process exists under Swiss law and a Swiss court would generally decide on the basis of evidence
provided by the parties during the trial and in accordance with the applicable rules on the burden of proof. No
statement can be made as to the time and efficiency of the recognition and enforcement in Switzerland of
a foreign judgment considering that recognition and enforcement proceedings tend to be time consuming in
Switzerland.

Under Swiss law, any amount denominated in a foreign currency which has to be enforced through
Swiss debt collection authorities (schweizerische Zwangsvollstreckungsbehörden) has to be converted into
Swiss francs.

Swiss law documents may be executed in English. However, in case of enforcement the Swiss
courts or any other official Swiss authority may require that the transaction documents and any judgment
obtained in a foreign court be translated into one of the official languages of Switzerland.

The instruction and appointment of an agent and any power of attorney may be revoked at any
time under Swiss law notwithstanding the appointment, instruction or power of attorney being said to be
irrevocable and any mandate may, as a matter of statutory Swiss law, be terminated at any time by each party
to the mandate.

Judicial documents may not be served directly from abroad, including from the United States of
America, to a person in Switzerland (see Switzerland’s reservations to the Hague Convention on Service
Abroad of Judicial or Extra-Judicial Documents in Civil and Commercial Matter concluded on November 15,
1965). Instead, service needs to be effected by way of judicial assistance.

To the Board of Directors of
INEOS Group Holdings S.A.
58, rue Charles Martel
L-2134 Luxembourg

**Report on Review of Interim Financial Information**

**_Introduction_**

We have reviewed the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements
of INEOS Group Holdings S.A. comprising the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as at
September 30, 2023, the unaudited condensed consolidated income statement, the unaudited condensed
consolidated statement of other comprehensive income for the three and nine month period then ended, the
unaudited condensed consolidated statement of change in equity and the unaudited condensed consolidated
statement of cash flows for the nine month period then ended and a summary of significant accounting
policies and other explanatory notes (“the interim financial information”).

The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of this interim
financial information in accordance with International Accounting Standard IAS 34 on Interim Financial
Statements, as adopted by the European Union. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on this interim
financial information based on our review.

**_Scope of Review_**

We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements
(ISRE) 2410 “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the
Entity”. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons
responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A
review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on
Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all
significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

**_Conclusion_**

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the
accompanying interim financial information does not give a true and fair view of the financial position of
the company as at September 30, 2023 and of the results of its operations for the three and nine month period
then ended in accordance with the International Accounting Standard IAS 34 on Interim Financial
Statements as adopted by the European Union.

**INEOS GROUP HOLDINGS S.A.**

**NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**1. BASIS OF PREPARATION**

The condensed consolidated interim financial statements include INEOS Group Holdings S.A.
and all its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”). Intra-group transactions and balances have
been eliminated on consolidation. The financial and operating results for any period less than a year are not
necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for a full year. The Group does not experience
any significant seasonality in its operating results.

These condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on the historical
cost basis, except for certain assets and liabilities that have been measured at fair value, principally equity
investments taken through other comprehensive income, as well as derivative financial instruments and the
assets and liabilities of the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes measured at fair value and using the
projected unit credit method, respectively.

These condensed consolidated interim financial statements are presented in euro, which is the
functional currency of the majority of operations of the Group and is consistent with the audited financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2022.

The significant judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty applicable to the preparation
of the condensed consolidated interim financial statements are described within note 15. In each case,
judgements have been applied consistently and estimates made using a consistent methodology, with inputs
and assumptions updated to reflect the Group’s latest forecasts and prevailing market conditions at the
balance sheet date as appropriate.

The accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Group are
unaudited.

Whilst there is still uncertainty due to the disruption on the energy market resulting from the
conflict in Ukraine, the Directors have undertaken a rigorous assessment of the potential impact on
demand for the Group’s products and services and the impact on margins for the next 12 months and the
Directors do not expect a material impact on the Group’s ability to operate as a going concern.

The Group meets its day to day working capital requirements through its cash generation from
Group operations. The Group held cash balances of €2,219.9 million at September 30, 2023 and interestbearing loans and borrowings (net of debt issue costs) of €9,971.4 million at September 30, 2023. The
Directors have considered the Group’s projected future cash flows and working capital requirements and are
confident that the Company has sufficient cashflows to meet its working capital requirements for the next
twelve months from the date of this report. In particular, the Directors have stress tested the forecasts through
taking account of reasonable possible changes in trading performance on the impact on EBITDA, cash
flow and debt. The stress tests show that the Group will still have sufficient cash flow to meet all of its
obligations as they fall due within the next 12 months from the date of this report.

On the basis of this assessment together with net assets of €5,524.9 million as at September 30,
2023 and the Group’s ability to meet working capital requirements through its external financing facilities,
along with access to cash generated by its subsidiaries, the Directors have concluded that the Group can
operate within its current facilities without the need to obtain new ones for a period of at least 12 months
from the date of this report and have therefore prepared these financial statements on a going concern basis.

**2. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

The financial information has been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with
IAS 34 “Interim financial reporting” as adopted by the European Union. In compliance with IAS 34, the
Company has opted for a condensed scope of reporting in the condensed interim financial statements

The exchange movements reflect net foreign exchange gains or losses associated with short term
intra group funding.

**5. TAXATION**

Taxes on income in the interim periods are accrued using the tax rate that would be applicable to
the expected total annual profit or loss.

After adjusting for the results from the share of associates and joint ventures, the effective tax rate
of approximately 30% reflects the anticipated tax rate for the Group for the full year. After adjusting for the
results from the share of associates and joint ventures, the underlying effective tax rate in the same period
in 2022 was approximately 18%, which reflected the anticipated tax rate for the full year. The higher anticipated
tax rate for the nine month period ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022
reflected decreased profitability in countries with lower corporate tax rates.

The group has applied the temporary exception, introduced in May 2023, from the accounting
requirements for deferred taxes in IAS 12, so that the group neither recognises nor discloses information
about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes.

**6. SHARE OF PROFIT/(LOSS) OF ASSOCIATES AND JOINT VENTURES USING THE EQUITY**
**ACCOUNTING METHOD AND INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY-ACCOUNTED INVESTEES**

The share of loss from associates and joint ventures in the nine month period ended September 30,
2023 primarily reflected the Group’s share of losses from the SECCO joint venture with Sinopec which was
acquired in December 2022. The share of profit from associates and joint ventures in the nine month
period ended September 30, 2022 primarily reflected the Group’s share of the results of the Refining joint
venture with PetroChina. On December 23, 2022 the Group disposed of its non-voting ordinary shares in
II(J)L to INEOS Limited, a related party, with an effective date of November 30, 2022, so after this date
the Group no longer had any economic interest in the Refining joint venture.

In July 2023, the Group signed a shareholders’ agreement with Sinopec relating to a proposed joint
venture in respect of a 1,200kt per annum ethylene cracker and related derivative plants in Tianjin, China.
Following an IAS 28 assessment the Group has determined that it has significant influence over the
investment, therefore this has resulted in the recognition of an investment in equity-accounted investees of
RMB 4,425 million (€573.5 million) which represents the latest view of the 50% equity share of the joint
venture (see Note 15). As at September 30,2023 the Group has also recognised a financial liability at fair
value through profit and loss of the same value within its balance sheet (see Note 11).

**7. EXCEPTIONAL FINANCE COSTS**

In April 2023, the Group successfully completed a syndication of the Rain acquisition financing
originally funded in December 2022 (see Note 9). As part of the syndication, which increased the numbers
of lenders to ten, the debt was increased to $785 million and RMB 1,045 million. Following an assessment of
the amendment to the facility it was deemed to be a substantial modification which resulted in an
exceptional finance cost for the write-off of unamortised debt issue costs of €8.5 million during
September 2023.

**8. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT**

In the nine month period ended September 30, 2023, the Group spent €986.8 million (nine month
period ended September 30, 2022: €674.9 million) on property, plant and equipment. The main capital
expenditures in the O&P North America segment related to turnaround expenditure. The main capital
expenditures in the O&P Europe segment related to the completion of the cogeneration project at the Köln,
Germany site, expenditure on a new ARG compressor, a turnaround on a polyethylene unit, a turnaround
on a cracker and aromatics unit and expenditure on Project ONE. The main expenditure in the Chemical
Intermediates segment was further growth expenditure by the Oligomers business on the LAO platform at
Chocolate Bayou, USA and by the Phenol business on the new cumene unit project at Marl, Germany. There
was also turnaround expenditure by the Oligomers business at Chocolate Bayou, USA. The remaining
capital expenditure related primarily to sustenance expenditure.

**_Senior Secured Term Loans_**

The Group has outstanding borrowings under a senior credit facilities agreement dated April 27,
2012 (as amended and restated) which consist of euro and US dollar denominated Term Loans (referred to
as the ‘Senior Secured Term Loans’ or ‘Term Loans’).

In February 2023 the Group issued new Senior Secured Term Loans and Senior Secured Notes.
The Senior Secured Term Loans included €700 million maturing in November 2027 and $1.2 billion
maturing in February 2030. Proceeds from the new Senior Secured Term Loans and Senior Secured Notes
were used to fully redeem the euro and US dollar denominated Term Loans maturing on March 31, 2024 as
well as increasing the liquidity of the Group. In November 2022 the Group extended its maturity profile
by issuing new Senior Secured Term Loan maturing in November 2027, consisting of €800 million of euro
denominated Term Loans and $1.2 billion of US dollar denominated Term Loans which were used to partially
redeem the euro and US dollar denominated Term Loans maturing on March 31, 2024. In November 2021
the Group raised €1.1 billion of additional Senior Secured Term Loans which were used to fully redeem
the outstanding Senior Notes due 2024. The additional Senior Secured Term Loans mature on November 8,
2028 and consisted of $845 million of US dollar denominated Term Loans and €350 million of euro
denominated Term Loans. In October 2020 the Group issued new euro denominated Senior Secured Term
Loans of €375 million which mature on October 27, 2027.

The Senior Secured Term Loans outstanding at September 30, 2023 before issue costs were
€5,266.3 million (December 31, 2022: €5,424.7 million) of which €34.6 million (December 31, 2022:


-----

**INEOS GROUP HOLDINGS S.A.**

**NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**10. BORROWINGS (continued)**

€56.3 million) is due within one year. The total amounts outstanding on the Euro denominated Term Loans
were €2,214.7 million (December 31, 2022: €2,770.9 million) and the US dollar denominated Term Loans
were €3,051.6 million (December 31, 2022: €2,653.8 million).

The Term Loans are to be repaid in equal quarterly instalments, in aggregate annual amounts
equal to 1% of the original principal amount of the Term Loans up to the final maturity date, apart from
the euro denominated Term Loans maturing November 2027 and November 2028 which have no repayments
until maturity. The €700 million euro denominated Term Loans issued in February 2023 mature on
November 8, 2027 and the € $1.2 billion US dollar denominated Term Loans issued in February 2023
mature on February 16, 2030. The €800 million euro denominated Term Loans and $1.2 billion US dollar
denominated Term Loans issued in November 2022 mature on November 8, 2027. The $845 million US dollar
denominated Term Loans and €350 million of euro denominated Term Loans issued in November 2021
mature on November 8, 2028, whilst the €375 million euro denominated Senior Secured Term Loans issued
in October 2020 mature on October 27, 2027.

The outstanding Term Loans denominated in US dollars bear interest at a rate per annum equal to
SOFR plus 0.10% (with the $845 million US dollar denominated Term Loans maturing in November 2028
being subject to a floor of 0.50% per annum) plus the Applicable Margin. All of the Term Loans denominated
in euros bear interest at a rate per annum equal to EURIBOR subject to a floor of 0.5% per annum plus
the Applicable Margin.

As at September 30, 2023 the Applicable Margin for the €700 million euro denominated Term
Loans maturing November 2027 was 4.00%, for the $1.2 billion US dollar denominated Term Loans
maturing November 2030 it was 3.50%, for the euro denominated Term Loans maturing October 2027 and
November 2028 it was 2.75%, for the US dollar denominated Term Loans maturing November 2028 it
was 2.50%, for the €800 million euro denominated Term Loans maturing November 2027 it was 4.00% and
for the US dollar denominated Term Loans maturing November 2027 it was 3.75%.

The Senior Secured Term Loans rank pari passu with the Senior Secured Notes due May 2026,
Senior Secured Notes due March 2026, Senior Secured Notes due 2025 and the Senior Secured Notes due
2028. The Term Loans are guaranteed by INEOS Group Holdings S.A., INEOS Holdings Limited and
certain of their subsidiaries on a senior secured basis. The Term Loans and the guarantees are secured by
first ranking liens on the same assets (subject to certain exceptions) that secure INEOS Holdings Limited’s
obligations under the senior secured notes.

The Term Loans have numerous customary operating and financial incurrence covenants all of
which have been complied with during the period, including covenants relating to, among other things,
limitations on indebtedness, ability to give guarantees, creation of security interests, making acquisitions
and investments, disposing of assets and paying dividends. The Term Loans have no financial maintenance
covenants.

purpose vehicle of the Flemish government) and (iii) a Commercial Facility to fund the construction of
Project One, a 1,450 ktpa ethane cracker and olefins complex located in the port of Antwerp. The ability to
draw the funds was contingent on the receipt of certain guarantees which completed in February 2023.
The Group expects the Project One Facility to be drawn in stages throughout the construction period to the
end of 2026.

The total amount outstanding at September 30, 2023 before issue costs was €522.0 million
(December 31, 2022: nil).

agents and the upfront Export Credit Agency Guarantee premiums paid to UKEF, CESCE and SACE.

On July 20, 2023 the Group received a decision from the Council for Permit Disputes annulling the
permit for Project One. As a result of the annulment of the permit, no further drawings may be made until
such time as a new permit is reissued. Under the terms of the facility there is a period of up to 18 months to
achieve this. In January 2024 a new permit was reissued for Project One when the Group’s appeal to
reconfirm the permit was granted by the Flemish Minister for Justice and Enforcement, Environment and
Spatial Development and Energy and Tourism, so construction of Project One has now resumed.

**_Project One Interim Facility_**

On September 15, 2023, the Group entered into certain agreements (the “Project One Interim
Facility”) providing for loans in an aggregate principal amount of €400 million under a facility partially
guaranteed by Gigarant (a special purpose vehicle of the Flemish government). This is a short dated facility
repayable within 364 days. The debt will continue to be drawn in stages based on the ongoing cash
requirements of the project. The Group expects to repay the Project One Interim Facility from the original
Project One Facility following the reinstatement of the permit. In January 2024 a new permit was reissued for
Project One when the Group’s appeal to reconfirm the permit was granted by the Flemish Minister for
Justice and Enforcement, Environment and Spatial Development and Energy and Tourism, so construction
of Project One has now resumed.

The total amount outstanding at September 30, 2023 before issue costs was €85.0 million
(December 31, 2022: nil). The facility is stated net of debt issue costs of €2.0 million (December 31, 2022:

The carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value of trade receivables and payables.

The financial assets/liabilities categorised as Fair Value through Profit and Loss (FVTPL)
presented in Level 2 contains commodity and interest rate swap derivatives. The financial assets/liabilities
categorised as Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI) presented in Level 3 contains
equity securities.

The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The
different levels, determined in accordance with IFRS 13 “Fair Value Measurement”, have been defined as
follows:

     - Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

     - Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset
or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and

The commodity derivatives are fair valued using rates in a quoted market. There have been no
transfers between levels during the nine month period ended September 30, 2023 (2022: no transfers
between levels).

**_Net investment hedges_**

The Group has US$ and Sterling financial liabilities in respect of the Senior Notes and Securitisation
Facility that are designated net investment hedges of US$ and Sterling operations in accordance with the
requirements of IFRS 9. For the nine month period ended September 30, 2023, gains net of tax of €6.3 million
were taken directly to reserves and reported in the Statement of Comprehensive Income for the period
then ended (nine month period ended September 30, 2022: gains €875.5 million,. There was no ineffectiveness
recognised in the income statement for the nine month period ended September 30, 2023 (nine month
period ended September 30, 2022: €nil). The cumulative net investment hedge reserve amount as at
December 31, 2023 was €642.5 million (December 31, 2022: €636.2 million).

**_Credit risk_**

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial
instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from
customers, deposits with financial institutions and derivatives.


-----

**INEOS GROUP HOLDINGS S.A.**

**NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**11. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)**

Group Treasury policy and objectives in relation to credit risk is to minimize the likelihood that the
Group will experience financial loss due to counterparty failure. The Group has established a credit policy
under which each new customer is analysed individually for creditworthiness before the Group’s standard
payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered or are adjusted accordingly. The Group’s review
includes external ratings, when available, and in some cases bank references. Purchase limits are established
for each customer, which represent the maximum open amount without requiring approval.

Customers that fail to meet the Group’s benchmark creditworthiness may transact with the Group
only on a prepayment basis.

**_Liquidity risk_**

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall
due. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have
sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under normal and stressed conditions, without incurring
unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group. The Group’s exposure to liquidity risk is limited by
the fact that it operates with significant cash resources, and it maintains the most appropriate mix of short,
medium and long-term borrowings from the Group’s lenders.

The Group is reliant on committed funding from a variety of sources at Group and subsidiary
company level to meet the anticipated needs of the Group for the period covered by the Group’s budget.

The Group forecasts on a regular basis the expected cash flows that will occur on a weekly and
monthly basis. This information is used in conjunction with the weekly reporting of actual cash balances at
bank in order to calculate the level of funding that will be required in the short and medium term. On a
monthly basis the level of headroom on existing facilities is reported and forecast forward until the end of
the financial period.

**_Currency risk_**

The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various
currency exposures. A substantial portion of the Group’s revenue is generated in, or linked to, the U.S.
dollar and the euro. In the European petrochemical business, product prices, certain feedstock costs and
most other costs are denominated in euro and sterling. In the U.S. petrochemical and specialty chemicals
businesses, product prices, raw materials costs and most other costs are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars.

The Group has established a currency risk policy under which material currency flows are analysed
and if management considers it needed the risks are mitigated. The Group looks at transactional and
translation currency risks.

**_Commodity price risk_**

The Group is exposed to commodity price risk through fluctuations in raw material prices and
sales of products. The raw material exposures result primarily from the price of crude oil and base chemicals
linked to the price of crude. The sales price exposures are primarily related to petrochemicals where prices
are in general linked to the market price of crude oil.

The Group enters into contracts to supply or acquire physical volumes of commodities at future
dates during the normal course of business that may be considered derivative contracts. Where such
contracts exist and are in respect of the normal purchase or sale of products to fulfil the Group’s
requirements, the own use exemption from derivative accounting is applied.

The Group manages commodity price exposures through trading refined products and chemical
feedstock and using commodity swaps, options and futures as a means of managing price and timing risks.
As at September 30, 2023 there was a net mark to market derivative liability in respect of commodity
contracts of €10.9 million entered into by the Group to manage such risk (December 31, 2022: net derivative
liability of €5.7 million).

The Group operates within procedures and policies designed to ensure that risks, including those
relating to the default of counterparties, are minimised.

The fair values disclosed are provisional due to the proximity of the acquisition to the preparation
of these financial statements so further work will be required to confirm final fair values. The finalisation of
the work to determine the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired will be completed within
12 months of the acquisition date.

The difference between consideration and net assets acquired has been recognised as provisional
goodwill within intangible assets. The provisional goodwill has been allocated to the Phenol CGU and is
not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.

**15. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS**

The Group prepares its unaudited condensed, consolidated financial statements in accordance
with IFRSs, which require management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions which affect the
application of the accounting policies, and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing
basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates change and in any
future periods.

**Key sources of estimated uncertainty**

Estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that the
Group believe are reasonable, including assets and expected economic conditions, and in certain cases
actuarial assumption. Although these estimates are based on the Group’s knowledge of current events and
circumstances, actual numbers may differ.

**_Post-retirement benefits_**

The Group operates a number of defined benefit post-employment schemes. Under IAS 19
Revised Employee Benefits, management is required to estimate the present value of the future defined
benefit obligation of each of the defined benefit schemes. The costs and year end obligations under defined
benefit schemes are determined using actuarial valuations. The actuarial valuations involve making
numerous assumptions, including:

     - Future rate of increase in salaries;

     - Inflation rate projections;

     - Discount rate for scheme liabilities; and

    - Expected rates of return on the scheme assets.

**INEOS GROUP HOLDINGS S.A.**

**NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**15. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS (continued)**

**_Impairment reviews_**

IFRSs require management to test for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets with
indefinite lives, on an annual basis, and of tangible and intangible assets with finite lives if events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.

An impairment test requires an assessment as to whether the carrying value of assets can be
supported by its recoverable amount. Management calculates the recoverable amount based on the net
present value of the future cash flows derived from the relevant assets, using cash flow projections which
have been discounted at an appropriate discount rate.

In calculating the net present value of the future cash flows, certain assumptions and estimates are
required to be made in respect of highly uncertain matters, including management’s expectations of:

    - Growth rates of various revenue streams;

    - Long term growth rates;

    - Future margins;

     - The selection of an appropriately risk adjusted discount rate; and

    - The determination of terminal values.

Changing the assumptions selected by management, in particular the discount rate used in the
present value calculation, could significantly affect the Group’s impairment evaluation and results.

For the purpose of impairment testing (when required), to assess whether any impairment exists,
estimates are made of the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual
disposal. Actual outcomes could vary significantly from such estimates of discounted future cash flows.
Factors such as changes in the planned use of buildings, plant or equipment, or closure of facilities, the
presence or absence of competition, lower than expected asset utilisation from events such as unplanned
outages, strikes and hurricanes, technical obsolescence or lower than anticipated sales of products with
capitalised intellectual property rights could result in shortened useful lives or impairment. Changes in the
discount rates used could also lead to impairments.

**_Fair value measurement on business combination_**

The amount of goodwill initially recognised as a result of a business combination is dependent on
the allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired. The
determination of the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities is to a considerable extent based upon
management’s judgement and estimates and assumptions made.

Allocation of the purchase price affects the results of the Group as intangible assets are amortised
over their estimated useful lives, whereas goodwill, is not amortised. This could lead to differing amortisation
charges based on the allocation to indefinite and finite lived intangible assets.

On acquisition of a business, the identifiable intangible assets may include customer contracts,
customer relationships and preferential supply contracts. The fair value of these assets is determined by
discounting estimated future net cash flows generated by the asset. The use of different estimates and
assumptions for the expectations of future cash flows and the discount rate would change the valuation of
these intangible assets.

**_Investment in equity-accounted investees_**

In July 2023, the Group signed a shareholders’ agreement with Sinopec relating to a proposed joint
arrangement in respect of the construction and operation of a 1,200kt per annum ethylene cracker and
related derivative plants in Tianjin, China. The joint arrangement will be structured through a separate legal
entity: INEOS Sinopec (Tianjin) Petrochemicals Limited.

The Group has applied its accounting policies when assessing whether it has control, joint control,
or significant influence over INEOS Sinopec (Tianjin) Petrochemicals Limited.


-----

**INEOS GROUP HOLDINGS S.A.**

**NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**15. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS (continued)**

‘Significant influence’ is the power to participate in an entity’s financial and operating policy
decisions, but it is not control or joint control of those policies. Significant influence is presumed when an
entity owns 20% or more of the voting power of the investee.

To assess whether the Group controls or joint controls INEOS Sinopec (Tianjin) Petrochemicals
Limited, the Group has evaluated whether it has the power to direct the relevant activities of INEOS
Sinopec (Tianjin) Petrochemicals Limited when the Group acquires its 50% equity interest. In making this
judgement, the Group assessed what the relevant activities of the entity are, and how these are directed.
INEOS Sinopec (Tianjin) Petrochemicals Limited is currently in the construction phase of the cracker.
Although the Group has a 50% equity interest and has representation on the board of directors of INEOS
Sinopec (Tianjin) Petrochemicals Limited, the Group concluded that it currently does not have control or
joint control because it does not currently have the power to direct the relevant activities of INEOS
Sinopec (Tianjin) Petrochemicals Limited. This is because, Sinopec has contractual rights to direct all of
the relevant activities of the construction phase. However, the Group assessed that, through its participation
in the Board, it has the ability to exercise significant influence over the financial and operational decision
of the INEOS Sinopec (Tianjin) Petrochemicals Limited. The Group will therefore account for its interest in
INEOS Sinopec (Tianjin) Petrochemicals Limited as an equity-accounted associate under IAS 28 (see
Note 6).

The Group will continue to reassess the conclusion on control if facts and circumstances indicate
that there has been a change in the assessment of power over the relevant activities in INEOS Sinopec
(Tianjin) Petrochemicals Limited.

**16. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS**

In December 2023, the Group declared a dividend of €697.5 million payable to its immediate
parent, INEOS Holdings Luxembourg S.A. of which €250.0 million was paid in cash.

In December 2023, the Group announced an agreement with LyondellBasell to buy its ethylene
oxide and derivatives business including the Bayport Underwood site, Texas. The deal includes the 420kt
ethylene oxide plant, the 375kt ethylene glycols plant and the 165kt glycol ethers plant together with all
associated third-party business on the site, for $700 million. The acquisition is still subject to competition
clearance.

In December 2023, the Group extended the maturity date of the receivables securitisation facility
to December 2026.

In January 2024, a new permit was reissued for Project One when the Group’s appeal to reconfirm
the permit was granted by the Flemish Minister for Justice and Enforcement, Environment and Spatial
Development and Energy and Tourism, so construction of Project One has now resumed.

**REPORT OF THE REVISEUR D’ENTREPRISES AGREE**

**Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements**

**Opinion**

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Ineos Group Holdings S.A. and its
subsidiaries (the “Group”), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at
December 31, 2022, and the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive
income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year
then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant
accounting policies.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of
the consolidated financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2022, and of its consolidated financial
performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.

**Basis for Opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Law of July 23, 2016 on the audit profession (Law
of July 23, 2016) and with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) as adopted for Luxembourg by the
_“Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier” (CSSF). Our responsibilities under the Law of July 23,_
2016 and ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF are further described in the “Responsibilities of
the “réviseur d’entreprises agréé” for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements” section of our
report. We are also independent of the Group in accordance with the International Code of Ethics for
Professional Accountants, including International Independence Standards, issued by the International
Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA Code) as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF together
with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements, and
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities under those ethical requirements. We believe that the audit
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

**Other information**

The Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises
the information stated in the consolidated annual report including the management report but does not
include the consolidated financial statements and our report of the “réviseur d’entreprises agréé” thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we
do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read
the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent
with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to
be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report this fact. We have nothing to report in
this regard.

**Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial**
**Statements**

The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated
financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, and for such internal
control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for
assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to
going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends
to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting
process.

**Responsibilities of the “réviseur d’entreprises agréé” for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue a
report of the “réviseur d’entreprises agréé” that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level
of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Law of July 23, 2016 and
with ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF will always detect a material misstatement when it
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis
of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with the Law of July 23, 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for
Luxembourg by the CSSF, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism
throughout the audit. We also:

     - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and
obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The
risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting
from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations,
or the override of internal control.

     - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.

    - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors.

    - Conclude on the appropriateness of Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists
related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue
as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw
attention in our report of the “réviseur d’entreprises agréé” to the related disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report of the
_“réviseur d’entreprises agréé”. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to_
cease to continue as a going concern.

     - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the
underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.


-----

     - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities
and business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial
statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit.
We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal
control that we identify during our audit.

**Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements**

The consolidated management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and
has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

**Overview**

INEOS Group Holdings S.A. (the “Company”) is a company incorporated and domiciled in the
form of a société anonyme under the laws of the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg, having its registered office
at 62 Avenue de la Liberté L-1930, Luxembourg, Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg. The nature of the
operations and principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries are the manufacture and sale of a
range of petrochemical products used in a variety of applications.

**Basis of accounting**

The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together
referred to as the “Group”) and equity account the Group’s interest in associates and joint ventures.

The Group continues to implement contingency plans for the COVID-19 pandemic, with the
primary objective of maintaining the safety of personnel and the reliable operation of the Group’s plants.

The chemical industry is deemed as essential, critical infrastructure by governments across the
world. Throughout the pandemic all of the Group’s plants have continued to operate fully and supply
chains have operated without significant disruption. Protecting employees and ensuring that they remain
healthy has been the first priority of the Group. All plants have sufficient resources and have implemented
measures to ensure that this remains the case throughout the pandemic.

The Group does not have operations in Belarus, Russia or Ukraine. During 2022, 2021 and 2020
revenue generated in these countries was not material to the Group. The Group is not currently experiencing
any material disruption to its operations and does not foresee any direct impact as a result of the conflict,
but will continue to monitor the evolving situation closely.

Whilst there is still uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the disruption on the energy
market resulting from the conflict in Ukraine, the Directors have undertaken a rigorous assessment of the
potential impact on demand for the Group’s products and services and the impact on margins for the next
12 months and the Directors do not expect a material impact on the Group’s ability to operate as a going
concern.

The Group meets its day to day working capital requirements through its cash generation from
Group operations. The Group held cash balances of €2,639.1 million at 31 December 2022 (2021:
€2,106.1 million, 2020: €1,342.2 million) and interest-bearing loans and borrowings (net of debt issue costs)
of €8,753.8 million at 31 December 2022 (2021: €7,739.3 million, 2020: €7,581.8 million) of which
€308.3 million is due to be repaid within 12 months of signing the financial statements. The Directors have
considered the Group’s projected future cash flows and working capital requirements and are confident that
the Group has sufficient cashflows to meet its working capital requirements for the next twelve months
from the date of signing the financial statements. In particular, the Directors have stress tested the forecasts
through taking account of reasonable possible changes in trading performance on the impact on EBITDA,
cash flow and debt. The stress tests show that the Group will still have sufficient cash flow to meet all of its
obligations as they fall due within the next 12 months from the date of signing the financial statements.

On the basis of this assessment together with net assets of €5,521.4 million as at 31 December 2022
(2021: €3,353.0 million, 2020: €1,461.6 million) and the Group’s ability to meet working capital requirements
through its external financing facilities, along with access to cash generated by its subsidiaries, the Directors
have concluded that the Group can operate within its current facilities without the need to obtain new
ones for a period of at least 12 months from the date of this report and have therefore prepared these financial
statements on a going concern basis.

The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union in response
to the IAS regulation (EC 1606/2002) effective as of 31 December 2022 and have been approved for issuance
by the Board of Directors on 17 March 2023.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all
periods presented in these Group financial statements.

**Measurement convention**

The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative financial
instruments, financial instruments classified as fair value through the profit or loss or fair value through
other comprehensive income (FVOCI) which are stated at their fair value.

**Functional and presentation currency**

These Group financial statements are presented in euro, which is the functional currency of the
majority of operations, with other significant currencies being USD and Sterling. The Group’s primary
products are sold in an international commodities market which is priced and invoiced primarily in euros.

All financial information presented in euro has been rounded to the nearest €0.1 million.

**Changes in accounting policies**

The Group financial statements have been prepared using accounting policies that are consistent
with those of the previous financial year. The Group has re-presented receipts from derivative contracts of
€257.8 million for the year ended 31 December 2021 and €0.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2020
which are now shown net of payments on derivative contracts within interest paid and other finance items
in the consolidated statement of cash flows . The Group has adopted the following amendments to accounting
standards for the first time in 2022, with effect from 1 January 2022, although there has been no material
effect on the Group’s financial statements:

    - Amendments to IAS 37: Onerous Contracts—Cost of Fulfilling a Contract.

The amendments specify that the cost of fulfilling a contract comprises the costs that relate
directly to the contract. Costs that relate directly to a contract consist of both the incremental
costs of fulfilling that contract (examples would be direct labour or materials) and an allocation
of other costs that relate directly to fulfilling contracts (an example would be the allocation of the
depreciation charge for an item of property, plant and equipment used in fulfilling the contract).

    - Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS 3.

The amendments update a reference to the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting
without changing the accounting requirements for business combinations.

    - Amendments to IAS 16: Property, Plant and Equipment—Proceeds before Intended Use.

Under the amendments, proceeds from selling items before the related item of Property, Plant
and Equipment is available for use should be recognised in profit or loss, together with the costs
of producing those items. IAS 2 Inventories should be applied in identifying and measuring
these production costs.

The amendments also clarify the meaning of ‘testing whether an asset is functioning properly’.
IAS 16 now specifies this as assessing whether the technical and physical performance of the asset
is such that it is capable of being used in the production or supply of goods or services, for
rental to others, or for administrative purposes.

If not presented separately in the statement of comprehensive income, the financial statements
shall disclose the amounts of proceeds and cost included in profit or loss that relate to items
produced that are not an output of the entity’s ordinary activities, and which line item(s) in the
statement of comprehensive income include(s) such proceeds and cost.

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

    - Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020:

IFRS 1: Subsidiary as a first-time Adopter—The amendment provides additional relief to a
subsidiary which becomes a first-time adopter later than its parent in respect of accounting for
cumulative translation differences. The amendment allows entities that have measured their assets
and liabilities at carrying amounts recorded in their parent’s books to also measure any
cumulative translation differences using the amounts reported by the parent. This amendment
will also apply to associates and joint ventures that have taken the same IFRS 1 exemption.

IFRS 9: Fees in the ‘10 per cent’ test for derecognition of financial liabilities—The amendment
clarifies which fees should be included in the 10% test for derecognition of financial liabilities.

IFRS 16: The amendment removes the illustration of the reimbursement of leasehold
improvements.

**Basis of consolidation**

_Subsidiaries_

Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The
Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement
with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.

Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.

The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations, except acquisitions
under common control which are outside the scope of IFRS 3. The consideration transferred for the
acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former
owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes
the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable
assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured
initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the
acquiree on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s
proportionate share of the recognised amounts of acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related
costs are expensed as incurred.

If the business combination of a subsidiary or joint venture is achieved in stages, the acquisition
date carrying value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re-measured to fair
value at the acquisition date; any gains or losses arising from such re-measurement are recognised in profit
or loss.

Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the Group is recognised at fair value at the
acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be
an asset or liability is recognised in accordance with IFRS 9 in the profit or loss. Contingent consideration
that is classified as equity is not re-measured, and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.

Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group
companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated.

Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for
as equity transactions—that is, as transactions with the owners in their capacity as owners. The difference
between fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net
assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are
also recorded in equity.

When the Group ceases to have control any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair
value at the date when control is lost, with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. The


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained
interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognised in
other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed
of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive
income are reclassified to profit or loss.

_Special purpose entities (“SPE”)_

An SPE is consolidated if, based on an evaluation of the substance of its relationship with the
Group and the SPE’s risks and rewards, the Group concludes that it controls the SPE. The Group has
established an SPE, INEOS Finance Ireland Limited, for a debt securitisation programme The Group does
not have any direct or indirect shareholdings in this SPE. INEOS Finance Ireland Limited is controlled
by the Group as it was established under terms that impose strict limitations on the decision-making powers
of the SPE’s management that result in the Group receiving the majority of the benefits related to the
SPE’s operations and net assets, being exposed to the majority of risks arising from the SPE’s activities, and
retaining the majority of the residual or ownership risks related to the SPE and its assets. INEOS Finance
Ireland Limited is therefore regarded as an SPE and has been consolidated in these financial statements.

_Associates_

Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally
accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are
accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, the investment is initially
recognised at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the investor’s share of
the profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition. The Group’s investment in associates includes
goodwill identified on acquisition. If the ownership interest in an associate is reduced but significant
influence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive
income is reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate.

The Group’s share of post-acquisition profit or loss is recognised in the income statement, and its
share of post-acquisition movements in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive
income with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the investment. When the Group’s share
of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured
receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive
obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.

The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the
investment in the associate is impaired. If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment
as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value and recognises the
amount adjacent to ‘share of profit/(loss) of associates’ in the income statement.

Profits and losses resulting from upstream and downstream transactions between the Group and
its associate are recognised in the Group’s financial statements only to the extent of unrelated investor’s
interests in the associates. Unrealised losses are eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an
impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of associates have been changed where necessary
to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

_Joint arrangements_

The Group applies IFRS 11 to all joint arrangements. Under IFRS 11 investments in joint
arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures depending on the contractual rights
and obligations of each investor. The Group has assessed the nature of its joint arrangements and determined
them to be joint ventures. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.

Under the equity method of accounting, interests in joint ventures are initially recognised at cost
and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses and
movements in other comprehensive income. When the Group’s share of losses in a joint venture equals or


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

exceeds its interests in the joint ventures (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form
part of the Group’s net investment in the joint ventures), the Group does not recognise further losses, unless
it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint ventures.

Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the
extent of the Group’s interest in the joint ventures. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction
provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of the joint ventures
have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

**Foreign exchange**

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group
entities at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency at the
foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised
in the consolidated income statement except for differences arising on the retranslation of a financial
liability designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation, or qualifying cash flow hedges,
which are recognised in other comprehensive income. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured
in terms of historical cost in a foreign exchange are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the
transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value
are retranslated to the functional currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was
determined.

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments
arising on consolidation, are translated to the Group’s presentational currency, euros, at foreign exchange
rates ruling at the reporting date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at exchange
rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. The Group applies an average rate for the year where this
rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Exchange differences
arising from this translation of foreign operations are taken directly to the translation reserve. They are
recycled into the consolidated income statement upon disposal.

Exchange differences arising from a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign
operation, the settlement of which is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, are considered to
form part of a net investment in a foreign operation and are recognised directly in equity in the translation
reserve. Foreign exchange differences arising on the retranslation of a borrowing designated as a hedge of
a net investment in a foreign operation are recognised directly in other comprehensive income (OCI), in the
translation reserve, to the extent that the hedge is effective. When the hedged part of a net investment is
disposed of, the associated cumulative amount in equity is transferred to profit or loss as an adjustment to
the profit or loss on disposal.

**Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group**

Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet
the following two conditions:

(a) They include no contractual obligation upon the Group to deliver cash or other financial
assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under
conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Group; and

(b) Where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity instruments, it is
either a non-derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the
Company’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company’s
exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its
own equity instruments.

To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial
liability. Where the instrument so classified takes the legal form of the Company’s own shares, the amounts


-----

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

presented in these financial statements for called up share capital and share premium account exclude
amounts in relation to those shares.

**Non-derivative financial instruments**

Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities, trade and
other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.

_Trade and other receivables_

Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value plus transaction costs that are
directly attributable to the acquisition or issue. Subsequent to initial recognition they are tested for
classification as per IFRS 9. If the trade receivables satisfy the criteria for cash flow characteristics test and
business model test as per IFRS 9, then they are recognised at amortised cost. If they do not qualify for
being recognised at amortised cost they are recognised at fair value through profit or loss or at fair value
through other comprehensive income.

_Trade and other payables_

Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value less transaction costs that are directly
attributable to the acquisition or issue. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at amortised
cost using the effective interest method.

_Investments in debt and equity securities_

Investments in debt securities are measured at amortised cost if they meet both of the following
conditions and are not designated as a fair value through profit and loss:

     - The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual
cash flows; and

     - The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

A financial asset is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income only if it meets
both of the following conditions and is not designated as a fair value through profit and loss:

     - The asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting
contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and

     - The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

For investment in equity securities that are not held for trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to
present subsequent changes to fair value in other comprehensive income. The Group makes this election on
an investment-by-investment basis.

All other financial assets, including derivatives, are classified as measured at fair value through
profit and loss. When these investments are derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised
directly in equity is recognised in the income statement. Where these investments are interest-bearing,
interest calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in the income statement. Where no reliable
measurement of fair value is available, investments are stated at historic acquisition cost.

_Cash and cash equivalents_

Cash and cash equivalents comprise of cash balances and call deposits.

_Interest-bearing borrowings_

Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the
effective interest method.

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

_Debt restructuring_

The Group derecognises financial liabilities in accordance with the provisions in IFRS 9. When
debt is modified, the Group analyses the modifications from both a quantitative and qualitative perspective
to determine if the modifications are substantial and meet the IFRS requirements for de-recognition, in
which case the debt is treated as extinguished. All fees paid in connection with a debt extinguishment are
expensed immediately. When a modification is accounted for as a non-substantial modification, associated
fees incurred are deferred as an adjustment to the carrying value of the liability and amortised using the
original effective interest rate.

**Derivative financial instruments and hedging**

_Derivative financial instruments_

Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value. The gain or loss on subsequent
re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement as finance
income or expense. Where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss
depends on the nature of the item being hedged.

**Hedge of net investment of foreign operation**

The Group applied hedge accounting to foreign exchange differences arising on the retranslation
of a foreign currency loan where the loan is designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation
in accordance with IFRS 9.

Most commonly this means that exchange differences arising on retranslation of foreign currency
loans designated as a net investment hedge are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive
income. Gains and losses accumulated in the translation reserve will be recycled to the statement of
comprehensive income when the foreign operation is sold.

When a derivative instrument or a non-derivative financial liability is designated as the hedging
instrument in a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, the effective portion of, for a derivative
changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument or, for a non-derivative, foreign exchange gains and losses
is recognised in OCI and presented in the translation reserve within equity. Any ineffective portion of the
changes in the fair value of the derivative or foreign exchange gains and losses on the non-derivative is
recognised immediately in the income statement. The amount recognised in OCI is reclassified to the income
statement as a reclassification adjustment on disposal of the foreign operation.

**Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated
impairment losses.

Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. Cost may
include the cost of materials, labour and other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to a working
condition for their intended use. Cost may also include the cost of dismantling and removing items and
restoring the site on which they are located.

Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are
accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.

Depreciation is charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment. Depreciation commences
from the date an asset is brought into service. Land and assets in the course of construction are not
depreciated. The estimated useful lives are as follows:

       - Buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 - 40 years

     - Plant and equipment and fixtures and fittings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 - 40 years


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date.

The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Where an indicator of
impairment exists, the Group makes an estimate of the recoverable amount, which is the higher of the asset’s
fair value less cost to sell and value in use. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable
amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.

Assets are derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise
from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of the asset (calculated as
the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying value of the asset) is included in the
consolidated income statement in the period in which the item is derecognised.

**Business combinations, goodwill and intangible assets**

All business combinations are accounted for by applying the Acquisition method, except
acquisitions under common control which are outside the scope of IFRS 3. Goodwill represents amounts
arising on acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.

Acquisitions under common control are accounted for at book value. The difference in the book
value of the assets acquired and consideration paid is recognised in a distributable merger reserve.

Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to groups of
cash-generating units and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment. The cash generating units
within the Group are predominately business units. In respect of equity accounted investees, the carrying
amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment in the investee.

Negative goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised immediately in the consolidated income
statement.

_Intangible assets_

Intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation
and accumulated impairment losses. These intangible assets principally comprise intellectual property
rights, customer relationships, non-compete agreements and license fees.

Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are carried initially at cost. The initial cost is
the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of other consideration given to acquire the assets. An intangible
asset acquired as part of a business combination is recognised separately from goodwill if the asset is
separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably.

_Amortisation_

Amortisation is charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite. Intangible assets with an indefinite
useful life and goodwill are systematically tested for impairment at each reporting date. Other intangible
assets are amortised from the date they are available for use. The estimated useful lives are as follows:

      - Customer relationships . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 - 12 years

      - Intellectual property rights . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 - 15 years

      - Non-compete agreements . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . life of the agreement

      - Licenses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . up to 15 years

These intangible assets are tested for impairment at the end of the reporting period if events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Useful lives are examined
on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

**Research and development**

Expenditure on research activities is recognised in the consolidated income statement as an expense
as incurred.

Expenditure on development activities is capitalised if the product or process is technically and
commercially feasible and the Group intends to and has the technical ability and sufficient resources to
complete development, future economic benefits are probable and if the Group can measure reliably the
expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development. Development activities involve a plan
or design for the production of new or substantially improved products or processes. The expenditure
capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads. Where
regulatory and other uncertainties are such that the criteria are not met, the expenditure is recognised in
the income statement. Other development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense
as incurred. Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and less
accumulated impairment losses.

**Impairment of financial assets**

_Trade and other receivables_

The Group applies the simplified approach when providing for expected credit losses prescribed by
IFRS 9 for its trade receivables and contract assets. This approach requires the Group to recognise the
lifetime expected loss provision for all trade receivables taking in consideration historical as well as forwardlooking information.

Where the Group has assessed the probability of default of a financial asset to be low, the loss
allowance is considered immaterial.

The Group assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses associated with the
financial assets classified at amortised cost at each balance sheet date and adjusts the allowance accordingly.

_Investments in debt and equity securities_

Impairment of equity securities classified as FVOCI are not tested for impairment under IFRS 9.
If the fair value of a debt instrument classified as FVOCI increases and the increase can be objectively
related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in the consolidated income statement,
the impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss.

**Impairment of non-financial assets excluding inventories and deferred tax assets**

The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax
assets are assessed at the end of the reporting period to determine whether there is any indication of
impairment.

For goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life and intangible assets
that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated at the end of the reporting period.

An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating
unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement.

Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the
carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to cash-generating units and then to reduce the carrying amount
of the other assets in the unit on a pro rata basis. A cash generating unit is the smallest identifiable group
of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or
groups of assets.

_Calculation of recoverable amount_

The recoverable amount is the greater of fair value less cost to sell and value in use. In assessing
value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is
determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

_Reversals of impairment_

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.

In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed when there is an indication that the
impairment loss may no longer exist and there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the
recoverable amount.

An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed
the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment
loss had been recognised.

**Inventories**

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, using the first-in first-out or average cost method, and
net realisable value which is defined as the estimated selling price less the estimated cost of completion and
the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Cost includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories,
production or conversion costs and other costs in bringing them to their existing location and condition.
In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads
based on normal operating capacity. Provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving or defective items where
appropriate.

Items owned by the Group that are held on consignment at another entity’s premises are included
as part of the Group’s inventory.

**Commodities**

Contracts that are entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of receipt or delivery of
non-financial items in accordance with the Group’s expected purchase, sale or usage requirements (own-use
contracts) are not accounted for as derivative financial instruments, but rather as executory contracts.

**IFRS 16 Leases**

At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A
contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for
a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the
use of an identified asset, the Group uses the definition of a lease in IFRS 16.

**_Group as a lessee_**

_Right-of-use assets_

The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the
underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated
depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of rightof-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognized and lease payments made at or before the
commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove
the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease
incentives received.

The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the
commencement date to the end of the lease term, unless the lease transfers ownership of the underlying
asset to the Group by the end of the lease term or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group
will exercise a purchase option. In that case the right-of-use asset will be depreciated over the useful life of the
underlying asset, which is determined on the same basis as those of property and equipment. In addition,


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain
remeasurements of the lease liability.

_Lease liabilities_

At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the
present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term, discounted using the interest rate implicit
in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate.

The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), variable lease
payments that depend on an index or a rate (initially measured using the index or rate as at the
commencement date), amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees less any lease incentives
receivable. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be
exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating a lease, if the lease term reflects the Group
exercising the option to terminate. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate
are expensed in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.

The lease liability is subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on
the lease liability (using the effective interest method) and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the
lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a
modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments a change in the
assessment of whether the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an option to purchase the underlying asset,
a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, or if there is a change in the
Group’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee.

When the lease liability is remeasured in this way and there has been no change in the scope of the
lease, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded
in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.

_Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets_

The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to all leases that have a lease term
of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option. The Group also
applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases of assets that are valued below €10,000.
Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised as expense on a straightline basis over the lease term.

**Employee benefits**

The Group operates a number of defined contribution plans and funded and unfunded defined
benefit pension schemes. The Group also provides unfunded early retirement benefits, long service awards
and an incentive plan for certain employees.

The Group provides health care insurance to eligible retired employees and their dependants,
primarily in the United States.

_Defined contribution plans_

A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Group pays fixed
contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the
consolidated income statement as incurred.

_Defined benefit plans_

A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan.
The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefits
is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have


-----

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its
present value, and the fair value of any plan assets (at bid price) are deducted. The liability discount rate is
the yield at the reporting date on AA credit rated bonds denominated in the currency of, and that have
maturity dates approximating to the terms of, the Group’s obligations. The calculation is performed by a
qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.

When the benefits of a plan are amended or curtailed, the portion of the increased or decreased
benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised as an expense immediately in the consolidated
income statement.

Where the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the asset recognised is limited to the
present value of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.

The pension scheme surplus (to the extent that it is recoverable) or deficit is recognised in full.

The movement in the scheme surplus/deficit is split between:

     - cost of sales and administrative expenses,

     - net finance costs and,

    - in net expense recognised directly in equity, the remeasurements of post employment benefit
obligations.

_Short-term benefits_

Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed
as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term
cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this
amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

**Provisions**

A provision is recognised in the consolidated balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or
constructive obligation as a result of a past event, that can be reliably measured and it is probable that an
outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by
discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects risks specific to the liability.

**Share capital**

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new
shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.

**Revenue**

Revenue represents the invoiced value of products and services sold or services provided to third
parties net of sales discounts, value added taxes and duties. Contracts for goods and services are analysed
to determine the distinct performance obligations against which revenue should be recognised. The amount
to be recognised is determined from the standalone selling prices for goods and services, allocated to the
performance obligations. Revenue is recognised when (or as) the performance obligations are satisfied by
transferring a promised good or service to a customer.

The pricing for products sold is determined by market prices (market contracts and arrangements)
or is linked by a formula to published raw material prices plus an agreed additional amount (formula
contracts). Revenue arising from the sale of goods is recognised when the goods are dispatched or delivered
depending on the relevant delivery terms and point at which the control of the good or service is transferred
to the customer.

Services provided to third parties include administrative and operational services provided to other
chemical companies with facilities on our sites and services under tolling arrangements. Under tolling

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

arrangements, customers pay for or provide raw materials to be converted into certain specified products,
for which the Group charges a toll fee. The Group only recognises toll fee as revenue earned under such
arrangements upon shipment of the converted product to the customer as this is the point at which the
control of the service is transferred to the buyer. For all other services, revenue is recognised at a point in
time. There are no arrangements of significance which transfer goods or services over time.

**Government grants**

Government grants are shown in the consolidated balance sheet as deferred income. This income is
amortised on a straight line basis over the same period as the tangible fixed asset to which it relates or the
life of the related project.

**Finance income and expenses**

Interest income and interest expense are recognised in the consolidated income statement as it
accrues, using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised in the consolidated income
statement on the date the entity’s right to receive payments is established. Foreign exchange gains and losses
are reported on a gross basis.

Finance costs comprise interest payable, finance charges on leases, unwinding of the discount on
provisions, net fair value losses on derivatives, net interest on employee benefit liabilities and foreign
exchange losses that are recognised in the consolidated income statement (see foreign exchange accounting
policy).

Finance income comprises interest receivable on funds invested and from related party loans, net
fair value gains on derivatives and foreign exchange gains.

**Taxation**

Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the
consolidated income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in
which case it is recognised in equity.

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted
or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of
previous years.

Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following
temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of
assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination;
and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the
foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or
settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at
the end of the reporting period. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if it is possible that there is a
legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets because they relate to taxes levied by the
same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax
liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.

A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will
be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.

**Segmental analysis**

The Group determines its operating segments in a manner consistent with the internal reporting
provided to the chief operating decision-makers. The chief operating decision-makers are responsible for
allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments. The chief operating decisionmakers are the members of the Executive Committee of the ultimate parent undertaking, INEOS Limited.


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which
it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with
any of the Group’s other components and for which discrete financial information is available. An operating
segment’s operating results are reviewed regularly by the chief operating decision-makers to make decisions
about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance.

The Group’s primary format for segment reporting is based on business segments. The business
segments are determined based on the Group’s management and internal reporting structure and the
aggregation criteria set out in IFRS 8.

Segment results that are reported to the chief operating decision-makers include items directly
attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.

Segment capital expenditure is the total payments made during the period to acquire property,
plant and equipment other than as acquired through business combinations.

**Emission trading scheme**

The Group participates in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. The Scheme encourages companies
to reduce carbon emissions by offering financial incentives if they achieve their annual reduction targets.
If a company reduces emissions beyond their target then the surplus may be traded in the form of emissions
permits.

The incentive money due from the EU Emissions Trading Scheme is recognised in the consolidated
income statement once the reduction targets have been met. The emissions permits allocated under the
Scheme are at nil cost. The Group recognises the revenue from such permits upon their sale to third parties.

The Group accrues for emissions produced. The accrual is measured at the carrying amount of the
emission rights held (nil if granted, otherwise at cost) or, in the case of a shortfall, at the current fair value
of the emission rights needed.

**Exceptional items**

In order to provide readers with a clear and consistent presentation of the underlying operating
performance of the Group’s ongoing business it separately identifies those profits and losses which because
of their size or nature, are outside the normal course of business so are expected to be non-recurring.
This may include the disposal of businesses, the impairment of non-current assets, the cost of restructuring
acquired or existing businesses, site closures and demolition costs, the impact of one off events such as
legal settlements or finance costs relating to call premia and write-off of unamortised debt issue costs
following substantial modification or redemption of debt as exceptional items.

**Accounting standards not applied**

A number of new standards and amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after
1 January 2023 and earlier application is permitted; however, the Group has not early adopted the new or
amended standards in preparing these consolidated financial statements.

The impact of their adoption is being assessed and is not expected to have a material impact on the
Group’s financial statements in the period of initial application. The new standards and amendments are as
follows:

    - IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (effective date 1 January 2023).

    - Amendments to IAS 12: Income taxes—deferred tax related to assets and liabilities arising from
a single transaction (effective date 1 January 2023).

    - Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IFRS Practice Statement 2:
Disclosure of Accounting Policies (effective date 1 January 2023).

    - Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Classification of Liabilities as
Current or Non-current and Non-current Liabilities with Covenants (effective date
1 January 2024).

**2. OPERATING SEGMENTS**

The determination of the Group’s operating segments is based on the business units for which
information is reported to the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker. The Group has three reportable
segments, as described below.

The Group’s Olefins and Polymers business units produce olefins and related products and a broad
range of polymers. The Group’s olefins businesses are focused on ethylene and propylene, which are the
two largest volume olefins globally and are key building blocks for polymers. These olefins are primarily used
as feedstock for the Group’s polymers business. In addition, the Group sells olefins to third party customers
for a variety of industrial and consumer applications, including plastics, rubber and fibre.

    - O&P North America segment—In North America, the Group’s olefins and polymers business
comprises five sites including major facilities in Chocolate Bayou, Texas, and Battleground, Texas.

    - O&P Europe segment—In Europe, the Group owns and operates two major cracker complexes,
in Köln, Germany and Rafnes, Norway. This includes polymers and derivatives units.

    - Chemical Intermediates—This reportable segment is the aggregation, in compliance with
IFRS 8, of a number of different business units with similar economic and other characteristics.
Chemical Intermediates are high-value added chemical products used as key components in a
variety of consumer and industrial products. The Group’s chemical intermediates businesses are
exposed to similar key commodities, namely oil and gas. They produce a range of products
including phenol, alpha olefins, solvents, industrial chemicals and nitriles. The Chemical
Intermediates processes are similar in that they are all capital intensive and based upon processing
and mixing chemical raw materials to produce chemical products for the next stage along the
value chain. The Chemical Intermediates products are distributed on a business-to-business basis
across the world. This is performed using similar conventional methods of pipeline, truck, rail
or ship container depending on the customer location and size of the order. The Chemical
Intermediates customer base is similar in that the customers are generally manufacturers of
consumer and industrial products in developed markets and mature industrial economies.

The accounting policies of all of the reportable segments are as described in Note 1.

Information regarding the operations of each reportable segment is included in the following
tables. Performance is measured based on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and
exceptional items, measured under IFRS (“Segment EBITDA”). A reconciliation to IFRS profit before tax is
presented in the following tables. Segment EBITDA is used to measure performance as management
believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to
other entities that operate within these industries. Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arm’s length
basis. Information regarding segments reviewed by management includes management accounts comprising
the profit or loss, cash flows and other financial and non-financial information used to manage the
business.

Adjustments in the following tables comprise the following items:

    - Elimination of inter-segmental transactions and balances; and

     - The Group’s share of profit/(loss) in respect of the Refining joint venture.

In presenting information on the basis of geographic analysis of segments, segment revenue is
based on the geographical location of customers and geographical locations from which the Group derives
revenues.

Revenues from external customers for each product and service or each group of similar products
and services and a geographic analysis of segment assets are not presented as the necessary information is
not available and the Directors are of the opinion that the cost to develop it would be excessive.

All businesses within the Group typically sell individual cargos based on agreed price with delivery
from the plant or at the customer premise. As such, the revenue is recognised as title passes, at a point in
time, and there are no arrangements of significance which transfer goods or services over time. No significant
contract balances arise. No costs to obtain or fulfil contracts are incurred, and therefore no related assets
arise.

**WL Plastics**

On November 1, 2016 the Group acquired 100% of the shares of WLP Holding Corporation, one
of the largest high density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe manufacturers in North America for an initial
consideration of €162.1 million. The business is headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas with production
facilities in Kentucky, South Dakota, Utah, Texas, and Wyoming. WL Plastics has over 500 million pounds
of annual production capacity and provides HDPE pipe for use in oil, gas, industrial, mining, conduit,
and municipal water and sewer applications. This acquisition forms part of the O&P North America segment.

During the year ended December 31, 2020 the Group paid a further €15.6 million which was the
final instalment of the contingent consideration which was subject to the acquired business achieving
certain targets over a three year period.

**Gemini**

On December 31, 2020, the Group acquired 50% of the ordinary shares in Gemini HDPE LLC
(“Gemini”) from Sasol Chemicals North America LLC for cash consideration of $223.8 million
(€187.3 million). The principal activity of the company is to produce high density polyethylene in La Porte,
Texas, USA under tolling arrangements with its owners who provide the feedstock and pay a fee for this
service. The acquisition increased the Group’s interest in Gemini to 100%. Prior to the acquisition the Group
reflected its 50% interest in Gemini as a joint venture (see Note 12a).

The difference between consideration and net assets acquired has been recognised as goodwill
within intangible assets (see Note 11) and has arisen because of the expected synergies and the ability of
the Group to market the full output of Gemini. The goodwill has been allocated to the O&P North America
reporting segment and is deductible for tax purposes over a period of 15 years.

_Settlement of pre-existing contractual relationship_

INEOS and Gemini are parties to four pre-existing agreements namely, a tolling agreement, a
ground lease, a licensing agreement and an operating contract. At the acquisition date these pre-existing
relationships were effectively settled as part of the acquisition.

The fair value of the agreements at the acquisition date was nil, and consequently there is no
adjustment to the consideration paid or income or cost associated with the settlement of the relationship
reflected in the Group financial statements.

_Acquisition related costs_

The Group did not incur any acquisition related costs in connection with the transaction.

Prior to the acquisition date, the Group’s interest in the Gemini joint venture was accounted for in
accordance with the equity method of accounting. As a result of the acquisition the previously held interest
of 50% has been disposed of for a fair value of €187.3 million ($223.8 million), being the equivalent of the
value paid to Sasol for their 50% shareholding. Therefore, the gain on the previously held equity interest in
Gemini has been calculated as follows:

**_Exceptional cost of sales_**

The Group recognised an exceptional impairment charge of €118.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020 in relation to plant and equipment following the Group’s decision to terminate work on
a propane dehydrogenation unit and associated infrastructure at its site in Antwerp, Belgium (see Note 10).

**_Exceptional administrative expense/(gain)_**

In December 2019 the Group took the decision to close the Nitriles facility at Seal Sands, United
Kingdom. Poor operating performance and uneconomic capital expenditure requirements to meet safety
and environmental obligations led to the decision. During the year ended December 31, 2021 an exceptional
administrative gain of €8.9 million was credited to the income statement following the final true up of the
original closure cost provision made in December 2019 as a result of lower than expected demolition costs.

An exceptional administrative expense of €4.2 million has been charged during 2022 (2021: nil,
2020: €8.9 million), which related to a provision for early retirement costs as part of a restructuring of the
Köln site within the O&P Europe business (see Note 21).

**_Exceptional finance costs_**

In November 2021 following the early redemption of the Senior Notes due 2024, an exceptional
finance cost of €3.5 million was recognised following the write-off of deferred issue costs associated with
the redeemed Notes.

**11. INTANGIBLE ASSETS (continued)**

**_Amortisation charge_**

The amortisation charge is recognised in administrative expenses in the consolidated income
statement.

**_Impairment_**

Goodwill has been allocated to cash generating units (CGU) or groups of cash generating units as
follows:

**2022** **2021** **2020**
**€m**
O&P Europe . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 246.2 246.2 246.2

The recoverable amount is based on the value in use of each CGU based on the latest board
approved five year plan. The forecasts are based on current performance and management’s assumptions
regarding the future development of individual parameters including raw material prices and profit margins,
utilising available market pricing forecasts. Future assumptions regarding market demand are based on
external macroeconomic sources and specific data relevant to the petrochemical industry and management’s
knowledge of the local markets in which it operates.

The cash flows after the plan period are based on an average of each of the years in the five year
plan to take account of the cyclical nature of the industry extrapolated using long term growth rates as set
out in the table below.

No impairment charge has been recorded in these financial statements as a result of the annual
impairment test.

The key assumptions underlying the value in use calculation for all CGUs are shown below:

**2022** **2021** **2020**
Period on which management approved forecasts are based . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 years 5 years 5 years
Discount rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11.3% 8.5% 8.5%
Growth rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3.0% 3.0% 3.0%

A terminal value is calculated based on the average cash flows over the five year forecasting period
assuming compound growth of 3% and is discounted over the expected lives of the assets of 40 years.

When determining the discount rate the pre-tax weighted average cost of capital of the Group is
considered at each respective period end.

The growth rate used includes inflationary growth across our various markets.

The estimated recoverable amount exceeded the carrying amount for all cash generating units.

Sensitivity analysis on the recoverable amount was performed based on a 10% increase in the
discount rate and a 10% decrease to the growth rate and a CGU earnings before interest, tax, depreciation
and amortisation and exceptional items, measured under IFRS, all of which are considered a reasonable
possible change in estimate. Neither of these changes resulted in the recoverable amount being lower than
the carrying amount.

**_Joint ventures_**

On July 1, 2011 the group restructured the Refining business into a new joint venture between
PetroChina and INEOS Investments (Jersey) Limited (‘II(J)L’), a related party. II(J)L is held under
common control by our controlling shareholders. The consideration received by the Group for the disposal
consisted of cash consideration of $1.015 billion received from PetroChina for a 50% interest in the
business and an investment in non-voting ordinary shares in II(J)L for the other 50% interest in the business.

During December 2022 the Group disposed of its non-voting ordinary shares in II(J)L to INEOS
Limited, a related party for €420 million (see Note 28). The difference of €270.6 million between the
carrying value of the Refining joint venture and the consideration received, along with the recycling of
foreign exchange movements of €40.6 million previously reported within other comprehensive income have
been recognised within the consolidated income statement.

Before its disposal the Group retained an economic interest in the Refining business by virtue of its
investment in II(J)L. The results of the Refining business were reported within the share of profit/(loss) of
associates and joint ventures using the equity accounting method by virtue of the Group’s effective control of
II(J)L.

In July 2014 the Group set up a new joint venture entity (Gemini HDPE LLC) with Sasol to build
and operate an HDPE plant at the Battleground site in Texas, USA. The Gemini plant became fully
operational in the fourth quarter of 2017. During 2018 €12.9 million was invested into the joint venture. On
December 31, 2020 the Group acquired the remaining 50% interest in the joint venture to become the
100% owner of the plant which resulted in the disposal of the Group’s previous 50% equity accounted interest
of €109.0 million and a gain on disposal of €78.3 million (see Note 3).

In October 2020 the Group invested €1.6 million into a joint venture set up with a Chinese partner
to jointly develop Acrylonitrile technology for use within the Chinese market, and to protect against
mis-use of technology where appropriate. During 2021 the Group invested a further €3.3 million into the
joint venture.

In December 2022 the Group acquired 50% of Shanghai SECCO Petrochemical Company Limited
(“SECCO”) from Sinopec. SECCO operates a petrochemical facility near Shanghai, China which has a
total capacity of 4.2 million tonnes of products including ethylene, propylene, polyethylene, polypropylene,

$525.0 million term loan facility which matures in June 2026 (see Note 18).

an effective date of November 30, 2022, so the Group no longer has any economic interest in the Refining business.

assets of the subsidiaries.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit
through future taxable profits is probable based on an assessment of expected future profits modelled
against the gross unused tax losses, deductible temporary differences and unused tax credits. The Group did
not recognise gross deductible temporary and tax losses of €525.1 million (2021: €606.6 million, 2020:
€123.8 million) due to uncertainty in respect of the existence of future probable taxable profits against which
these tax attributes can be utilised. As at 31 December 2022 there are also net unrecognised unprovided
foreign tax credits of €5.0 million (2021: €37.9 million, 2020: €32.7 million).

The Group has not provided deferred tax in relation to temporary differences on its overseas
subsidiaries or joint ventures as the Group can control the timing and realisation of these temporary
differences, and it is probable that no material unprovided tax liability would arise.

customers (see Note 24c). At December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 there were no significant trade, related
party or other receivable balances not past due that were subsequently impaired.

Due to the global activities and diversified customer structure of the Group, there is no significant
concentration of credit risk (2021: nil, 2020: nil).

During 2020, 2021 and 2022 there were no significant trade, related party or other receivable
balances that were subject to renegotiation of terms. Credit enhancements are held in respect of trade and
other receivables in the form of €62.6 million (2021: €16.1 million 2020: €nil) of assets pledged as security
against amounts owed to the Group of which €0.3 million (2021: €nil, 2020: €nil) is in respect of amounts
falling overdue.

Trade receivable balances totalling €979.0 million (2021: €1,300.2 million, 2020: €776.4 million)
have been pledged as security against amounts drawn down under the Receivables Securitisation Facility,
described in Note 18, totalling €18.9 million (2021: €18.0 million, 2020: €114.2 million). In accordance with
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ the trade receivable balances pledged as security do not qualify for
derecognition and are included within the trade receivable balances above.

The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables during the year was

The allowance account for trade receivables is used to record any impairment losses unless the
Group is satisfied that no recovery of the amount owing is probable; at that point the amounts considered
irrecoverable are written off against the trade receivables directly.

The credit risk grade is based on the analysis on both the quantitative and qualitative factors as
detailed below:

    - High: Customers under significant financial difficulty and customers for whom there is an
uncertainty of payment based on knowledge of factors like insolvency, dispute. Any receivable
more than 180 days past due should also be classified in this category.

    - Medium: Any receivable between 90 and 180 days past due should be classified as medium risk
unless qualitative factors indicate a higher credit risk.

     - Low: Any receivable less than 90 days past due should be classified as low risk unless qualitative
factors indicate a higher credit risk.

During the year the Group has not experienced a significant deterioration in the quality of
receivable balances due to the current economic conditions.

**_Senior Secured Term Loans_**

The Group has outstanding borrowings under a senior credit facilities agreement dated April 27,
2012 (as amended and restated) which consists of euro and US dollar denominated Term Loans (referred
to as the ‘Senior Secured Term Loans’ or ‘Term Loans’).

In November 2022 the Group extended its maturity profile by issuing new Senior Secured Term
Loan maturing in November 2027, consisting of €800 million of euro denominated Term Loans and
$1.2 billion of US dollar denominated Term Loans which were used to partially redeem the euro and US
dollar denominated Term Loans maturing on March 31, 2024. In November 2021 the Group raised
€1.1 billion of additional Senior Secured Term Loans which were used to fully redeem the outstanding
Senior Notes due 2024. These Senior Secured Term Loans mature on November 8, 2028 and consisted of
$845 million of US dollar denominated Term Loans and €350 million of euro denominated Term Loans. In
October 2020 the Group issued euro denominated Senior Secured Term Loans of €375 million which
mature on October 27, 2027. As at December 31, 2022 the Group also had euro and US dollar denominated
Term Loans maturing on March 31, 2024, which were fully redeemed in February 2023 (see Note 31).

The Senior Secured Term Loans outstanding at December 31, 2022 before issue costs were
€5,424.7 million (2021: €4,851.1 million, 2020: €3,682.3 million) of which €56.3 million (2021: €44.7 million,

2020: €37.8 million) is due within one year. The total amounts outstanding on the euro denominated Term
Loans were €2,770.9 million and the US dollar denominated Term Loans were €2,653.8 million.

The Term Loans are to be repaid in equal quarterly instalments, in aggregate annual amounts equal
to 1% of the original principal amount of the Term Loans up to the final maturity date, apart from the
euro denominated Term Loans maturing in November 2027 and November 2028 which have no repayments
until maturity. The €800 million euro denominated Term Loans and $1.2 billion US dollar denominated
Term Loans issued in November 2022 mature on November 8, 2027. The $845 million US dollar denominated
Term Loans and €350 million of euro denominated Term Loans issued in November 2021 mature on
November 8, 2028, whilst the €375 million euro denominated Senior Secured Term Loans issued in
October 2020 mature on October 27, 2027. As at December 31, 2022 the remaining Term Loans were due
to mature on March 31, 2024; however in February 2023 these loans were fully redeemed (see Note 31).

The outstanding Term Loans denominated in US dollars bear interest at a rate per annum equal to
SOFR plus 0.10% (with the $845 million US dollar denominated Term Loans maturing in November 2028
being subject to a floor of 0.50% per annum) plus the Applicable Margin. All of the Term Loans denominated
in euros bear interest at a rate per annum equal to EURIBOR subject to a floor of 0.5% per annum plus
the Applicable Margin.

As at December 31, 2022 the Applicable Margin for the euro denominated Term Loans and the US
dollar denominated Term Loans maturing March 2024 was 2.00%, for the euro denominated Term Loans
maturing October 2027 and November 2028 it was 2.75%, for the US dollar denominated Term Loans
maturing November 2028 it was 2.50%, for the euro denominated Term Loans maturing November 2027
it was 4.00% and for the US dollar denominated Term Loans maturing November 2027 it was 3.75%.

The Senior Secured Term Loans rank pari passu with the Senior Secured Notes due May 2026,
Senior Secured Notes due March 2026 and the Senior Secured Notes due 2025. The Term Loans are
guaranteed by INEOS Group Holdings S.A., INEOS Holdings Limited and certain of their subsidiaries on
a senior secured basis. The Term Loans and the guarantees are secured by first ranking liens on the same
assets (subject to certain exceptions) that secure INEOS Holdings Limited’s obligations under the senior
secured notes.

The Term Loans have numerous customary operating and financial incurrence covenants all of
which have been complied with during the year, including covenants relating to, among other things,
limitations on indebtedness, ability to give guarantees, creation of security interests, making acquisitions
and investments, disposing of assets and paying dividends. The Term Loans have no financial maintenance
covenants.

The Senior Secured Term Loans are stated net of debt issue costs of €95.0 million (2021:
€21.5 million, 2020: €14.6 million). These costs are allocated to the profit and loss account over the term of
the Term Loans.

In February 2023 the Group issued new Senior Secured Term Loans and Senior Secured Notes.
The Senior Secured Term Loans included €700 million maturing in November 2027 and $1.2 billion
maturing in February 2030. Interest rates are EURIBOR (subject to a floor of 0.50% per annum) plus a
margin of 4.00% and SOFR plus 0.10% plus a margin of 3.50%. Proceeds from the new Senior Secured Term
Loans and Senior Secured Notes were used to fully redeem the euro and US dollar denominated Term
Loans maturing on March 31, 2024 as well as increasing the liquidity of the Group. The outstanding amount

France.

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**20. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (continued)**

The Group’s pension schemes have been disclosed on a geographical basis as those schemes in the
United Kingdom, North America and Other European. Other European principally includes the Group’s
pension plans in Germany, Belgium, France and Switzerland.

The UK defined benefit pension plans were historically final salary in nature, with a normal
retirement age of 60. The majority of the UK plans are either closed to new entrants, or frozen to future
accrual. The plans operate under trust law and are managed and administered by Trustees in accordance with
the terms of each plan’s Trust Deed and Rules and relevant legislation. The contributions paid to the UK
plans are set every three years based on a funding agreement between the company and Trustee after taking
actuarial advice.

The North American pension arrangements consist of two funded plans, both closed to new
entrants and future accrual. Both plans were final salary defined benefit in nature, and the plans’ liabilities
are valued regularly in line with US statutory funding requirements. Around 90% of both plans’ assets are
invested in bond instruments, to closely match the profile of each plans’ liabilities.

The Other European pension arrangements are primarily final salary in nature, the majority of
which remain open to new entrants. The majority of plans in Germany are funded through plan assets
from contractual trust arrangements. There are no legal minimum funding requirements, thus the Group
can decide on any plan contributions considering local conditions and practices. The Swiss benefits are
insured, the Belgian plan assets are held in trust, and the remaining schemes are unfunded with associated
provisions held on the Group’s balance sheet.

**_Pension plan assumptions_**

The principal actuarial assumptions (expressed as weighted averages or ranges) at the year end
were as follows:

**United Kingdom** **North America** **Other European**
**2022** **2021** **2020** **2022** **2021** **2020** **2022** **2021** **2020**

**_Severance and restructuring costs_**

The severance and restructuring costs provision includes €17.6 million relating to the Köln site
following reorganisations within the O&P North business and is expected to be fully utilised by 2029.
During 2022 an exceptional administrative expense of €4.2 million has been charged against the severance
and restructuring costs provision relating to the Köln site within the O&P Europe business (see Note 4).

**_Remediation costs_**

The Group has provided for the cost of remediation works of €14.5 million where there is a legal
or constructive obligation for such work to be carried out. Provisions are established to meet the clean-up
costs of contaminated soil and groundwater, the removal of potentially hazardous substances and rectification
work required to ensure compliance with license to operate obligations. These costs relate mainly to the
Group’s production facilities at the Green Lake site, a pilot plant at the Lavera site and oil and gas wells in
the Giddings Field. The provision only covers items of specific work for which a reasonable estimate can be
determined. By their nature the amounts and timing of any outflows in respect of remediation costs are
difficult to predict.

**_Other provisions_**

Other provisions primarily relates to commercial disputes in respect of licencing agreements and
are expected to be fully utilised within the next year.

**24. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS**

**24a Fair value of financial instruments**

**_Investments in debt and equity securities_**

The fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss is estimated as the present
value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.

Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income are accounted for at fair value
based on the present value of future cash flows where such information is readily available based on the
present value of future cash flows estimated from financial information made available during the year as a
result of a recent transaction in the investment. However, as explained in Note 13, the Group’s financial
assets at fair value through other comprehensive income include certain equity interests which are not quoted
and for which there is no active market. The Group considers that the acquisition cost to be a reasonable
approximation for fair value.

**_Trade and other receivables_**

The carrying amount of trade and other receivables generally approximates to fair value due to
their short maturities. Where settlement is not due in the short term and where the effect is material, fair
value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows discounted at the market rate of interest at the
reporting date.

**_Trade and other payables_**

The carrying amount of trade and other payables generally approximates to fair value due to their
short maturities. Where settlement is not due in the short term and where the effect is material, fair value is
estimated as the present value of future cash flows discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting
date.

**_Cash and cash equivalents_**

The fair value of cash and cash equivalents is estimated as its carrying amount where the cash is
repayable on demand. Where it is not repayable on demand then the fair value is estimated at the present
value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.

**_Interest-bearing borrowings_**

The fair value of the Senior Secured Term Loans and Senior Secured Notes, which after initial
recognition is determined for disclosure purposes only are based on the market yields derived from quotes
obtained at the year end from leading financial institutions. The fair value of the Receivables and Inventory
Securitisation, Rafnes Facility, Köln CoGen Facility, Gemini Facility, Rain Facility and Other loans is the
same as the carrying value before unamortised debt issue costs.

**_Derivative financial instruments_**

The fair value of interest rate swaps and commodity contracts are based on market or broker
quotes.

**24. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)**

The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The
different levels, determined in accordance with IFRS 13 “Fair Value Measurement”, have been defined as
follows:

     - Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

     - Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset
or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and

     - Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable
inputs).

The commodity derivatives are fair valued using rates in quoted markets. There have been no
transfers between any levels in 2022 (2021 and 2020: no transfers between levels).

**24b Net gains and losses from financial instruments**

Net gains and losses from financial instruments comprise the results of valuations, the amortisation
of discounts, the recognition and derecognition of impairment losses, results from the translation of foreign
currencies, interest, dividends and all effects on profit or loss of financial instruments.

Net gains from financial assets measured at amortised cost relate primarily to recognition and
derecognition of impairment losses, results from the translation of foreign currencies and interest income.

Net losses from financial liabilities measured at amortised cost relate primarily to amortisation of
discounts, results from the translation of foreign currencies, interest expense and other financing related
expenses.

The item ‘financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss’ comprise valuation gains and
losses, and only includes gains and losses from instruments which are not designated as hedging instruments
as defined by IFRS 9.

**24c Credit risk**

**_Financial risk management_**

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial
instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from
customers, deposits with financial institutions and derivatives.

Group Treasury policy and objectives in relation to credit risk is to minimize the likelihood that the
Group will experience financial loss due to counterparty failure and to ensure that in the event of a single
loss, the failure of any single counterparty would not materially impact the financial wellbeing of the Group.

**_Trade and other receivables_**

The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each
customer. However, management also considers the demographics of the Group’s customer base, including
the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, as these factors may have an
influence on credit risk. Management considers that there is no geographical concentration of credit risk.
The Group has established a credit policy under which each new customer is analysed individually for
creditworthiness before the Group’s standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered or are
adjusted accordingly. The Group’s review includes external ratings, when available, and in some cases
bank references. Purchase limits are established for each customer, which represent the maximum open
amount without requiring approval. Customers that fail to meet the Group’s benchmark creditworthiness
may transact with the Group only on a prepayment basis.

**_Investments, cash and cash equivalent_**

Surplus cash investments are only made with banks with which the Group has a relationship.

**_Guarantees_**

The Group’s policy is to provide financial guarantees only to wholly-owned subsidiaries. At
December 31, 2022 no guarantees were outstanding (2021: none, 2020: none).

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**24. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)**

**_Exposure to credit risk_**

The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. Therefore, the
maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was the carrying amount of financial assets. Further
details on the Group’s exposure to credit risk are given in Note 17.

**24d Liquidity risk**

**_Financial risk management_**

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall
due. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have
sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under normal and stressed conditions, without incurring
unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group. The Group’s exposure to liquidity risk is limited by
the fact that it operates with significant cash resources, and it maintains the most appropriate mix of short,
medium and long-term borrowings from the Group’s lenders.

The Group is reliant on committed funding from a variety of sources at Group and subsidiary
company level to meet the anticipated needs of the Group for the period covered by the Group’s budget.

The Group forecasts on a regular basis the expected cash flows that will occur on a weekly and
monthly basis. This information is used in conjunction with the weekly reporting of actual cash balances at
bank in order to calculate the level of funding that will be required in the short and medium term. On a
monthly basis the level of headroom on existing facilities is reported and forecast forward until the end of
the financial period.

In addition, the Group maintains various lines of credits in the form of Senior Secured Notes,
Senior Secured Term Loans, Securitisation, Rafnes Facility, Köln CoGen Facility, Gemini Facility, Rain
Facility, Project One Facility and Other loans. (See Note 18—“Interest-Bearing Loans and Borrowings” for
more information).

**24. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)**

**24e Net investment and cash flow hedges**

The Group does not have derivative commodity contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges at
December 31, 2022.

The Group has US$ and Sterling financial liabilities in respect of the Senior Notes and Securitisation
Facility that are designated net investment hedges of US$ and Sterling operations in accordance with the
requirements of IFRS 9. The US$ and Sterling net investment hedges had a carrying value and fair value as
follows:

**Carrying** **Carrying** **Carrying**
**amounts** **Fair value** **amounts** **Fair value** **amounts** **Fair value**

**(505.0)** **(511.1)** **(17.8)** **(18.0)** **(518.1)** **(527.0)**

For the year ended December 31, 2022 gains net of tax of €193.5 million were taken directly to
reserves and reported in the Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year then ended (2021: gains
€479 2 million, 2020: losses €527.4 million). There was no ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement
for the year ended December 31, 2022 (2021: €nil, 2020: €nil). The cumulative net investment hedge
reserve amount as at December 31, 2022 was €636.2 million (2021: €442.7 million, 2020: €(36.5) million).

**24f Market risk**

**_Financial risk management_**

Market risk reflects the possibility that changes in market prices, such as crude oil, feedstock
refined products, chemicals or currency exchange rates or changes in interest rates will adversely affect the
value of the Group’s assets, liabilities or expected future cash flows. The Group holds commodity and interest
rate swap contracts in order to manage market risk. The use of derivative instruments is confined to
specialist teams that have the appropriate skills, experience, supervision, control and reporting systems.

**_Market risk—Foreign currency risk_**

The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various
currency exposures, primarily with respect to the U.S. Dollar and Sterling.

Foreign exchange risk arises from net investments in foreign operations, future commercial
transactions, and recognised assets and liabilities.

The Group applies hedge accounting to foreign currency differences arising on the retranslation of
a financial liability designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. When the settlement of
a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation is neither planned nor likely in the
foreseeable future, foreign exchange gains and losses arising from such a monetary item is considered to
form part of a net investment in a foreign operation and changes in the fair value are recognised directly
within equity.

A substantial portion of the Group’s revenue is generated in, or linked to, the U.S. dollar and the
euro. In the European petrochemical business, product prices, certain feedstock costs and most other costs
are denominated in euro and sterling. In the U.S. petrochemical and specialty chemicals businesses, product
prices, raw materials costs and most other costs are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars.

The Group generally does not enter into foreign currency exchange instruments to hedge foreign
currency transaction exposure, although the Group has done so in the past and may do so in the future.

The Group benefits from natural hedging, to the extent that currencies in which net cash flows are
generated from the Group’s operations, are matched against long-term indebtedness.

change occurred at the reporting date and had been applied to risk exposures existing at that date.

This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular other exchange rates and interest rates,
remain constant. The analysis is performed on the same basis for the comparative years.

**_Sensitivity analysis_**

A change of 1% in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased/(decreased) equity and
profit or loss by the amounts shown below. This calculation assumes that the change occurred at the
reporting date and had been applied to risk exposures existing at that date.

This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant
and considers the effect of financial instruments with variable interest rates, financial instrument at fair
value through profit or loss or available for sale with fixed interest rates and the fixed rate element of interest
rate caps. The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2022, 2021 and 2020.

Loss on increase in interest rates by 1% . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (41.5) (36.0) (33.0)

A 1% change in the opposite direction of the above interest rates at December 31, would have had
the equal but opposite effect on the above currencies to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all
other variables remain constant.

**_Market risk—Commodity price risk_**

This section discusses the Group’s exposure to the commodity contracts which are not covered
under the own use exemption and are recognised as derivative instruments.

The Group and its Refining joint venture are exposed to commodity price risk through fluctuations
in raw material prices and sales of products. The raw material exposures result primarily from the price of
crude oil and base chemicals linked to the price of crude. The sales price exposures are primarily related to
petrochemicals where prices are in general linked to the market price of crude oil.

The Group enters into contracts to supply or acquire physical volumes of commodities at future
dates during the normal course of business that may be considered derivative contracts. Where such
contracts exist and are in respect of the normal purchase or sale of products to fulfil the Group’s
requirements, the own use exemption from derivative accounting is applied.

The Group manages commodity price exposures through trading refined products and chemical
feedstock and using commodity swaps, options and futures as a means of managing price and timing risks.
In 2022 there was a net mark to market derivative liability in respect of commodity contracts of €5.7 million
entered into by the Group to manage such risk (2021: net derivative asset of €20.0 million, 2020: net derivative
liability of €57.6 million).

The Group operates within procedures and policies designed to ensure that risks, including those
relating to the default of counterparties, are minimised.

**_Market risk—Equity price risk_**

The Group’s exposure to equity price risk arises from its investment in equity securities which are
classified as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income. These financial assets are
accounted for at fair value based on the present value of future cash flows where such information is readily
available.

For the financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income a 10 percent increase and
decrease in transaction prices at the reporting date would have decreased and increased the loss for the year
by €2.8 million (2021: €2.8 million, 2020: €2.8 million). Management consider that a change of 10 percent
gives an appropriate benchmark to assess the risks that the Group is expected to be exposed to. This calculation
assumes that the change occurred at the reporting date and had been applied to risk exposures existing at
that date. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.

**Capital management**

The Group’s objectives for managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a
going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to
maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

The Group defines its capital employed of €11,636.1 million (2021: €8,986.2 million, 2020:
€7,701.2 million) as shareholders’ equity of €5,521.4 million (2021: €3,353.0 million, 2020: €1,461.6 million)
and net debt (net of debt issue costs) of €6,114.7 million (2021: €5,633.2 million, 2020: €6,239.6 million).

The principal sources of debt available to the Group at December 31, 2022 include the Senior
Secured Term Loans, Senior Secured Notes due March 2026, Senior Secured Notes due May 2026, Senior
Secured Notes due 2025, Receivables Securitisation Facility, Inventory Financing Facility, Rafnes Facility,
Köln CoGen Facility, Gemini Facility and the Rain Facility and are described in Note 18 along with the
key operating and financial covenants that apply to these facilities.

In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends
paid to shareholders, issue new shares, raise new debt or sell assets to reduce debt. The ability of the Group
to pay dividends and provide appropriate facilities to the Group is restricted by the terms of principal
financing agreements to which members of the Group are party.

The Group has entered into a number of significant lease arrangements relating to shipping
capacity in respect of the supply chain activities for the European cracker assets. These leases typically run
for a period of between 10 and 15 years with options to extend after that date.

The Group does not face a significant liquidity risk with regard to its lease liabilities. Lease
liabilities are monitored within the Group’s treasury function.

On 4 May 2012, the Group entered into an on-demand letter of credit facility (the “LC Facility”)
with Barclays Bank PLC (the “Issuing Bank”), under which the Group may request the Issuing Bank to
issue letters of credit, guarantees, performance bonds and indemnities (or any other instrument in a form
agreed by the Issuing Bank) (“LC Utilizations”), the outstanding aggregate base currency amount of which
is not more the €300 million. Under the terms of the LC Facility, the Company undertakes to provide
cash collateral in an amount at least equal to the aggregate of 100% of the maximum actual and/or contingent
liability of the Issuing Bank under each outstanding LC Utilizations (or 105%, to the extent cash cover is
provided in a currency other than the currency of an LC Utilization) standing to the credit of an account or
certain accounts of the Company which are subject to a lien in favour of the Issuing Bank.

undertaking at December 31, 2022 was INEOS Limited, a company registered in the Isle of Man. The
ultimate controlling party is Mr JA Ratcliffe, director and majority shareholder of the ultimate parent
undertaking. INEOS Group Holdings S.A. and its subsidiaries are not included within any other consolidated
financial statements.

**30. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS**

The Group prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRSs, which require
management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions which affect the application of the accounting
policies, and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ
from these estimates. The estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to
accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates change and in any future periods.

**Key sources of estimated uncertainty**

Estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that the
Group believe are reasonable, including assets and expected economic conditions, and in certain cases

**30. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS (continued)**

actuarial assumption. Although these estimates are based on the Group’s knowledge of current events and
circumstances, actual numbers may differ.

**_Post-retirement benefits_**

The Group operates a number of defined benefit post-employment schemes. Under IAS 19
Revised Employee Benefits, management is required to estimate the present value of the future defined
benefit obligation of each of the defined benefit schemes. The costs and year end obligations under defined
benefit schemes are determined using actuarial valuations. The actuarial valuations involve making
numerous assumptions, including:

     - Future rate of increase in salaries;

     - Inflation rate projections;

     - Discount rate for scheme liabilities; and

    - Expected rates of return on the scheme assets.

Details of post-retirement benefits are set out in Note 20.

**31. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS**

In February 2023 the Group issued new Senior Secured Term Loans and Senior Secured Notes.
The Senior Secured Term Loans included €700 million maturing in November 2027 and $1.2 billion
maturing in February 2030. Interest rates are EURIBOR (subject to a floor of 0.50% per annum) plus a
margin of 4.00% and SOFR plus 0.10% plus a margin of 3.50%. The Senior Secured Notes consisted of
€400 million and $425 million and mature in May 2028 and are listed on the Euro MTF—Luxembourg Stock
Exchange. Interest rates are 6.625% and 6.750% respectively. Proceeds were used to fully redeem the
remaining Term Loans due 2024 as well as increasing the liquidity of the Group. The outstanding amount
of Senior Secured Term Loans maturing March 2024 at December 31, 2022 before issue costs was
€1,996.0 million (see Note 18).

In February 2023 the Group received certain guarantees which meant it could start drawing under
the Project One Facility (see Note 18). The Group expects the Project One Facility to be drawn in stages,
beginning in the first quarter of 2023 and throughout the construction period to the end of 2026.

In August 2022, the Group agreed to acquire the entire asset base of Mitsui Phenols Singapore Ltd
from Mitsui Chemicals for approximately $330.0 million, which upon completion will add more than 1,000
kta of capacity, including for cumene, phenol, acetone, alpha-methylstyrene and bisphenol A. The
acquisition was subject to competition clearance which was received post year end so completion is expected
to occur by the end of the first quarter of 2023.

**REPORT OF THE REVISEUR D’ENTREPRISES AGREE**

**Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements**

**Opinion**

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of INEOS Group Holdings S.A. and its
subsidiaries (the “Group”), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at December 31, 2021, and
the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated
statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes
to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the
consolidated financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2021, and its consolidated financial
performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.

**Basis for Opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Law of July 23, 2016 on the audit profession (Law
of July 23, 2016) and with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) as adopted for Luxembourg by the
“Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier” (CSSF). Our responsibilities under the Law of July 23,
2016 and ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF are further described in the “Responsibilities of
the “réviseur d’entreprises agréé” for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements” section of our
report. We are also independent of the Group in accordance with the International Code of Ethics for
Professional Accountants, including International Independence Standards, issued by the International
Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA Code) as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF together
with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements, and
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities under those ethical requirements. We believe that the audit
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

**Other information**

The Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises
the information stated in the consolidated annual report including the management report but does not
include the consolidated financial statements and our report of the “réviseur d’entreprises agréé” thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we
do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read
the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent
with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to
be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report this fact. We have nothing to report in
this regard.

**Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial**
**Statements**

The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated
financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, and for such internal
control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for
assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to
going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends
to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

**Responsibilities of the “réviseur d’entreprises agréé” for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue a
report of the “réviseur d’entreprises agréé” that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level
of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Law of July 23, 2016 and
with ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF will always detect a material misstatement when it
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis
of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with the Law of July 23, 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for
Luxembourg by the CSSF, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism
throughout the audit. We also:

     - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and
obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The
risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting
from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations,
or the override of internal control.

     - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.

    - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors.

    - Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists
related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue
as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw
attention in our report of the “réviseur d’entreprises agréé” to the related disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report of the
“réviseur d’entreprises agréé”. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to
cease to continue as a going concern.

     - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the
underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.


-----

     - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities
and business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial
statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit.
We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal
control that we identify during our audit.

**Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements**

The consolidated management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and
has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

**Overview**

INEOS Group Holdings S.A. (the “Company”) is a company incorporated and domiciled in the
form of a société anonyme under the laws of the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg, having its registered office
at 62 Avenue de la Liberté L-1930, Luxembourg, Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg. The nature of the
operations and principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries are the manufacture and sale of a
range of petrochemical products used in a variety of applications.

**Basis of accounting**

The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together
referred to as the “Group”) and equity account the Group’s interest in associates and joint ventures.

The Group continues to implement contingency plans for the COVID-19 pandemic, with the
primary objective of maintaining the safety of personnel and the reliable operation of the Group’s plants.

The chemical industry is deemed as essential, critical infrastructure by governments across the
world. Throughout the pandemic all of the Group’s plants have continued to operate fully and supply
chains have operated without significant disruption. Protecting employees and ensuring that they remain
healthy has been the first priority of the Group. All plants have sufficient resources and have implemented
measures to ensure that this remains the case throughout the pandemic.

Whilst there is still uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic the Directors have undertaken a
rigorous assessment of the potential impact of COVID-19 on demand for the Group’s products and
services and the impact on margins for the next 12 months.

The Group meets its day to day working capital requirements through its cash generation from
Group operations. The Group held cash balances of €2,106.1 million at 31 December 2021 (2020:
€1,342.2 million, 2019: €982.9 million) and interest-bearing loans and borrowings of €7,739.3 million at
31 December 2021 (2020: €7,581.8 million, 2019: €6,852.8 million). The Directors have considered the
Group’s projected future cash flows and working capital requirements and are confident that the Company
has sufficient cashflows to meet its working capital requirements for the next twelve months from the date
of signing the financial statements. In particular, the Directors have stress tested the forecasts through taking
account of reasonable possible changes in trading performance on the impact on EBITDA, cash flow and
debt. The stress tests show that the Group will still have sufficient cash flow to meet all of its obligations as
they fall due within the next 12 months from the date of signing the financial statements.

On the basis of this assessment together with net assets of €3,353.0 million as at 31 December 2021
(2020: €1,461.6 million, 2019: €1,456.4 million) and the Group’s ability to meet working capital requirements
through its external financing facilities, along with access to cash generated by its subsidiaries, the Directors
have concluded that the Group can operate within its current facilities without the need to obtain new
ones for a period of at least 12 months from the date of this report and have therefore prepared these financial
statements on a going concern basis.

The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union in response
to the IAS regulation (EC 1606/2002) effective as of 31 December 2021 and have been approved for issuance
by the Board of Directors on 18 March 2022.

The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all
periods presented in these Group financial statements.

**Measurement convention**

The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative financial
instruments, financial instruments classified as fair value through the profit or loss or fair value through
other comprehensive income (FVOCI) which are stated at their fair value.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

**Functional and presentation currency**

These Group financial statements are presented in euro, which is the functional currency of the
majority of operations, with other significant currencies being USD and Sterling. The Group’s primary
products are sold in an international commodities market which is priced and invoiced primarily in euros.

All financial information presented in euro has been rounded to the nearest €0.1 million.

**Changes in accounting policies**

The Group financial statements have been prepared using accounting policies that are consistent
with those of the previous financial year. The Group has adopted the following amendments to accounting
standards for the first time in 2021, with effect from 1 January 2021, although there has been no material
effect on the Group’s financial statements:

    - Amendment to IFRS 16—COVID-19—Related Rent Concessions—beyond 30 June 2021
(effective date 1 April 2021). The amendment introduces an optional practical expedient that
simplifies how a lessee accounts for rent concessions that are a direct consequence of COVID-19.

    - Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7 and IFRS 16: Interest Rate Benchmark Reform—
Phase 2 has been adopted and has been applied retrospectively. The amendments introduce a
practical expedient relating to modifications of financial instruments and lease contracts and
specific hedge accounting requirements which is triggered by a replacement of a benchmark
interest rate in a contract with a new alternative benchmark rate. The details of the accounting
policies are disclosed in Note 1—“Derivative financial instruments and hedging.”

**Basis of consolidation**

_Subsidiaries_

Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The
Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement
with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.

Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.

The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations, except acquisitions
under common control which are outside the scope of IFRS 3. The consideration transferred for the
acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former
owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes
the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable
assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured
initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the
acquiree on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s
proportionate share of the recognised amounts of acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related
costs are expensed as incurred.

If the business combination of a subsidiary or joint venture is achieved in stages, the acquisition
date carrying value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re-measured to fair
value at the acquisition date; any gains or losses arising from such re-measurement are recognised in profit
or loss.

Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the Group is recognised at fair value at the
acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be
an asset or liability is recognised in accordance with IFRS 9 in the profit or loss. Contingent consideration
that is classified as equity is not re-measured, and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group
companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated.

Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for
as equity transactions—that is, as transactions with the owners in their capacity as owners. The difference
between fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net
assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are
also recorded in equity.

When the Group ceases to have control any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair
value at the date when control is lost, with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. The
fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest
as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other
comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of
the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive
income are reclassified to profit or loss.

_Special purpose entities (“SPE”)_

An SPE is consolidated if, based on an evaluation of the substance of its relationship with the
Group and the SPE’s risks and rewards, the Group concludes that it controls the SPE. The Group has
established an SPE, INEOS Finance Ireland Limited, for a debt securitisation programme. The Group does
not have any direct or indirect shareholdings in this SPE. INEOS Finance Ireland Limited is controlled by
the Group as it was established under terms that impose strict limitations on the decision-making powers of
the SPE’s management that result in the Group receiving the majority of the benefits related to the SPE’s
operations and net assets, being exposed to the majority of risks arising from the SPE’s activities, and
retaining the majority of the residual or ownership risks related to the SPE and its assets. INEOS Finance
Ireland Limited is therefore regarded as an SPE and has been consolidated in these financial statements.

_Associates_

Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally
accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are
accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, the investment is initially
recognised at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the investor’s share of
the profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition. The Group’s investment in associates includes
goodwill identified on acquisition. If the ownership interest in an associate is reduced but significant
influence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive
income is reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate.

The Group’s share of post-acquisition profit or loss is recognised in the income statement, and its
share of post-acquisition movements in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive
income with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the investment. When the Group’s share
of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured
receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive
obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.

The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the
investment in the associate is impaired. If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment
as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value and recognises the
amount adjacent to ‘share of profit/(loss) of associates’ in the income statement.

Profits and losses resulting from upstream and downstream transactions between the Group and
its associate are recognised in the Group’s financial statements only to the extent of unrelated investor’s
interests in the associates. Unrealised losses are eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an
impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of associates have been changed where necessary
to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

_Joint arrangements_

The Group applies IFRS 11 to all joint arrangements. Under IFRS 11 investments in joint
arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures depending on the contractual rights
and obligations of each investor. The Group has assessed the nature of its joint arrangements and determined
them to be joint ventures. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.

Under the equity method of accounting, interests in joint ventures are initially recognised at cost
and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses and
movements in other comprehensive income. When the Group’s share of losses in a joint venture equals or
exceeds its interests in the joint ventures (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part
of the Group’s net investment in the joint ventures), the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it
has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint ventures.

Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the
extent of the Group’s interest in the joint ventures. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction
provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of the joint ventures
have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

**Foreign exchange**

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group
entities at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency at the
foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised
in the consolidated income statement except for differences arising on the retranslation of a financial
liability designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation, or qualifying cash flow hedges,
which are recognised in other comprehensive income. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured
in terms of historical cost in a foreign exchange are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the
transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value
are retranslated to the functional currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was
determined.

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments
arising on consolidation, are translated to the Group’s presentational currency, euros, at foreign exchange
rates ruling at the reporting date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at exchange
rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. The Group applies an average rate for the year where this
rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Exchange differences
arising from this translation of foreign operations are taken directly to the translation reserve. They are
recycled into the consolidated income statement upon disposal.

Exchange differences arising from a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign
operation, the settlement of which is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, are considered to
form part of a net investment in a foreign operation and are recognised directly in equity in the translation
reserve. Foreign exchange differences arising on the retranslation of a borrowing designated as a hedge of
a net investment in a foreign operation are recognised directly in other comprehensive income (OCI), in the
translation reserve, to the extent that the hedge is effective. When the hedged part of a net investment is
disposed of, the associated cumulative amount in equity is transferred to profit or loss as an adjustment to
the profit or loss on disposal.

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

**Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group**

Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet
the following two conditions:

(a) They include no contractual obligation upon the Group to deliver cash or other financial
assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under
conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Group; and

(b) Where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity instruments, it is
either a non-derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the
Company’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company’s
exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its
own equity instruments.

To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial
liability. Where the instrument so classified takes the legal form of the Company’s own shares, the amounts
presented in these financial statements for called up share capital and share premium account exclude
amounts in relation to those shares.

**Non-derivative financial instruments**

Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities, trade and
other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.

_Trade and other receivables_

Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value plus transaction costs that are
directly attributable to the acquisition or issue. Subsequent to initial recognition they are tested for
classification as per IFRS 9. If the trade receivables satisfy the criteria for cash flow characteristics test and
business model test as per IFRS 9, then they are recognised at amortised cost. If they do not qualify for
being recognised at amortised cost they are recognised at fair value through profit or loss or at fair value
through other comprehensive income.

_Trade and other payables_

Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value less transaction costs that are directly
attributable to the acquisition or issue. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at amortised
cost using the effective interest method.

_Investments in debt and equity securities_

Investments in debt securities are measured at amortised cost if they meet both of the following
conditions and are not designated as a fair value through profit and loss:

     - The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual
cash flows; and

     - The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

A financial asset is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income only if it meets
both of the following conditions and is not designated as a fair value through profit and loss:

     - The asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting
contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and

     - The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

For investment in equity securities that are not held for trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to
present subsequent changes to fair value in other comprehensive income. The Group makes this election on
an investment-by-investment basis.

All other financial assets, including derivatives, are classified as measured at fair value through
profit and loss. When these investments are derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised
directly in equity is recognised in the income statement. Where these investments are interest-bearing,
interest calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in the income statement. Where no reliable
measurement of fair value is available, investments are stated at historic acquisition cost.

_Cash and cash equivalents_

Cash and cash equivalents comprise of cash balances and call deposits.

_Interest-bearing borrowings_

Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the
effective interest method.

_Debt restructuring_

The Group derecognises financial liabilities in accordance with the provisions in IFRS 9. When
debt is modified, the Group analyses the modifications from both a quantitative and qualitative perspective
to determine if the modifications are substantial and meet the IFRS requirements for de-recognition, in
which case the debt is treated as extinguished. All fees paid in connection with a debt extinguishment are
expensed immediately. When a modification is accounted for as a non-substantial modification, associated
fees incurred are deferred as an adjustment to the carrying value of the liability and amortised using the
original effective interest rate.

**Derivative financial instruments and hedging**

_Derivative financial instruments_

Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value. The gain or loss on subsequent
re- measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement as finance
income or expense. Where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss
depends on the nature of the item being hedged.

**Hedge of net investment of foreign operation**

The Group applied hedge accounting to foreign exchange differences arising on the retranslation
of a foreign currency loan where the loan is designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation
in accordance with IFRS 9.

Most commonly this means that exchange differences arising on retranslation of foreign currency
loans designated as a net investment hedge are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive
income. Gains and losses accumulated in the translation reserve will be recycled to the statement of
comprehensive income when the foreign operation is sold.

When a derivative instrument or a non-derivative financial liability is designated as the hedging
instrument in a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, the effective portion of, for a derivative
changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument or, for a non-derivative, foreign exchange gains and losses
is recognised in OCI and presented in the translation reserve within equity. Any ineffective portion of the
changes in the fair value of the derivative or foreign exchange gains and losses on the non-derivative is
recognised immediately in the income statement. The amount recognised in OCI is reclassified to the income
statement as a reclassification adjustment on disposal of the foreign operation.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

**Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated
impairment losses.

Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. Cost may
include the cost of materials, labour and other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to a working
condition for their intended use. Cost may also include the cost of dismantling and removing items and
restoring the site on which they are located.

Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are
accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.

Depreciation is charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment. Depreciation commences
from the date an asset is brought into service. Land and assets in the course of construction are not
depreciated. The estimated useful lives are as follows:

       - Buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 - 40 years

     - Plant and equipment and fixtures and fittings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 - 40 years

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date.

The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Where an indicator of
impairment exists, the Group makes an estimate of the recoverable amount, which is the higher of the asset’s
fair value less cost to sell and value in use. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable
amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.

Assets are derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise
from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of the asset (calculated as
the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying value of the asset) is included in the
consolidated income statement in the period in which the item is derecognised.

**Business combinations, goodwill and intangible assets**

All business combinations are accounted for by applying the Acquisition method, except
acquisitions under common control which are outside the scope of IFRS 3. Goodwill represents amounts
arising on acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.

Acquisitions under common control are accounted for at book value. The difference in the book
value of the assets acquired and consideration paid is recognised in a distributable merger reserve.

Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to groups of
cash-generating units and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment. The cash generating units
within the Group are predominately business units. In respect of equity accounted investees, the carrying
amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment in the investee.

Negative goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised immediately in the consolidated income
statement.

_Intangible assets_

Intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation
and accumulated impairment losses. These intangible assets principally comprise intellectual property
rights, customer relationships, non-compete agreements and license fees.

Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are carried initially at cost. The initial cost is
the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of other consideration given to acquire the assets. An intangible


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

asset acquired as part of a business combination is recognised separately from goodwill if the asset is
separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably.

_Amortisation_

Amortisation is charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite. Intangible assets with an indefinite
useful life and goodwill are systematically tested for impairment at each reporting date. Other intangible
assets are amortised from the date they are available for use. The estimated useful lives are as follows:

      - Customer relationships. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 - 12 years

      - Intellectual property rights . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 - 15 years

      - Non-compete agreements . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . life of the agreement

      - Licenses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . up to 15 years

These intangible assets are tested for impairment at the end of the reporting period if events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Useful lives are examined
on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis.

**Research and development**

Expenditure on research activities is recognised in the consolidated income statement as an expense
as incurred.

Expenditure on development activities is capitalised if the product or process is technically and
commercially feasible and the Group intends to and has the technical ability and sufficient resources to
complete development, future economic benefits are probable and if the Group can measure reliably the
expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development. Development activities involve a plan
or design for the production of new or substantially improved products or processes. The expenditure
capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads. Where
regulatory and other uncertainties are such that the criteria are not met, the expenditure is recognised in
the income statement. Other development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense
as incurred. Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and less
accumulated impairment losses.

**Impairment of financial assets**

_Trade and other receivables_

The Group applies the simplified approach when providing for expected credit losses prescribed by
IFRS 9 for its trade receivables and contract assets. This approach requires the Group to recognise the
lifetime expected loss provision for all trade receivables taking in consideration historical as well as forwardlooking information.

Where the Group has assessed the probability of default of a financial asset to be low, the loss
allowance is considered immaterial.

The Group assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses associated with the
financial assets classified at amortised cost at each balance sheet date and adjusts the allowance accordingly.

_Investments in debt and equity securities_

Impairment of equity securities classified as FVOCI are not tested for impairment under IFRS 9.
If the fair value of a debt instrument classified as FVOCI increases and the increase can be objectively
related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in the consolidated income statement,
the impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss.


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

**Impairment of non-financial assets excluding inventories and deferred tax assets**

The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax
assets are assessed at the end of the reporting period to determine whether there is any indication of
impairment.

For goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life and intangible assets
that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated at the end of the reporting period.

An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating
unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement.

Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the
carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to cash-generating units and then to reduce the carrying amount
of the other assets in the unit on a pro rata basis. A cash generating unit is the smallest identifiable group
of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or
groups of assets.

_Calculation of recoverable amount_

The recoverable amount is the greater of fair value less cost to sell and value in use. In assessing
value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.

For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is
determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

_Reversals of impairment_

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.

In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed when there is an indication that the
impairment loss may no longer exist and there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the
recoverable amount.

An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed
the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment
loss had been recognised.

**Inventories**

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, using the first-in first-out or average cost method, and
net realisable value which is defined as the estimated selling price less the estimated cost of completion and
the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Cost includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories,
production or conversion costs and other costs in bringing them to their existing location and condition.
In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads
based on normal operating capacity. Provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving or defective items where
appropriate.

Items owned by the Group that are held on consignment at another entity’s premises are included
as part of the Group’s inventory.

**Commodities**

Contracts that are entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of receipt or delivery of nonfinancial items in accordance with the Group’s expected purchase, sale or usage requirements (own-use
contracts) are not accounted for as derivative financial instruments, but rather as executory contracts.


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

**IFRS 16 Leases**

At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A
contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for
a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the
use of an identified asset, the Group uses the definition of a lease in IFRS 16.

**_Group as a lessee_**

_Right-of-use assets_

The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the
underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated
depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of
right- of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognized and lease payments made at or before
the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and
remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease
incentives received.

The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the
commencement date to the end of the lease term, unless the lease transfers ownership of the underlying
asset to the Group by the end of the lease term or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group
will exercise a purchase option. In that case the right-of-use asset will be depreciated over the useful life of the
underlying asset, which is determined on the same basis as those of property and equipment. In addition,
the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain
remeasurements of the lease liability.

_Lease liabilities_

At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the
present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term, discounted using the interest rate implicit
in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate.

The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), variable lease
payments that depend on an index or a rate (initially measured using the index or rate as at the
commencement date), amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees less any lease incentives
receivable. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be
exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating a lease, if the lease term reflects the Group
exercising the option to terminate. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate
are expensed in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.

The lease liability is subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on
the lease liability (using the effective interest method) and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the
lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a
modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments a change in the
assessment of whether the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an option to purchase the underlying asset,
a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, or if there is a change in the
Group’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee.

When the lease liability is remeasured in this way and there has been no change in the scope of the
lease, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded
in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.

_Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets_

The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to all leases that have a lease term
of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option. The Group also


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases of assets that are valued below
€10,000. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised as expense on a
straight-line basis over the lease term.

**Employee benefits**

The Group operates a number of defined contribution plans and funded and unfunded defined
benefit pension schemes. The Group also provides unfunded early retirement benefits, long service awards
and an incentive plan for certain employees.

The Group provides health care insurance to eligible retired employees and their dependants,
primarily in the United States.

_Defined contribution plans_

A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Group pays fixed
contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the
consolidated income statement as incurred.

_Defined benefit plans_

A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan.
The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefits
is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have
earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its
present value, and the fair value of any plan assets (at bid price) are deducted. The liability discount rate is
the yield at the reporting date on AA credit rated bonds denominated in the currency of, and that have
maturity dates approximating to the terms of, the Group’s obligations. The calculation is performed by a
qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.

When the benefits of a plan are amended or curtailed, the portion of the increased or decreased
benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised as an expense immediately in the consolidated
income statement.

Where the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the asset recognised is limited to the
present value of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.

The pension scheme surplus (to the extent that it is recoverable) or deficit is recognised in full.

The movement in the scheme surplus/deficit is split between:

     - cost of sales and administrative expenses,

     - net finance costs and,

    - in net expense recognised directly in equity, the remeasurements of post employment benefit
obligations.

_Short-term benefits_

Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed
as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term
cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this
amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

**Provisions**

A provision is recognised in the consolidated balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or
constructive obligation as a result of a past event, that can be reliably measured and it is probable that an


-----

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by
discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects risks specific to the liability.

**Share capital**

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new
shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.

**Revenue**

Revenue represents the invoiced value of products and services sold or services provided to third
parties net of sales discounts, value added taxes and duties. Contracts for goods and services are analysed
to determine the distinct performance obligations against which revenue should be recognised. The amount
to be recognised is determined from the standalone selling prices for goods and services, allocated to the
performance obligations. Revenue is recognised when (or as) the performance obligations are satisfied by
transferring a promised good or service to a customer.

The pricing for products sold is determined by market prices (market contracts and arrangements)
or is linked by a formula to published raw material prices plus an agreed additional amount (formula
contracts). Revenue arising from the sale of goods is recognised when the goods are dispatched or delivered
depending on the relevant delivery terms and point at which the control of the good or service is transferred
to the customer.

Services provided to third parties include administrative and operational services provided to other
chemical companies with facilities on our sites and services under tolling arrangements. Under tolling
arrangements, customers pay for or provide raw materials to be converted into certain specified products,
for which the Group charges a toll fee. The Group only recognises toll fee as revenue earned under such
arrangements upon shipment of the converted product to the customer as this is the point at which the
control of the service is transferred to the buyer. For all other services, revenue is recognised at a point in
time. There are no arrangements of significance which transfer goods or services over time.

**Government grants**

Government grants are shown in the consolidated balance sheet as deferred income. This income is
amortised on a straight line basis over the same period as the tangible fixed asset to which it relates or the
life of the related project.

**Finance income and expenses**

Interest income and interest expense are recognised in the consolidated income statement as it
accrues, using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised in the consolidated income
statement on the date the entity’s right to receive payments is established. Foreign exchange gains and losses
are reported on a gross basis.

Finance costs comprise interest payable, finance charges on leases, unwinding of the discount on
provisions, net fair value losses on derivatives, net interest on employee benefit liabilities and foreign
exchange losses that are recognised in the consolidated income statement (see foreign exchange accounting
policy).

Finance income comprises interest receivable on funds invested and from related party loans, net
fair value gains on derivatives and foreign exchange gains.

**Taxation**

Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the
consolidated income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in
which case it is recognised in equity.

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted
or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of
previous years.

Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following
temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of
assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination;
and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the
foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or
settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at
the end of the reporting period. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if it is possible that there is a
legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets because they relate to taxes levied by the
same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax
liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.

A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will
be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.

**Segmental analysis**

The Group determines its operating segments in a manner consistent with the internal reporting
provided to the chief operating decision-makers. The chief operating decision-makers are responsible for
allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments. The chief operating decisionmakers are the members of the Executive Committee of the ultimate parent undertaking, INEOS Limited.

An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which
it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with
any of the Group’s other components and for which discrete financial information is available. An operating
segment’s operating results are reviewed regularly by the chief operating decision-makers to make decisions
about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance.

The Group’s primary format for segment reporting is based on business segments. The business
segments are determined based on the Group’s management and internal reporting structure and the
aggregation criteria set out in IFRS 8.

Segment results that are reported to the chief operating decision-makers include items directly
attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.

Segment capital expenditure is the total payments made during the period to acquire property,
plant and equipment other than as acquired through business combinations.

**Emission trading scheme**

The Group participates in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. The Scheme encourages companies
to reduce carbon emissions by offering financial incentives if they achieve their annual reduction targets. If
a company reduces emissions beyond their target then the surplus may be traded in the form of emissions
permits.

The incentive money due from the EU Emissions Trading Scheme is recognised in the consolidated
income statement once the reduction targets have been met. The emissions permits allocated under the
Scheme are at nil cost. The Group recognises the revenue from such permits upon their sale to third parties.

The Group accrues for emissions produced. The accrual is measured at the carrying amount of the
emission rights held (nil if granted, otherwise at cost) or, in the case of a shortfall, at the current fair value
of the emission rights needed.

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

**Exceptional items**

In order to provide readers with a clear and consistent presentation of the underlying operating
performance of the Group’s ongoing business it separately identifies those profits and losses which because
of their size or nature, are outside the normal course of business so are expected to be non-recurring.
This may include the disposal of businesses, the impairment of non-current assets, the cost of restructuring
acquired or existing businesses, site closures and demolition costs, the impact of one off events such as
legal settlements or finance costs relating to call premia and write-off of unamortised debt issue costs
following substantial modification or redemption of debt as exceptional items.

**Accounting standards not applied**

A number of new standards and amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after
1 January 2022 and earlier application is permitted; however, the Group has not early adopted the new or
amended standards in preparing these consolidated financial statements.

The impact of their adoption is being assessed and is not expected to have a material impact on the
Group’s financial statements in the period of initial application. The new standards and amendments are as
follows:

    - Amendments to IAS 37: Onerous Contracts—Cost of Fulfilling a Contract (effective date
1 January 2022).

    - Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS 3 (effective date
1 January 2022).

    - Amendments to IAS 16: Property, Plant and Equipment—Proceeds before Intended Use
(effective date 1 January 2022).

    - Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020 (effective date 1 January 2022).

    - IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (effective date 1 January 2023).

    - Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Classification of Liabilities as
Current or Non-current (effective date 1 January 2023).

    - Amendments to IAS 12: Income taxes—deferred tax related to assets and liabilities arising from
a single transaction (effective date 1 January 2023).

    - Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IFRS Practice Statement 2:
Disclosure of Accounting Policies (effective date 1 January 2023).

    - Amendments to IAS 8: Definition of Accounting Estimates (effective date 1 January 2023).

**2. OPERATING SEGMENTS**

The determination of the Group’s operating segments is based on the business units for which
information is reported to the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker. The Group has three reportable
segments, as described below.

The Group’s Olefins and Polymers business units produce olefins and related products and a broad
range of polymers. The Group’s olefins businesses are focused on ethylene and propylene, which are the
two largest volume olefins globally and are key building blocks for polymers. These olefins are primarily used
as feedstock for the Group’s polymers business. In addition, the Group sells olefins to third party customers
for a variety of industrial and consumer applications, including plastics, rubber and fibre.

    - O&P North America segment—In North America, the Group’s olefins and polymers business
comprises five sites including major facilities in Chocolate Bayou, Texas, and Battleground, Texas.

    - O&P Europe segment—In Europe, the Group owns and operates two major cracker complexes,
in Köln, Germany and Rafnes, Norway. This includes polymers and derivatives units.

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**2. OPERATING SEGMENTS (continued)**

    - Chemical Intermediates—This reportable segment is the aggregation, in compliance with
IFRS 8, of a number of different business units with similar economic and other characteristics.
Chemical Intermediates are high-value added chemical products used as key components in a
variety of consumer and industrial products. The Group’s chemical intermediates businesses are
exposed to similar key commodities, namely oil and gas. They produce a range of products
including phenol, alpha olefins, solvents, industrial chemicals and nitriles. The Chemical
Intermediates processes are similar in that they are all capital intensive and based upon processing
and mixing chemical raw materials to produce chemical products for the next stage along the
value chain. The Chemical Intermediates products are distributed on a business-to-business basis
across the world. This is performed using similar conventional methods of pipeline, truck, rail
or ship container depending on the customer location and size of the order. The Chemical
Intermediates customer base is similar in that the customers are generally manufacturers of
consumer and industrial products in developed markets and mature industrial economies.

The accounting policies of all of the reportable segments are as described in Note 1.

Information regarding the operations of each reportable segment is included in the following
tables. Performance is measured based on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and
exceptional items, measured under IFRS (“Segment EBITDA”). A reconciliation to IFRS profit before tax is
presented in the following tables. Segment EBITDA is used to measure performance as management
believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to
other entities that operate within these industries. Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arm’s length
basis. Information regarding segments reviewed by management includes management accounts comprising
the profit or loss, cash flows and other financial and non-financial information used to manage the
business.

Adjustments in the following tables comprise the following items:

    - Elimination of inter-segmental transactions and balances; and

     - The Group’s share of (loss)/profit in respect of the Refining joint venture.

In presenting information on the basis of geographic analysis of segments, segment revenue is
based on the geographical location of customers and geographical locations from which the Group derives
revenues.

Revenues from external customers for each product and service or each group of similar products
and services and a geographic analysis of segment assets are not presented as the necessary information is
not available and the Directors are of the opinion that the cost to develop it would be excessive.

All businesses within the Group typically sell individual cargos based on agreed price with delivery
from the plant or at the customer premise. As such, the revenue is recognised as title passes, at a point in
time, and there are no arrangements of significance which transfer goods or services over time. No significant
contract balances arise. No costs to obtain or fulfil contracts are incurred, and therefore no related assets
arise.

**3. ACQUISITIONS**

**_Acquisition of businesses in the current year_**

**Charter Plastics**

On December 31, 2021, the Group acquired the assets of Charter Plastics in Titusville, USA which
manufactures high density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe products. The total cash consideration for the assets
was $64.5 million (€56.4 million). This acquisition forms part of the O&P North America reporting segment
and is defined as a business under IFRS 3.

**Difference between consideration and provisional net assets acquired . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **18.1**

The fair values disclosed are provisional due to the proximity of the acquisition to the preparation
of these financial statements so further work may be required to confirm final fair values. The finalisation
of the work to determine the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired will be completed within
12 months of the acquisition date.

The difference between consideration and net assets acquired has been recognised as goodwill
within intangible assets (see Note 11) and has arisen because of the ability of the Group to create product
and market diversification in the Northeast region of the USA. The goodwill has been allocated to the O&P
North America CGU and is deductible for tax purposes over a period of 15 years.

The fair value of acquired trade receivables was €6.6 million. The gross contractual amounts
receivable are €6.6 million, of which none was expected to be uncollectable at the date of acquisition.

_Acquisition related costs_

The Group incurred acquisition related costs in connection with the transaction of €0.1 million
which were charged to administrative expenses in the Group’s consolidated income statement during the
year ended December 31, 2021.

**_Updates to prior years_**

**Gemini**

On December 31, 2020, the Group acquired 50% of the ordinary shares in Gemini HDPE LLC
(“Gemini”) from Sasol Chemicals North America LLC for cash consideration of $223.8 million
(€187.3 million). The principal activity of the company is to produce high density polyethylene in La Porte,
Texas, USA under tolling arrangements with its owners who provide the feedstock and pay a fee for this
service. The acquisition increased the Group’s interest in Gemini to 100%. Prior to the acquisition the Group
reflected its 50% interest in Gemini as a joint venture (see Note 12a).

As Gemini HDPE LLC is a toll manufacturer on behalf of its owners the overall direct impact on
the 2020 Group revenue and profit and loss had the acquisition occurred at the start of 2020 was immaterial.

The fair values assigned to the book values of the identifiable assets and liabilities were reviewed
during the year ended December 31, 2021 which resulted in an update to the net assets acquired. In
addition, the purchase agreement provided for corrections for actual net working capital contributions
compared to target which resulted in a final consideration payment of €0.4 million during the year ended
December 31, 2021.

**Difference between consideration and net assets acquired . . . . . . . . . .** **138.8** **(22.7)** **116.1**


The difference between consideration and net assets acquired has been recognised as goodwill
within intangible assets (see Note 11) and has arisen because of the expected synergies and the ability of
the Group to market the full output of Gemini. The goodwill has been allocated to the O&P North America
reporting segment and is deductible for tax purposes over a period of 15 years.

_Settlement of pre-existing contractual relationship_

INEOS and Gemini are parties to four pre-existing agreements namely, a tolling agreement, a
ground lease, a licensing agreement and an operating contract. At the acquisition date these pre-existing
relationships were effectively settled as part of the acquisition.

The fair value of the agreements at the acquisition date was nil, and consequently there is no
adjustment to the consideration paid or income or cost associated with the settlement of the relationship
reflected in the Group financial statements.

_Acquisition related costs_

The Group did not incur any acquisition related costs in connection with the transaction.

Prior to the acquisition date, the Group’s interest in the Gemini joint venture was accounted for in
accordance with the equity method of accounting. As a result of the acquisition the previously held interest
of 50% has been disposed of for a fair value of €187.3 million ($223.8 million), being the equivalent of the
value paid to Sasol for their 50% shareholding. Therefore, the gain on the previously held equity interest in
Gemini has been calculated as follows:

**WL Plastics**

On November 1, 2016 the Group acquired 100% of the shares of WLP Holding Corporation, one
of the largest high density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe manufacturers in North America for an initial
consideration of €162.1 million. The business is headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas with production
facilities in Kentucky, South Dakota, Utah, Texas, and Wyoming. WL Plastics has over 500 million pounds
of annual production capacity and provides HDPE pipe for use in oil, gas, industrial, mining, conduit,
and municipal water and sewer applications. This acquisition forms part of the O&P North America segment.

During the year ended December 31, 2020 the Group paid a further €15.6 million (2019:
€15.0 million) which was the final instalment of the contingent consideration which was subject to the
acquired business achieving certain targets over a three year period.

**INESCO combined heat and power plant**

On March 1, 2019, the Group acquired 100% of the shares of RWE Generation Belgium NV, the
owner of a Cogeneration unit on the Oxide Antwerp site in Belgium for cash consideration of €70.4 million.
The business consists of two 50MW units and an additional 35MW steam generator. All the steam and
approximately one third of the electricity is consumed by the Group and a number of co-siting companies
on the site in Antwerp. The remainder of the electricity is sold to the Belgian electricity grid, through a short
term marketing contract with the previous owner RWE. This acquisition forms part of the Chemical
Intermediates segment and is defined as a business under IFRS 3.

**3. ACQUISITIONS (continued)**

**_Acquisition of assets in prior years_**

**Shale oil and gas assets**

In April 2019 the Group purchased 104 active oil and gas wells and three non-active oil and gas
wells located in the Giddings Fields in Texas USA. In addition to the purchase of the wells the Group
acquired all acreage associated with each well. The total cash consideration for the assets was €27.2 million
which included €24.4 million in respect of intangible well rights, €2.6 million relating to property, plant
and equipment and €0.2 million relating to inventories.

**_Exceptional cost of sales_**

The Group recognised an exceptional impairment charge of €118.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020 in relation to plant and equipment following the Group’s decision to terminate work on
a propane dehydrogenation unit and associated infrastructure at its site in Antwerp, Belgium (see Note 10).

**_Exceptional administrative (gain)/expense_**

In December 2019 the Group took the decision to close the Nitriles facility at Seal Sands, United
Kingdom. Poor operating performance and uneconomic capital expenditure requirements to meet safety
and environmental obligations led to the decision. As a result, an exceptional administrative charge of
€35.1 million was incurred in 2019 for closure costs including severance and outplacement expenses, together
with decommissioning and demolition costs. In addition, tangible fixed assets at the facility of €33.3 million
were impaired during the year ended December 31, 2019 along with a further €26.2 million impairment
charge in the year ended December 31, 2020 (see Note 10). During the year ended December 31, 2021 an
exceptional administrative gain of €8.9 million was credited to the income statement following the final true
up of the original closure cost provision made in December 2019 as a result of lower than expected
demolition costs.

An exceptional administrative expense of €8.9 million has been charged during 2020, which related
to a provision for early retirement costs as part of a restructuring of the Köln site within the O&P Europe
business.

An exceptional administrative charge of €13.0 million was also incurred during 2019 relating to the
settlement of an intellectual property dispute in respect of the former Technologies business.

**_Exceptional finance costs_**

In November 2021 following the early redemption of the Senior Notes due 2024, an exceptional
finance cost of €3.5 million was recognised following the write-off of deferred issue costs associated with
the redeemed Notes.

In April 2019 following the early redemption of the Senior Secured Notes due 2023, an exceptional
finance cost of €11.7 million was recognised which included an early prepayment premium of €7.7 million
and the write-off of deferred issue costs associated with the redeemed Notes of €4.0 million.

The recoverable amount is based on the value in use of each CGU based on the latest board
approved five year plan. The forecasts are based on current performance and management’s assumptions
regarding the future development of individual parameters including raw material prices and profit margins,
utilising available market pricing forecasts. Future assumptions regarding market demand are based on
external macroeconomic sources and specific data relevant to the petrochemical industry and management’s
knowledge of the local markets in which it operates.

The cash flows after the plan period are based on an average of each of the years in the five year
plan to take account of the cyclical nature of the industry extrapolated using long term growth rates as set
out in the table below.

No impairment charge has been recorded in these financial statements as a result of the annual
impairment test.

The key assumptions underlying the value in use calculation for all CGUs are shown below:

**2021** **2020** **2019**
Period on which management approved forecasts are based . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 years 5 years 5 years
Discount rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8.5% 8.5% 8.5%
Growth rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3.0% 3.0% 3.0%

A terminal value is calculated based on the average cash flows over the five year forecasting period
assuming compound growth of 3% and is discounted over the expected lives of the assets of 40 years.

When determining the discount rate the pre-tax weighted average cost of capital of the Group is
considered at each respective period end.

The growth rate used includes inflationary growth across our various markets.

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**11. INTANGIBLE ASSETS (continued)**

The estimated recoverable amount exceeded the carrying amount for all cash generating units.

Sensitivity analysis on the recoverable amount was performed based on a 10% increase in the
discount rate and a 10% decrease to the growth rate and a CGU earnings before interest, tax, depreciation
and amortisation and exceptional items, measured under IFRS, all of which are considered a reasonable
possible change in estimate. Neither of these changes resulted in the recoverable amount being lower than
the carrying amount.

**_Joint ventures_**

On July 1, 2011 the group restructured the Refining business into a new joint venture between
PetroChina and INEOS Investments (Jersey) Limited (‘II(J)L’), a related party. II(J)L is held under
common control by our controlling shareholders. The consideration received by the Group for the disposal
consisted of cash consideration of $1.015 billion received from PetroChina for a 50% interest in the
business and an investment in non-voting ordinary shares in II(J)L for the other 50% interest in the business.

The Group retains an economic interest in the Refining business by virtue of its investment in
II(J)L. The results of the Refining business are reported within the share of profit/(loss) of associates and
joint ventures using the equity accounting method by virtue of the Group’s effective control of II(J)L. The
Group has no ongoing obligations to fund the Refining business.

In July 2014 the Group set up a new joint venture entity (Gemini HDPE LLC) with Sasol to build
and operate an HDPE plant at the Battleground site in Texas, USA. The Gemini plant became fully
operational in the fourth quarter of 2017. During 2018 €12.9 million was invested into the joint venture. On
December 31, 2020 the Group acquired the remaining 50% interest in the joint venture to become the
100% owner of the plant which resulted in the disposal of the Group’s previous 50% equity accounted interest
of €109.0 million and a gain on disposal of €78.3 million (see Note 3).

In October 2020 the Group invested €1.6 million into a joint venture set up with a Chinese partner
to jointly develop Acrylonitrile technology for use within the Chinese market, and to protect against misuse of technology where appropriate. During 2021 the Group invested a further €3.3 million into the joint
venture.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit
through future taxable profits is probable based on an assessment of expected future profits modelled
against the gross unused tax losses, deductible temporary differences and unused tax credits. The Group did
not recognise gross deductible temporary and tax losses of €606.6 million (2020: €123.8 million, 2019:
€95.9 million) due to uncertainty in respect of the existence of future probable taxable profits against which
these tax attributes can be utilised. As at 31 December 2021 there are also net unrecognised unprovided
foreign tax credits of €37.9 million (2020: €32.7 million).

The Group has not provided deferred tax in relation to temporary differences on its overseas
subsidiaries or joint ventures as the Group can control the timing and realisation of these temporary
differences, and it is probable that no material unprovided tax liability would arise.

customers (see Note 25.c). At December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 there were no significant trade, related
party or other receivable balances not past due that were subsequently impaired.

Due to the global activities and diversified customer structure of the Group, there is no significant
concentration of credit risk (2020: nil, 2019: nil).

During 2019, 2020 and 2021 there were no significant trade, related party or other receivable
balances that were subject to renegotiation of terms. Credit enhancements are held in respect of trade and
other receivables in the form of €16.1 million (2020: €nil, 2019: €nil) of assets pledged as security against
amounts owed to the Group of which €nil (2020: €nil, 2019: €nil) is in respect of amounts falling overdue.

Trade receivable balances totalling €1,300.2 million (2020: €776.4 million, 2019: €770.0 million)
have been pledged as security against amounts drawn down under the Receivables Securitisation Facility,
described in Note 19, totalling €18.0 million (2020: €114.2 million, 2019: €297.1 million). In accordance with
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ the trade receivable balances pledged as security do not qualify for
derecognition and are included within the trade receivable balances above.

The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables during the year was

The allowance account for trade receivables is used to record any impairment losses unless the
Group is satisfied that no recovery of the amount owing is probable; at that point the amounts considered
irrecoverable are written off against the trade receivables directly.

The credit risk grade is based on the analysis on both the quantitative and qualitative factors as
detailed below:

    - High: Customers under significant financial difficulty and customers for whom there is an
uncertainty of payment based on knowledge of factors like insolvency, dispute. Any receivable
more than 180 days past due should also be classified in this category.

    - Medium: Any receivable between 90 and 180 days past due should be classified as medium risk
unless qualitative factors indicate a higher credit risk.

     - Low: Any receivable less than 90 days past due should be classified as low risk unless qualitative
factors indicate a higher credit risk.

During the year the Group has not experienced a significant deterioration in the quality of
receivable balances due to the current economic conditions.

**_Senior Secured Term Loans_**

The Group has outstanding borrowings under a senior credit facilities agreement dated April 27,
2012 (as amended and restated) which consist of euro and US dollar denominated Term Loans (referred to
as the ‘Senior Secured Term Loans’ or ‘Term Loans’).

In November 2021 the Group raised €1.1 billion of additional Senior Secured Term Loans which
were used to fully redeem the outstanding Senior Notes due 2024. The additional Senior Secured Term
Loans mature on November 8, 2028 and consisted of $845 million of US dollar denominated Term Loans
and €350 million of euro denominated Term Loans. In October 2020 the Group issued new euro denominated
Senior Secured Term Loans of €375 million which mature on October 27, 2027. In addition to these new
Senior Secured Term Loans the Group has euro and US dollar denominated Term Loans maturing on
March 31, 2024.

The Senior Secured Term Loans outstanding at December 31, 2021 before issue costs were
€4,851.1 million (2020: €3,682.3 million, 2019: €3,470.9 million) of which €44.7 million (2020: €37.8 million,
2019: €35.4 million) is due within one year. The total amounts outstanding on the euro denominated Term
Loans were €2,698.9 million and the US dollar denominated Term Loans were €2,152.2 million.

The Term Loans are to be repaid in equal quarterly instalments, in aggregate annual amounts equal
to 1% of the original principal amount of the Term Loans up to the final maturity date, apart from the
euro denominated Term Loans maturing November 2028 which have no repayments until maturity. The
$845 million US dollar denominated Term Loans and €350 million of euro denominated Term Loans issued

**19. INTEREST-BEARING LOANS AND BORROWINGS (continued)**

in November 2021 mature on November 8, 2028, whilst the €375 million euro denominated Senior Secured
Term Loans issued in October 2020 mature on October 27, 2027 with the remaining Term Loans maturing
on March 31, 2024.

The outstanding Term Loans denominated in US dollars bear interest at a rate per annum equal to
USD LIBOR (with the $845 million US dollar denominated Term Loans issued in November 2021 being
subject to a floor of 0.50% per annum) plus the Applicable Margin. All of the Term Loans denominated in
euros bear interest at a rate per annum equal to EURIBOR (subject to a floor of 0.50% per annum) plus
the Applicable Margin.

As at December 31, 2021 the Applicable Margin for the euro denominated Term Loans and the US
dollar denominated Term Loans maturing March 2024 was 2.00%, for the euro denominated Term Loans
maturing October 2027 and November 2028 it was 2.75% and for the US dollar denominated Term Loans
maturing November 2028 it was 2.50%.

The Senior Secured Term Loans rank pari passu with the Senior Secured Notes due May 2026,
Senior Secured Notes due March 2026, Senior Secured Notes due 2025 and the Schuldschein Loan. The
Term Loans are guaranteed by INEOS Group Holdings S.A., INEOS Holdings Limited and certain of their
subsidiaries on a senior secured basis. The Term Loans and the guarantees are secured by first ranking
liens on the same assets (subject to certain exceptions) that secure INEOS Holdings Limited’s obligations
under the senior secured notes.

The Term Loans have numerous customary operating and financial incurrence covenants all of
which have been complied with during the year, including covenants relating to, among other things,
limitations on indebtedness, ability to give guarantees, creation of security interests, making acquisitions
and investments, disposing of assets and paying dividends. The Term Loans have no financial maintenance
covenants.

The Senior Secured Term Loans are stated net of debt issue costs of €21.5 million (2020:
€14.6 million, 2019: €9.0 million). These costs are allocated to the profit and loss account over the term of
the Term Loans.

**_Senior Secured Notes due 2023_**

In April 2019 the Group redeemed in full the Senior Secured Notes due 2023 with the proceeds
from the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes due May 2026 along with cash on hand. Before redemption
the Senior Secured Notes due 2023 were listed on the Euro MTF—Luxembourg Stock Exchange. The Senior
Secured Notes due 2023 bore interest at 4.0% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and
November 1 of each year.

Following the full redemption of the Senior Secured Notes due 2023, unamortised debt issue costs
of €4.0 million and an early prepayment premium of €7.7 million were charged to exceptional finance costs
in April 2019 (see Note 4).

**_Senior Secured Notes due 2025_**

In November 2017 the Group issued €550 million of Senior Secured Notes due 2025. The proceeds
from the new Notes were used to partially repay the Senior Secured Term Loans. The Senior Secured Notes
due 2025 are listed on the Euro MTF—Luxembourg Stock Exchange. The Senior Secured Notes due
2025 bear interest at 2.125% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of
each year. Unless previously redeemed as noted below, the Senior Secured Notes due 2025 will be redeemed
by the Group at their principal amount on November 15, 2025.

The Senior Secured Notes due 2025 can be subject to redemption at any time on or after
November 15, 2020, at the option of the Issuer, in whole or in part, on not less than 10 nor more than
60 days’ prior notice at the following redemption prices (expressed as percentages of the aggregate principal
amount), if redeemed during the 12-month period beginning November 15 of the year indicated below:

**21 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS**

**_Pension plans_**

The Group operates a number of pension plans throughout the world, devised in accordance with
local conditions and practices. The plans are generally of the defined benefit type and are funded by
payments to separately administered funds or insurance companies. The principal funded plans are in the
United Kingdom, North America, Belgium, Switzerland and Germany.

The Group also operates a number of unfunded defined benefit pension schemes in Germany and
France.

The most recent full valuations of the significant defined benefit plans were carried out as follows:

**Plan** **Country** **Valuation date**
All Plans United Kingdom 5 April 2019 and 31 December 2019
All Plans North America 1 January 2021
All Plans Belgium 1 January 2022
All Plans France 31 December 2021
All Plans Germany 31 December 2021
All Plans Switzerland 31 December 2021

These valuations have been updated where appropriate to December 31, 2021 by independent
qualified actuaries.

The Group’s pension schemes have been disclosed on a geographical basis as those schemes in the
United Kingdom, North America and Other European. Other European principally includes the Group’s
pension plans in Germany, Belgium, France and Switzerland.

The UK defined benefit pension plans were historically final salary in nature, with a normal
retirement age of 60. The majority of the UK plans are either closed to new entrants, or frozen to future
accrual. The plans operate under trust law and are managed and administered by Trustees in accordance with
the terms of each plan’s Trust Deed and Rules and relevant legislation. The contributions paid to the UK
plans are set every three years based on a funding agreement between the company and Trustee after taking
actuarial advice.

The North American pension arrangements consist of two funded plans, both closed to new
entrants and future accrual. Both plans were final salary defined benefit in nature, and the plans’ liabilities
are valued regularly in line with US statutory funding requirements. Around 90% of both plans’ assets are
invested in bond instruments, to closely match the profile of each plans’ liabilities.

The Other European pension arrangements are primarily final salary in nature, the majority of
which remain open to new entrants. The majority of plans in Germany are funded through plan assets
from contractual trust arrangements. There are no legal minimum funding requirements, thus the Group
can decide on any plan contributions considering local conditions and practices. The Swiss benefits are
insured, the Belgian plan assets are held in trust, and the remaining schemes are unfunded with associated
provisions held on the Group’s balance sheet.

**_Severance and restructuring costs_**

The severance and restructuring costs provision includes €15.8 million relating to the Köln site
following a reorganisation within the O&P North business in 2015 and is expected to be fully utilised by
2027.

In December 2019 the Group took the decision to close the Nitriles facility at Seal Sands, United
Kingdom. The severance and restructuring costs provision includes €1.0 million in respect of remaining
closure costs including severance and outplacement expenses. The provision is expected to be fully utilised
within the next year.

**_Remediation costs_**

The Group has provided for the cost of remediation works of €15.3 million where there is a legal
or constructive obligation for such work to be carried out. Provisions are established to meet the clean-up
costs of contaminated soil and groundwater, the removal of potentially hazardous substances and rectification
work required to ensure compliance with license to operate obligations. These costs relate mainly to the
Group’s production facilities at the Köln, Chocolate Bayou, Green Lake and Lima sites, a pilot plant at the
Lavera site and oil and gas wells in the Giddings Field. The provision only covers items of specific work

for which a reasonable estimate can be determined. By their nature the amounts and timing of any outflows
in respect of remediation costs are difficult to predict.

In December 2019 the Group took the decision to close the Nitriles facility at Seal Sands, United
Kingdom. The remediation provision includes €1.2 million in respect of decommissioning and demolition
costs. The provision is expected to be fully utilised within the next year.

**_Other provisions_**

**25. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS**

**25a Fair value of financial instruments**

**_Investments in debt and equity securities_**

The fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss is estimated as the present
value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.

Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income are accounted for at fair value
based on the present value of future cash flows where such information is readily available based on the
present value of future cash flows estimated from financial information made available during the year as a
result of a recent transaction in the investment. However, as explained in Note 14, the Group’s financial
assets at fair value through other comprehensive income include certain equity interests which are not quoted
and for which there is no active market. The Group considers that the acquisition cost to be a reasonable
approximation for fair value.

**_Trade and other receivables_**

The carrying amount of trade and other receivables generally approximates to fair value due to
their short maturities. Where settlement is not due in the short term and where the effect is material, fair
value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows discounted at the market rate of interest at the
reporting date.

**25. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)**

**_Trade and other payables_**

The carrying amount of trade and other payables generally approximates to fair value due to their
short maturities. Where settlement is not due in the short term and where the effect is material, fair value is
estimated as the present value of future cash flows discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting
date.

**_Cash and cash equivalents_**

The fair value of cash and cash equivalents is estimated as its carrying amount where the cash is
repayable on demand. Where it is not repayable on demand then the fair value is estimated at the present
value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.

**_Interest-bearing borrowings_**

The fair value of the Senior Secured Term Loans and Senior Secured Notes, which after initial
recognition is determined for disclosure purposes only are based on the market yields derived from quotes
obtained at the year end from leading financial institutions. The fair value of the Receivables and Inventory
Securitisation, Rafnes Facility, Schuldschein Loan, Köln CoGen Facility, Gemini Facility and Other loans
is the same as the carrying value before unamortised debt issue costs.

**_Derivative financial instruments_**

The fair value of interest rate swaps and commodity contracts are based on market or broker
quotes.

**_Fair values_**

The fair values for each class of financial assets and financial liabilities together with their carrying
amounts shown in the consolidated balance sheet are as follows:

The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The
different levels, determined in accordance with IFRS 13 “Fair Value Measurement”, have been defined as
follows:

     - Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

     - Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset
or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and

     - Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable
inputs).

**25. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)**

The commodity derivatives are fair valued using rates in quoted markets. There have been no
transfers between any levels in 2021 (2020 and 2019: no transfers between levels).

**25b Net gains and losses from financial instruments**

Net gains and losses from financial instruments comprise the results of valuations, the amortisation
of discounts, the recognition and derecognition of impairment losses, results from the translation of foreign
currencies, interest, dividends and all effects on profit or loss of financial instruments.

Net gains from financial assets measured at amortised cost relate primarily to recognition and
derecognition of impairment losses, results from the translation of foreign currencies and interest income.

Net losses from financial liabilities measured at amortised cost relate primarily to amortisation of
discounts, results from the translation of foreign currencies, interest expense and other financing related
expenses.

The item ‘financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss’ comprise valuation gains and
losses, and only includes gains and losses from instruments which are not designated as hedging instruments
as defined by IFRS 9.

**25c Credit risk**

**_Financial risk management_**

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial
instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from
customers, deposits with financial institutions and derivatives.

Group Treasury policy and objectives in relation to credit risk is to minimize the likelihood that the
Group will experience financial loss due to counterparty failure and to ensure that in the event of a single
loss, the failure of any single counterparty would not materially impact the financial wellbeing of the Group.

**_Trade and other receivables_**

The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each
customer. However, management also considers the demographics of the Group’s customer base, including


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**25. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)**

the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, as these factors may have an
influence on credit risk. Management considers that there is no geographical concentration of credit risk.
The Group has established a credit policy under which each new customer is analysed individually for
creditworthiness before the Group’s standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered or are
adjusted accordingly. The Group’s review includes external ratings, when available, and in some cases
bank references. Purchase limits are established for each customer, which represent the maximum open
amount without requiring approval. Customers that fail to meet the Group’s benchmark creditworthiness
may transact with the Group only on a prepayment basis.

**_Investments, cash and cash equivalent_**

Surplus cash investments are only made with banks with which the Group has a relationship.

**_Guarantees_**

The Group’s policy is to provide financial guarantees only to wholly-owned subsidiaries. At
December 31, 2021 no guarantees were outstanding (2020: none, 2019: none).

**_Exposure to credit risk_**

The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. Therefore, the
maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was the carrying amount of financial assets. Further
details on the Group’s exposure to credit risk are given in Note 18.

**25d Liquidity risk**

**_Financial risk management_**

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall
due. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have
sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under normal and stressed conditions, without incurring
unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group. The Group’s exposure to liquidity risk is limited by
the fact that it operates with significant cash resources, and it maintains the most appropriate mix of short,
medium and long-term borrowings from the Group’s lenders.

The Group is reliant on committed funding from a variety of sources at Group and subsidiary
company level to meet the anticipated needs of the Group for the period covered by the Group’s budget.

The Group forecasts on a regular basis the expected cash flows that will occur on a weekly and
monthly basis. This information is used in conjunction with the weekly reporting of actual cash balances at
bank in order to calculate the level of funding that will be required in the short and medium term. On a
monthly basis the level of headroom on existing facilities is reported and forecast forward until the end of
the financial period.

In addition, the Group maintains various lines of credits in the form of Senior Secured Notes,
Senior Secured Term Loans, Securitisation, Rafnes Facility, Köln CoGen Facility, Gemini Facility and
Other loans. (See Note 19—“Interest-Bearing Loans and Borrowings” for more information).

**25e Net investment and cash flow hedges**

The Group does not have derivative commodity contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges at
December 31, 2021.

The Group has US$ and Sterling financial liabilities in respect of the Senior Notes and Securitisation
Facility that are designated net investment hedges of US$ and Sterling operations in accordance with the
requirements of IFRS 9. The US$ and Sterling net investment hedges had a carrying value and fair value as
follows:

For the year ended December 31, 2021 gains net of tax of €479.2 million were taken directly to
reserves and reported in the Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year then ended (2020: losses
€527.4 million, 2019: gains €88.0 million). There was no ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement
for the year ended December 31, 2021 (2020: €nil, 2019: €nil). The cumulative net investment hedge reserve
amount as at December 31, 2021 was €442.7 million (2020: €(36.5) million, 2019: €490.9 million).

**25f Market risk**

**_Financial risk management_**

Market risk reflects the possibility that changes in market prices, such as crude oil, feedstock
refined products, chemicals or currency exchange rates or changes in interest rates will adversely affect the
value of the Group’s assets, liabilities or expected future cash flows. The Group holds commodity and interest
rate swap contracts in order to manage market risk. The use of derivative instruments is confined to
specialist teams that have the appropriate skills, experience, supervision, control and reporting systems.

**25. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)**

**_Market risk—Foreign currency risk_**

The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various
currency exposures, primarily with respect to the U.S. Dollar and Sterling.

Foreign exchange risk arises from net investments in foreign operations, future commercial
transactions, and recognised assets and liabilities.

The Group applies hedge accounting to foreign currency differences arising on the retranslation of
a financial liability designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. When the settlement of
a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation is neither planned nor likely in the
foreseeable future, foreign exchange gains and losses arising from such a monetary item is considered to
form part of a net investment in a foreign operation and changes in the fair value are recognised directly
within equity.

A substantial portion of the Group’s revenue is generated in, or linked to, the U.S. dollar and the
euro. In the European petrochemical business, product prices, certain feedstock costs and most other costs
are denominated in euro and sterling. In the U.S. petrochemical and specialty chemicals businesses, product
prices, raw materials costs and most other costs are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars.

The Group generally does not enter into foreign currency exchange instruments to hedge foreign
currency transaction exposure, although the Group has done so in the past and may do so in the future.

The Group benefits from natural hedging, to the extent that currencies in which net cash flows are
generated from the Group’s operations, are matched against long-term indebtedness.

The foreign currency exposure where the Group’s external financial assets/(liabilities) are not
denominated in the functional currency of the operating unit involved is shown below. Foreign exchange
differences on retranslation of these assets and liabilities are taken to the other comprehensive income of the
Group.

**_Sensitivity analysis_**

A change of 1% in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased/(decreased) equity and
profit or loss by the amounts shown below. This calculation assumes that the change occurred at the
reporting date and had been applied to risk exposures existing at that date.

This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant
and considers the effect of financial instruments with variable interest rates, financial instrument at fair
value through profit or loss or available for sale with fixed interest rates and the fixed rate element of interest
rate caps. The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2021, 2020 and 2019.

A 1% change in the opposite direction of the above interest rates at December 31, would have had
the equal but opposite effect on the above currencies to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all
other variables remain constant.

**_Market risk—Commodity price risk_**

This section discusses the Group’s exposure to the commodity contracts which are not covered
under the own use exemption and are recognised as derivative instruments.

The Group and its Refining joint venture are exposed to commodity price risk through fluctuations
in raw material prices and sales of products. The raw material exposures result primarily from the price of
crude oil and base chemicals linked to the price of crude. The sales price exposures are primarily related to
petrochemicals where prices are in general linked to the market price of crude oil.

The Group enters into contracts to supply or acquire physical volumes of commodities at future
dates during the normal course of business that may be considered derivative contracts. Where such


-----

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**25. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)**

contracts exist and are in respect of the normal purchase or sale of products to fulfil the Group’s
requirements, the own use exemption from derivative accounting is applied.

The Group manages commodity price exposures through trading refined products and chemical
feedstock and using commodity swaps, options and futures as a means of managing price and timing risks.
In 2021 there was a net mark to market derivative asset in respect of commodity contracts of €20.0 million
entered into by the Group to manage such risk (2020: net derivative liability of €57.6 million, 2019: net
derivative liability of €44.2 million).

The Group operates within procedures and policies designed to ensure that risks, including those
relating to the default of counterparties, are minimised.

**_Market risk—Equity price risk_**

The Group’s exposure to equity price risk arises from its investment in equity securities which are
classified as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income. These financial assets are
accounted for at fair value based on the present value of future cash flows where such information is readily
available.

For the financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income a 10 percent increase and
decrease in transaction prices at the reporting date would have decreased and increased the loss for the year
by €2.8 million (2020: €2.8 million, 2019: €2.8 million). Management consider that a change of 10 percent
gives an appropriate benchmark to assess the risks that the Group is expected to be exposed to. This calculation
assumes that the change occurred at the reporting date and had been applied to risk exposures existing at
that date. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.

**Capital management**

The Group’s objectives for managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a
going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to
maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

The Group defines its capital employed of €8,986.2 million (2020: €7,701.2 million, 2019:
€7,326.3 million) as shareholders’ equity of €3,353.0 million (2020: €1,461.6 million, 2019: €1,456.4 million)
and net debt (net of debt issue costs) of €5,633.2 million (2020: €6,239.6 million, 2019: €5,869.9 million).

The principal sources of debt available to the Group at December 31, 2021 include the Senior
Secured Term Loans, Senior Secured Notes due March 2026, Senior Secured Notes due May 2026, Senior
Secured Notes due 2025, Receivables Securitisation Facility, Inventory Financing Facility, Schuldschein Loan,
Rafnes Facility, Köln CoGen Facility and the Gemini Facility and are described in Note 19 along with the
key operating and financial covenants that apply to these facilities.

In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends
paid to shareholders, issue new shares, raise new debt or sell assets to reduce debt. The ability of the Group
to pay dividends and provide appropriate facilities to the Group is restricted by the terms of principal
financing agreements to which members of the Group are party.

**29. RELATED PARTIES (continued)**

During 2015 the Group provided a loan of $623.7 million to INEOS Upstream Limited, a related
party, in connection with its acquisition of natural gas assets in the North Sea. The loan facility is unsecured
and matures in June 2024 and bears interest at 7% per annum. On September 29, 2017, INEOS Upstream
Limited, a related party, acquired further natural gas assets in the North Sea through its acquisition of the
entire oil and gas business of DONG Energy A/S. In connection with the DONG Acquisition, the Group
advanced a loan of $376.2 million (€315.7 million) to INEOS Upstream Limited, the proceeds of which were
on lent to certain of its subsidiaries. The loan is unsecured and matures in June 2024 and bears interest at
7% per annum. There were no loan repayments during 2021 (2020: nil, 2019: nil). As at December 31, 2021

was outstanding under the facility.

INEOS Limited owns interests in a number of joint ventures that are not included in the INEOS
Group Holdings S.A. group, including the French joint ventures associated with the Lavera petrochemical
assets and businesses which were divested by the Group on July 1, 2014 and the refining joint ventures between
PetroChina and INEOS Investments (Jersey) Limited, a related party. Previous to becoming a fully owned
subsidiary on December 31, 2020 (see Note 3) the Group had a joint venture with Sasol Limited to build and
operate a HDPE plant at Battleground site in Texas, USA which became operational at the end of 2017.

During the year ended December 31, 2021 the Group made no sales (2020: €0.1 million, 2019:
€0.1 million), recovered net costs of €12.4 million (2020: €0.2 million, 2019: €0.5 million) and made no
purchases (2020: €0.2 million, 2019: €0.2 million) from the French joint ventures. As at December 31, 2021
€0.3 million (2020: €0.1 million, 2019: €0.3 million) was owed by the French joint ventures and €0.1 million
(2020: nil, 2019: €0.2 million) was owed to the French joint ventures.

The Refining joint ventures are between PetroChina and INEOS Investments (Jersey) Limited, a
related party. During the year ended December 31, 2021 the Group made sales to the Refining joint
ventures of €2.5 million (2020: €1.4 million, 2019: nil), recovered costs of €35.1 million (2020: €8.4 million,
2019: €8.6 million) and made purchases of €80.1 million (2020: €145.7 million, 2019: €221.4 million). As
at December 31, 2021, €1.5 million (2020: €1.2 million, 2019: €0.8 million) was owed by the Refining joint
ventures and €1.3 million (2020: €2.0 million, 2019: €25.5 million) was owed to the Refining joint ventures.

Before the HDPE joint venture became a fully owned subsidiary of the Group on December 31,
2020 (see Note 3) the Group recovered costs of €60.5 million (2019: €59.1 million) and made purchases of
€43.6 million (2019: €47.9 million) from the HDPE joint venture. As at December 31, 2019, €5.6 million was
owed by and €5.1 million was owed to the HDPE joint venture.

The Group has entered into a number of derivative contracts with INEOS UK SNS Limited and
INEOS Energy Trading Limited, both related parties. The net fair value loss on these derivatives during the
year ended December 31, 2021 was €109.5 million (2020: €126.2 million, 2019: €80.3 million). As at
December 31, 2021, the mark to market derivative asset was €173.8 million (2020: €17.8 million, 2019:
€15.3 million) and the mark to market liability was €193.2 million (2020: €88.0 million, 2019: €54.5 million)
in respect of these related party derivative financial instruments (see Note 15).

In general, any trading balances with related parties are priced based on contractual arrangements
and are to be settled in cash. The transactions are made on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm’s
length transactions.

None (2020: none, 2019: none) of the related party balances are secured and no guarantees have
been given or received. There were no provisions for doubtful debt related to any related parties as at
December 31, 2021 (2020: nil, 2019: nil).

**_Compensation to key management personnel (including directors)_**

The Group defines key management as the directors of the Company. Details of Directors’
remuneration are given in Note 7.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**30. ULTIMATE PARENT UNDERTAKING AND CONTROLLING PARTY**

The immediate parent undertaking is INEOS Holdings Luxembourg S.A.. The ultimate parent
undertaking at December 31, 2021 was INEOS Limited, a company registered in the Isle of Man. The
ultimate controlling party is Mr JA Ratcliffe, director and majority shareholder of the ultimate parent
undertaking. INEOS Group Holdings S.A. and its subsidiaries are not included within any other consolidated
financial statements.

**31. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS**

The Group prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRSs, which require
management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions which affect the application of the accounting
policies, and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ
from these estimates. The estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to
accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates change and in any future periods.

**Key sources of estimated uncertainty**

Estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that the
Group believe are reasonable, including assets and expected economic conditions, and in certain cases
actuarial assumption. Although these estimates are based on the Group’s knowledge of current events and
circumstances, actual numbers may differ.

**_Post-retirement benefits_**

The Group operates a number of defined benefit post-employment schemes. Under IAS 19
Revised Employee Benefits, management is required to estimate the present value of the future defined
benefit obligation of each of the defined benefit schemes. The costs and year end obligations under defined
benefit schemes are determined using actuarial valuations. The actuarial valuations involve making
numerous assumptions, including:

     - Future rate of increase in salaries;

     - Inflation rate projections;

     - Discount rate for scheme liabilities; and

    - Expected rates of return on the scheme assets.

Details of post-retirement benefits are set out in Note 21.

**32. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS**

The Group does not have operations in Belarus, Russia or Ukraine. During 2021 revenue generated
in these countries was not material to the Group. The Group is not currently experiencing any material
disruption to its operations and does not foresee any direct impact as a result of the conflict, but will continue
to monitor the evolving situation closely. The conflict has led to a significant increase in energy prices;
however the Group is currently successfully managing these increases by passing them onto customers
through higher prices. Therefore the Group is not expecting any material indirect impact on its operations
or performance as a result of the conflict, but is monitoring this closely.

To the Shareholders of
Ineos Group Holdings S.A.

**REPORT OF THE REVISEUR D’ENTREPRISES AGREE**

**Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements**

**Opinion**

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Ineos Group Holdings S.A. and its
subsidiaries (the “Group”), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at December 31, 2020, and
the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated
statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and
notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of
the consolidated financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2020, and its consolidated financial
performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.

**Basis for Opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Law of July 23, 2016 on the audit profession (Law
of July 23, 2016) and with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) as adopted for Luxembourg by the
“Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier” (CSSF). Our responsibilities under the Law of July 23,
2016 and ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF are further described in the “Responsibilities of
the “réviseur d’entreprises agréé” for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements” section of our
report. We are also independent of the Group in accordance with the International Code of Ethics for
Professional Accountants, including International Independence Standards, issued by the International
Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA Code) as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF together
with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements, and
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities under those ethical requirements. We believe that the audit
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

**Other information**

The Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises
the information stated in the consolidated annual report including the management report but does not
include the consolidated financial statements and our report of the “réviseur d’entreprises agréé” thereon.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we
do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read
the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with
the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be
materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report this fact. We have nothing to report in
this regard.

**Responsibilities of the Board of Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements**

The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated
financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, and for such internal
control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for
assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to
going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends
to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

**Responsibilities of the “réviseur d’entreprises agréé” for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue a
report of the “réviseur d’entreprises agréé” that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level


-----

of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Law of July 23, 2016
and with ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF will always detect a material misstatement when it
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the
basis of these consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with the Law of July 23, 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for
Luxembourg by the CSSF, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism
throughout the audit. We also:

     - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and
obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The
risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting
from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations,
or the override of internal control.

     - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.

    - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors.

    - Conclude on the appropriateness of Board of Directors’use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists
related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue
as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw
attention in our report of the “réviseur d’entreprises agréé” to the related disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report of the
“réviseur d’entreprises agréé”. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to
cease to continue as a going concern.

     - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the
underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

     - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities
and business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial
statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit.
We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal
control that we identify during our audit.

**Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements**

The consolidated management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and
has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

**Other matter**

As part of our audit of the 2020 consolidated financial statements, we also audited the adjustments
described in Note 1, paragraph “Restatement of comparatives” that were applied to amend the 2018
consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, such adjustments are appropriate and have been properly
applied. We were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to the 2018 consolidated financial
statements of the Group other than with respect to the adjustments and, accordingly, we do not express an
opinion or any other form of assurance on the 2018 consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020**

_(forming part of the financial statements)_

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

**Overview**

INEOS Group Holdings S.A. (the “Company”) is a company incorporated and domiciled in the
form of a société anonyme under the laws of the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg, having its registered office
at 58, rue Charles Martel, L-2134 Luxembourg, Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg. The nature of the
operations and principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries are the manufacture and sale of a
range of petrochemical products used in a variety of applications.

**Basis of accounting**

The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together
referred to as the “Group”) and equity account the Group’s interest in associates and joint ventures.

In early March 2020, the Group developed contingency plans for the COVID-19 pandemic, with
the primary objectives of maintaining the safety of personnel and the reliable operation of the Group’s
plants. This resulted in a number of changes to standard working practices and shift patterns to reduce
personnel on site to those defined as operationally critical in order to adhere to social distancing rules in line
with local government advice. Any safety critical activity was formally risk assessed to take cognizance of
additional controls necessary to protect core personnel from COVID-19, hence safeguarding safety critical
work at all times.

The chemical industry is deemed as essential, critical infrastructure by governments across the
world. Throughout the pandemic all of the Group’s plants have continued to operate fully and supply
chains have operated without significant disruption. Protecting employees and ensuring that they remain
healthy has been the first priority of the Group. All plants have sufficient resources and have implemented
measures to ensure that this remains the case throughout the pandemic.

Whilst there is uncertainty due to the COVID-19 crisis the Directors have undertaken a rigorous
assessment of the potential impact of COVID-19 on demand for its products and services and the impact
on margins for the next 12 months. In addition, the Directors have implemented a series of programmes to
preserve cash including the review of timing of turnarounds, reductions in the levels of non-essential capital
expenditure and reductions in non-essential fixed cost expenditure. On the basis of this assessment
together with cash balances of €1,342.2 million as at December 31, 2020 and access to the Receivables
Securitisation Facility and the Inventory Financing Facility (see Note 19), the Directors have concluded
that the Group can operate within its current facilities without the need to obtain new ones for a period of
at least 12 months from the date of this report and have therefore prepared these consolidated financial
statements on a going concern basis.

The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union in response
to the IAS regulation (EC 1606/2002) effective as of December 31, 2020 and have been approved for issuance
by the Board of Directors on March 19, 2021.

The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all
periods presented in these Group financial statements.

**Measurement convention**

The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative financial
instruments, financial instruments classified as fair value through the profit or loss or fair value through
other comprehensive income which are stated at their fair value.

**Functional and presentation currency**

These Group financial statements are presented in euro, which is the functional currency of the
majority of operations, with other significant currencies being USD and Sterling. The Group’s primary
products are sold in an international commodities market which is priced and invoiced primarily in euros.

All financial information presented in euro has been rounded to the nearest €0.1 million.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020**

_(forming part of the financial statements)_

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

**Changes in accounting policies**

The Group financial statements have been prepared using consistent accounting policies with the
those of the previous financial year. The Group has adopted the following amendments to accounting
standards for the first time in 2020 with effect from 1 January 2020, although there has been no material
effect on the Group’s financial statements.

    - Amendments to IFRS 3: Definition of a Business has been adopted from 1 January 2020. The
Group has applied this amendment to business combinations whose acquisition dates are on or
after 1 January 2020 in assessing whether it had acquired a business of a group of assets. The
details of accounting policies are set out in Note 1—“Business combinations, goodwill and
intangible assets.”

    - Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7: Interest Rate Benchmark Reform has been
adopted from 1 January 2020. This has been applied retrospectively to hedging relationships that
existed at 1 January 2020 or were designated thereafter and that are directly affected by interest
rate benchmark reform. These amendments also apply to any gain or loss accumulated in the cash
flow hedging reserve that existed at 1 January 2020. The details of the accounting policies are
disclosed in Note 1—“Derivative financial instruments and hedging.”

    - Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards: The Conceptual
Framework for Financial Reporting is the foundation on which the IASB develops new accounting
standards. The revised Framework is more comprehensive than the old one—its aim is to
provide the Board with the full set of tools for standard setting. It covers all aspects of standard
setting from the objective of financial reporting, to presentation and disclosures.

    - Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8: Definition of Material: The IASB refined its definition of
material to make it easier to understand. “Information is material if omitting, misstating or
obscuring it could reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general
purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements, which provide
financial information about a specific reporting entity.”

**Basis of consolidation**

_Subsidiaries_

Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The
Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement
with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.

Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.

The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations, except acquisitions
under common control which are outside the scope of IFRS 3. The consideration transferred for the
acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former
owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes
the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable
assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured
initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the
acquiree on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s
proportionate share of the recognised amounts of acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related
costs are expensed as incurred.

If the business combination of a subsidiary or joint venture is achieved in stages, the acquisition
date carrying value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re-measured to fair
value at the acquisition date; any gains or losses arising from such re-measurement are recognised in profit
or loss.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020**

_(forming part of the financial statements)_

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the Group is recognised at fair value at the
acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be
an asset or liability is recognised in accordance with IFRS 9 in the profit or loss. Contingent consideration
that is classified as equity is not re-measured, and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.

Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group
companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated.

Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for
as equity transactions—that is, as transactions with the owners in their capacity as owners. The difference
between fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net
assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are
also recorded in equity.

When the Group ceases to have control any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair
value at the date when control is lost, with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. The
fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest
as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other
comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of
the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive
income are reclassified to profit or loss.

_Special purpose entities (“SPE”)_

An SPE is consolidated if, based on an evaluation of the substance of its relationship with the
Group and the SPE’s risks and rewards, the Group concludes that it controls the SPE. The Group has
established an SPE, INEOS Finance Ireland Limited, for a debt securitisation programme. The Group does
not have any direct or indirect shareholdings in this SPE. INEOS Finance Ireland Limited is controlled by
the Group as it was established under terms that impose strict limitations on the decision-making powers of
the SPE’s management that result in the Group receiving the majority of the benefits related to the SPE’s
operations and net assets, being exposed to the majority of risks arising from the SPE’s activities, and
retaining the majority of the residual or ownership risks related to the SPE and its assets. INEOS Finance
Ireland Limited is therefore regarded as an SPE and has been consolidated in these financial statements.

_Associates_

Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally
accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are
accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, the investment is initially
recognised at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the investor’s share of
the profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition. The Group’s investment in associates includes
goodwill identified on acquisition. If the ownership interest in an associate is reduced but significant
influence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive
income is reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate.

The Group’s share of post-acquisition profit or loss is recognised in the income statement, and its
share of post-acquisition movements in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive
income with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the investment. When the Group’s share
of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured
receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive
obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.

The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the
investment in the associate is impaired. If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment
as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value and recognises the
amount adjacent to ‘share of profit/(loss) of associates’ in the income statement.

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

Profits and losses resulting from upstream and downstream transactions between the Group and
its associate are recognised in the Group’s financial statements only to the extent of unrelated investor’s
interests in the associates. Unrealised losses are eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an
impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of associates have been changed where necessary
to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

_Joint arrangements_

The Group applies IFRS 11 to all joint arrangements. Under IFRS 11 investments in joint
arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures depending on the contractual rights
and obligations of each investor. The Group has assessed the nature of its joint arrangements and determined
them to be joint ventures. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.

Under the equity method of accounting, interests in joint ventures are initially recognised at cost
and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses and
movements in other comprehensive income. When the Group’s share of losses in a joint venture equals or
exceeds its interests in the joint ventures (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part
of the Group’s net investment in the joint ventures), the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it
has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint ventures.

Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the
extent of the Group’s interest in the joint ventures. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction
provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of the joint ventures
have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

**Foreign exchange**

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group
entities at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency at the
foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised
in the consolidated income statement except for differences arising on the retranslation of a financial
liability designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation, or qualifying cash flow hedges,
which are recognised in other comprehensive income. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured
in terms of historical cost in a foreign exchange are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the
transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value
are retranslated to the functional currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was
determined.

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments
arising on consolidation, are translated to the Group’s presentational currency, euros, at foreign exchange
rates ruling at the reporting date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at exchange
rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. The Group applies an average rate for the year where this
rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Exchange differences
arising from this translation of foreign operations are taken directly to the translation reserve. They are
recycled into the consolidated income statement upon disposal.

Exchange differences arising from a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign
operation, the settlement of which is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, are considered to
form part of a net investment in a foreign operation and are recognised directly in equity in the translation
reserve. Foreign exchange differences arising on the retranslation of a borrowing designated as a hedge of
a net investment in a foreign operation are recognised directly in OCI, in the translation reserve, to the extent
that the hedge is effective. When the hedged part of a net investment is disposed of, the associated cumulative
amount in equity is transferred to profit or loss as an adjustment to the profit or loss on disposal.

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020**

_(forming part of the financial statements)_

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

**Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group**

Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet
the following two conditions:

(a) They include no contractual obligation upon the Group to deliver cash or other financial
assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under
conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Group; and

(b) Where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity instruments, it is
either a non-derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the
Company’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company’s
exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its
own equity instruments.

To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial
liability. Where the instrument so classified takes the legal form of the Company’s own shares, the amounts
presented in these financial statements for called up share capital and share premium account exclude
amounts in relation to those shares.

**Non-derivative financial instruments**

Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities, trade and
other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.

_Trade and other receivables_

Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value plus transaction costs that are
directly attributable to the acquisition or issue. Subsequent to initial recognition they are tested for
classification as per IFRS 9. If the trade receivables satisfy the criteria for cash flow characteristics test and
business model test as per IFRS 9, then they are recognised at amortised cost. If they do not qualify for
being recognised at amortised cost they are recognised at fair value through profit or loss or at fair value
through other comprehensive income.

_Trade and other payables_

Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value less transaction costs that are directly
attributable to the acquisition or issue. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at amortised
cost using the effective interest method.

_Investments in debt and equity securities_

Investments in debt securities are measured at amortised cost if they meet both of the following
conditions and are not designated as a fair value through profit and loss:

     - The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual
cash flows; and

     - The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

A financial asset is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income only if it meets
both of the following conditions and is not designated as a fair value through profit and loss:

     - The asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting
contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and

     - The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020**

_(forming part of the financial statements)_

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

For investment in equity securities that are not held for trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to
present subsequent changes to fair value in other comprehensive income. The Group makes this election on
an investment-by-investment basis.

All other financial assets, including derivatives, are classified as measured at fair value through
profit and loss. When these investments are derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised
directly in equity is recognised in the income statement. Where these investments are interest-bearing,
interest calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in the income statement. Where no reliable
measurement of fair value is available, investments are stated at historic acquisition cost.

_Cash and cash equivalents_

Cash and cash equivalents comprise of cash balances and call deposits.

_Interest-bearing borrowings_

Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the
effective interest method.

_Debt restructuring_

The Group derecognises financial liabilities in accordance with the provisions in IFRS 9. When
debt is modified, the Group analyses the modifications from both a quantitative and qualitative perspective
to determine if the modifications are substantial and meet the IFRS requirements for de-recognition, in
which case the debt is treated as extinguished. All fees paid in connection with a debt extinguishment are
expensed immediately. When a modification is accounted for as a non-substantial modification, associated
fees incurred are deferred as an adjustment to the carrying value of the liability and amortised using the
original effective interest rate.

**Derivative financial instruments and hedging**

_Derivative financial instruments_

Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value. The gain or loss on subsequent
re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement as finance
income or expense. Where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss
depends on the nature of the item being hedged.

**Hedge of net investment of foreign operation**

The Group applied hedge accounting to foreign exchange differences arising on the retranslation
of a foreign currency loan where the loan is designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation
in accordance with IFRS 9.

Most commonly this means that exchange differences arising on retranslation of foreign currency
loans designated as a net investment hedge are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive
income. Gains and losses accumulated in the translation reserve will be recycled to the statement of
comprehensive income when the foreign operation is sold.

When a derivative instrument or a non-derivative financial liability is designated as the hedging
instrument in a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, the effective portion of, for a derivative
changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument or, for a non-derivative, foreign exchange gains and losses
is recognised in OCI and presented in the translation reserve within equity. Any ineffective portion of the
changes in the fair value of the derivative or foreign exchange gains and losses on the non-derivative is
recognised immediately in the income statement. The amount recognised in OCI is reclassified to the income
statement as a reclassification adjustment on disposal of the foreign operation.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020**

_(forming part of the financial statements)_

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

**Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated
impairment losses.

Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. Cost may
include the cost of materials, labour and other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to a working
condition for their intended use. Cost may also include the cost of dismantling and removing items and
restoring the site on which they are located.

Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are
accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.

Depreciation is charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment. Depreciation commences
from the date an asset is brought into service. Land and assets in the course of construction are not
depreciated. The estimated useful lives are as follows:

     - Buildings 10 - 40 years

     - Plant and equipment and fixtures and fittings 3 - 40 years

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date.

The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Where an indicator of
impairment exists, the Group makes an estimate of the recoverable amount, which is the higher of the asset’s
fair value less cost to sell and value in use. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable
amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.

Assets are derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise
from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of the asset (calculated as
the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying value of the asset) is included in the
consolidated income statement in the period in which the item is derecognised.

**Business combinations, goodwill and intangible assets**

All business combinations are accounted for by applying the Acquisition method, except
acquisitions under common control which are outside the scope of IFRS 3. Goodwill represents amounts
arising on acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.

Acquisitions under common control are accounted for at book value. The difference in the book
value of the assets acquired and consideration paid is recognised in a distributable merger reserve.

Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to groups of
cash-generating units and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment. The cash generating units
within the Group are predominately business units. In respect of equity accounted investees, the carrying
amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment in the investee.

Negative goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised immediately in the consolidated income
statement.

_Intangible assets_

Intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation
and accumulated impairment losses. These intangible assets principally comprise intellectual property
rights, customer relationships, non-compete agreements and license fees.

Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are carried initially at cost. The initial cost is
the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of other consideration given to acquire the assets. An intangible


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020**

_(forming part of the financial statements)_

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

asset acquired as part of a business combination is recognised separately from goodwill if the asset is
separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably.

_Amortisation_

Amortisation is charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite. Intangible assets with an indefinite
useful life and goodwill are systematically tested for impairment at each reporting date. Other intangible
assets are amortised from the date they are available for use. The estimated useful lives are as follows:

    - Customer relationships 3 - 12 years

     - Intellectual property rights 10 - 15 years

    - Non-compete agreements life of the agreement

    - Licenses up to 15 years

These intangible assets are tested for impairment at the end of the reporting period if events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Useful lives are examined
on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis.

_Research and development_

Expenditure on research activities is recognised in the consolidated income statement as an expense
as incurred.

Expenditure on development activities is capitalised if the product or process is technically and
commercially feasible and the Group intends to and has the technical ability and sufficient resources to
complete development, future economic benefits are probable and if the Group can measure reliably the
expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development. Development activities involve a plan
or design for the production of new or substantially improved products or processes. The expenditure
capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads. Where
regulatory and other uncertainties are such that the criteria are not met, the expenditure is recognised in
the income statement. Other development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense
as incurred. Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and less
accumulated impairment losses.

**Impairment of financial assets**

_Trade and other receivables_

The Group applies the simplified approach when providing for expected credit losses prescribed by
IFRS 9 for its trade receivables and contract assets. This approach requires the Group to recognise the
lifetime expected loss provision for all trade receivables taking in consideration historical as well as forwardlooking information.

Where the Group has assessed the probability of default of a financial asset to be low, the loss
allowance is considered immaterial.

The Group assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses associated with the
financial assets classified at amortised cost at each balance sheet date and adjusts the allowance accordingly.

_Investments in debt and equity securities_

Impairment of equity securities classified as FVOCI are not tested for impairment under IFRS 9.
If the fair value of a debt instrument classified as FVOCI increases and the increase can be objectively
related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in the income statement, the
impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020**

_(forming part of the financial statements)_

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

**Impairment of non-financial assets excluding inventories and deferred tax assets**

The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax
assets are assessed at the end of the reporting period to determine whether there is any indication of
impairment.

For goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life and intangible assets
that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated at the end of the reporting period.

An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating
unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement.

Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the
carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to cash-generating units and then to reduce the carrying amount
of the other assets in the unit on a pro rata basis. A cash generating unit is the smallest identifiable group
of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or
groups of assets.

_Calculation of recoverable amount_

The recoverable amount is the greater of fair value less cost to sell and value in use. In assessing
value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.

For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is
determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

_Reversals of impairment_

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.

In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed when there is an indication that the
impairment loss may no longer exist and there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the
recoverable amount.

An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed
the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment
loss had been recognised.

**Inventories**

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, using the first-in first-out or average cost method, and
net realisable value which is defined as the estimated selling price less the estimated cost of completion and
the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Cost includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories,
production or conversion costs and other costs in bringing them to their existing location and condition.
In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads
based on normal operating capacity. Provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving or defective items where
appropriate.

Items owned by the Group that are held on consignment at another entity’s premises are included
as part of the Group’s inventory.

**Commodities**

Contracts that are entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of receipt or delivery of
non-financial items in accordance with the Group’s expected purchase, sale or usage requirements (own-use
contracts) are not accounted for as derivative financial instruments, but rather as executory contracts.


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020**

_(forming part of the financial statements)_

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

**IFRS 16 Leases**

At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A
contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for
a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the
use of an identified asset, the Group uses the definition of a lease in IFRS 16.

**_Group as a lessee_**

_Right-of-use assets_

The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the
underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated
depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of
right- of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognized and lease payments made at or before
the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and
remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease
incentives received.

The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the
commencement date to the end of the lease term, unless the lease transfers ownership of the underlying
asset to the Group by the end of the lease term or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group
will exercise a purchase option. In that case the right-of-use asset will be depreciated over the useful life of the
underlying asset, which is determined on the same basis as those of property and equipment. In addition,
the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain
remeasurements of the lease liability.

_Lease liabilities_

At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the
present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term, discounted using the interest rate implicit
in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate.

The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), variable lease
payments that depend on an index or a rate (initially measured using the index or rate as at the
commencement date), amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees less any lease incentives
receivable. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be
exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating a lease, if the lease term reflects the Group
exercising the option to terminate. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate
are expensed in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.

The lease liability is subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on
the lease liability (using the effective interest method) and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the
lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a
modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments a change in the
assessment of whether the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an option to purchase the underlying asset,
a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, or if there is a change in the
Group’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee.

When the lease liability is remeasured in this way and there has been no change in the scope of the
lease, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded
in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.

_Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets_

The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to all leases that have a lease term
of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option. The Group also


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020**

_(forming part of the financial statements)_

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases of assets that are valued below
€10,000. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised as expense on a
straight-line basis over the lease term.

**_Lease policies applicable prior to 1 January 2019_**

_Operating lease payments_

Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the consolidated income statement on a
straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised in the consolidated
income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.

_Finance lease payments_

Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the
outstanding liability. The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a
constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.

**Employee benefits**

The Group operates a number of defined contribution plans and funded and unfunded defined
benefit pension schemes. The Group also provides unfunded early retirement benefits, long service awards
and an incentive plan for certain employees.

The Group provides health care insurance to eligible retired employees and their dependants,
primarily in the United States.

_Defined contribution plans_

A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Group pays fixed
contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the
consolidated income statement as incurred.

_Defined benefit plans_

A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan.
The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefits
is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have
earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its
present value, and the fair value of any plan assets (at bid price) are deducted. The liability discount rate is
the yield at the reporting date on AA credit rated bonds denominated in the currency of, and that have
maturity dates approximating to the terms of, the Group’s obligations. The calculation is performed by a
qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.

When the benefits of a plan are amended or curtailed, the portion of the increased or decreased
benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised as an expense immediately in the consolidated
income statement.

Where the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the asset recognised is limited to the
present value of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.

The pension scheme surplus (to the extent that it is recoverable) or deficit is recognised in full.

The movement in the scheme surplus/deficit is split between:

     - cost of sales and administrative expenses,

     - net finance costs and,


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020**

_(forming part of the financial statements)_

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

    - in net expense recognised directly in equity, the remeasurements of post employment benefit
obligations.

_Short-term benefits_

Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed
as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term
cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this
amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

**Provisions**

A provision is recognised in the consolidated balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or
constructive obligation as a result of a past event, that can be reliably measured and it is probable that an
outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by
discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects risks specific to the liability.

**Share capital**

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new
shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.

**Revenue**

Revenue represents the invoiced value of products and services sold or services provided to third
parties net of sales discounts, value added taxes and duties. Contracts for goods and services are analysed
to determine the distinct performance obligations against which revenue should be recognised. The amount
to be recognised is determined from the standalone selling prices for goods and services, allocated to the
performance obligations. Revenue is recognised when (or as) the performance obligations are satisfied by
transferring a promised good or service to a customer.

The pricing for products sold is determined by market prices (market contracts and arrangements)
or is linked by a formula to published raw material prices plus an agreed additional amount (formula
contracts). Revenue arising from the sale of goods is recognised when the goods are dispatched or delivered
depending on the relevant delivery terms and point at which the control of the good or service is transferred
to the customer.

Services provided to third parties include administrative and operational services provided to other
chemical companies with facilities on our sites and services under tolling arrangements. Under tolling
arrangements, customers pay for or provide raw materials to be converted into certain specified products,
for which the Group charges a toll fee. The Group only recognises toll fee as revenue earned under such
arrangements upon shipment of the converted product to the customer as this is the point at which the
control of the service is transferred to the buyer. For all other services, revenue is recognised at a point in
time. There are no arrangements of significance which transfer goods or services over time.

**Government grants**

Government grants are shown in the consolidated balance sheet as deferred income. This income is
amortised on a straight line basis over the same period as the tangible fixed asset to which it relates or the
life of the related project.

**Finance income and expenses**

Interest income and interest expense are recognised in the consolidated income statement as it
accrues, using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised in the consolidated income
statement on the date the entity’s right to receive payments is established. Foreign exchange gains and losses
are reported on a gross basis.


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020**

_(forming part of the financial statements)_

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

Finance costs comprise interest payable, finance charges on leases, unwinding of the discount on
provisions, net fair value losses on derivatives, net interest on employee benefit liabilities and foreign
exchange losses that are recognised in the consolidated income statement (see foreign exchange accounting
policy).

Finance income comprises interest receivable on funds invested and from related party loans, net
fair value gains on derivatives and foreign exchange gains.

**Taxation**

Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the
consolidated income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in
which case it is recognised in equity.

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted
or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of
previous years.

Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following
temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of
assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination;
and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the
foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or
settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at
the end of the reporting period. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if it is possible that there is a
legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets because they relate to taxes levied by the
same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax
liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.

A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will
be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.

**Segmental analysis**

The Group determines its operating segments in a manner consistent with the internal reporting
provided to the chief operating decision-makers. The chief operating decision-makers are responsible for
allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments. The chief operating decisionmakers are the members of the Executive Committee of the ultimate parent undertaking, INEOS Limited.

An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which
it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with
any of the Group’s other components and for which discrete financial information is available. An operating
segment’s operating results are reviewed regularly by the chief operating decision-makers to make decisions
about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance.

The Group’s primary format for segment reporting is based on business segments. The business
segments are determined based on the Group’s management and internal reporting structure and the
aggregation criteria set out in IFRS 8.

Segment results that are reported to the chief operating decision-makers include items directly
attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.

Segment capital expenditure is the total payments made during the period to acquire property,
plant and equipment and intangible assets other than as acquired through business combinations.

**Emission trading scheme**

The Group participates in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. The Scheme encourages companies
to reduce carbon emissions by offering financial incentives if they achieve their annual reduction targets. If
a company reduces emissions beyond their target then the surplus may be traded in the form of emissions
permits.


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020**

_(forming part of the financial statements)_

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

The incentive money due from the EU Emissions Trading Scheme is recognised in the consolidated
income statement once the reduction targets have been met. The emissions permits allocated under the
Scheme are at nil cost. The Group recognises the revenue from such permits upon their sale to third parties.

The Group recognises a provision for emissions produced. The provision is measured at the
carrying amount of the emission rights held (nil if granted, otherwise at cost) or, in the case of a shortfall,
at the current fair value of the emission rights needed.

**Exceptional items**

In order to provide readers with a clear and consistent presentation of the underlying operating
performance of the Group’s ongoing business it separately identifies those profits and losses which because
of their size or nature, are outside the normal course of business so are expected to be non-recurring.
This may include the disposal of businesses, the impairment of non-current assets, the cost of restructuring
acquired or existing businesses, the impact of one off events such as legal settlements or finance costs
relating to call premia and write-off of unamortised debt issue costs following substantial modification or
redemption of debt as exceptional items.

**Accounting standards not applied**

A number of new standards and amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after
1 January 2020 and earlier application is permitted; however, the Group has not early adopted the new or
amended standards in preparing these consolidated financial statements.

The impact of their adoption is being assessed and is not expected to have a material impact on the
Group’s financial statements in the period of initial application unless otherwise indicated:

    - Amendment to IFRS 16- COVID-19- Related Rent Concessions (effective date 1 June 2020).

    - Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7 and IFRS 16: Interest Rate Benchmark Reform—
Phase 2 (effective date 1 January 2021).

    - Amendments to IAS 37: Onerous Contracts—Cost of Fulfilling a Contract (effective date
1 January 2022).

    - Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS 3 (effective date 1 January
2022).

    - Amendments to IAS 16: Property, Plant and Equipment—Proceeds before Intended Use
(effective date 1 January 2022).

    - Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020 (effective date 1 January 2022).

    - IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (effective date 1 January 2023).

    - Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Classification of Liabilities as
Current or Non-current (effective date 1 January 2023).

**Restatement of comparatives**

The Group has revised its calculation of deferred tax assets in relation to unfunded defined benefit
pension plan liabilities in Germany to comply with the requirements of IAS 12. The revised calculations
have resulted in a restatement of prior year comparatives for deferred tax assets and other reserves included
in equity. The restatement has led to a decrease in deferred tax assets and an increase in other reserves
deficit of €71.6m as at January 1, 2018. The effect of this restatement is summarised in the table below:

**2. OPERATING SEGMENTS**

The determination of the Group’s operating segments is based on the business units for which
information is reported to the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker. The Group has three reportable
segments, as described below.

The Group’s Olefins and Polymers business units produce olefins and related products and a broad
range of polymers. The Group’s olefins businesses are focused on ethylene and propylene, which are the
two largest volume olefins globally and are key building blocks for polymers. These olefins are primarily used
as feedstock for the Group’s polymers business. In addition, the Group sells olefins to third party customers
for a variety of industrial and consumer applications, including plastics, rubber and fibre.

    - O&P North America segment—In North America, the group’s Olefins and Polymers business
comprises five sites including major facilities in Chocolate Bayou, Texas, and Battleground, Texas.

    - O&P Europe segment—In Europe, the Group owns and operates two major cracker complexes,
in Köln, Germany and Rafnes, Norway. This includes polymers and derivatives units.

    - Chemical Intermediates—This reportable segment is the aggregation, in compliance with IFRS
8, of a number of different business units with similar economic and other characteristics. Chemical
Intermediates are high-value added chemical products used as key components in a variety of
consumer and industrial products. The Group’s chemical intermediates businesses are exposed to
similar key commodities, namely oil and gas. They produce a range of products including
phenol, alpha olefins, solvents, industrial chemicals and nitriles. The Chemical Intermediates
processes are similar in that they are all capital intensive and based upon processing and mixing
chemical raw materials to produce chemical products for the next stage along the value chain. The
Chemical Intermediates products are distributed on a business-to-business basis across the
world. This is performed using similar conventional methods of pipeline, truck, rail or ship
container depending on the customer location and size of the order. The Chemical Intermediates
customer base is similar in that the customers are generally manufacturers of consumer and
industrial products in developed markets and mature industrial economies.

The accounting policies of all of the reportable segments are as described in Note 1.

Information regarding the operations of each reportable segment is included in the following
tables. Performance is measured based on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and
exceptional items, measured under IFRS (“Segment EBITDA”). A reconciliation to IFRS profit before tax is
presented in the following tables. Segment EBITDA is used to measure performance as management
believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to
other entities that operate within these industries. Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arm’s length
basis. Information regarding segments reviewed by management includes management accounts comprising
the profit or loss, cash flows and other financial and non-financial information used to manage the
business.

In presenting information on the basis of geographic analysis of segments, segment revenue is
based on the geographical location of customers and geographical locations from which the Group derives
revenues.

Revenues from external customers for each product and service or each group of similar products
and services and a geographic analysis of segment assets are not presented as the necessary information is
not available and the Directors are of the opinion that the cost to develop it would be excessive.

All businesses within the group typically sell individual cargos based on agreed price with delivery
from the plant or at the customer premise. As such, the revenue is recognised as title passes, at a point in
time, and there are no arrangements of significance which transfer goods or services over time. No significant
contract balances arise. No costs to obtain or fulfil contracts are incurred, and therefore no related assets
arise.

**3. ACQUISITIONS**

**_Acquisition of subsidiaries in the current year_**

**Gemini**

On December 31, 2020, the Group acquired 50% of the ordinary shares in Gemini HDPE LLC
(“Gemini”) from Sasol Chemicals North America LLC for cash consideration of $223.8 million
(€187.3 million). The principal activity of the company is to produce high density polyethylene in La Porte,
Texas, USA under tolling arrangements with its owners who provide the feedstock and pay a fee for this
service. The acquisition increased the Group’s interest in Gemini to 100%. Prior to the acquisition the Group
reflected its 50% interest in Gemini as a joint venture (see Note 12a).

As Gemini HDPE LLC is a toll manufacturer on behalf of its owners the overall direct impact on
the Group revenue and profit and loss had the acquisition occurred at the start of the year is immaterial.

**Difference between consideration and provisional net assets acquired . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **138.8**

The fair values disclosed are provisional due to the proximity of the acquisition to the preparation
of these financial statements so further work may be required to confirm final fair values. The finalisation
of the work to determine the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired will be completed within
12 months of the acquisition date.

The difference between consideration and provisional net assets acquired has been recognised as
goodwill within intangible assets (see Note 11) and has arisen because of the expected synergies and the
ability of the Group to market the full output of Gemini. The goodwill has been allocated to the O&P North
America reporting segment and is deductible for tax purposes over a period of 15 years.

_Settlement of pre-existing contractual relationship_

INEOS and Gemini are parties to four pre-existing agreements namely, a tolling agreement, a
ground lease, a licensing agreement and an operating contract. At the acquisition date these pre-existing
relationships were effectively settled as part of the acquisition.

The fair value of the agreements at the acquisition date was nil, and consequently there is no
adjustment to the consideration paid or income or cost associated with the settlement of the relationship
reflected in the Group financial statements.

_Acquisition related costs_

The Group did not incur any acquisition related costs in connection with the transaction.

Prior to the acquisition date, the Group’s interest in the Gemini joint venture was accounted for in
accordance with the equity method of accounting. As a result of the acquisition the previously held interest
of 50% has been disposed of for a fair value of €187.3 million ($223.8 million), being the equivalent of the
value paid to Sasol for their 50% shareholding. Therefore, the gain on the previously held equity interest in
Gemini has been calculated as follows:

On November 1, 2016 the Group acquired 100% of the shares of WLP Holding Corporation, one
of the largest high density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe manufacturers in North America for an initial
consideration of €162.1 million. The business is headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas with production
facilities in Kentucky, South Dakota, Utah, Texas, and Wyoming. WL Plastics has over 500 million pounds
of annual production capacity and provides HDPE pipe for use in oil, gas, industrial, mining, conduit,
and municipal water and sewer applications. This acquisition forms part of the O&P North America segment.

During the year ended December 31, 2020 the Group paid a further €15.6 million (2019:
€15.0 million, 2018: €7.4 million) which was the final instalment of the contingent consideration which was
subject to the acquired business achieving certain targets over a three year period.

**_Acquisition of subsidiaries in prior years_**

**INESCO combined heat and power plant**

On March 1, 2019, the Group acquired 100% of the shares of RWE Generation Belgium NV, the
owner of a Cogeneration unit on the Oxide Antwerp site in Belgium for cash consideration of €70.4 million.
The business consists of two 50MW units and an additional 35MW steam generator. All the steam and
approximately one third of the electricity is consumed by the Group and a number of co-siting companies
on the site in Antwerp. The remainder of the electricity is sold to the Belgian electricity grid, through a short
term marketing contract with the previous owner RWE. This acquisition forms part of the Chemical
Intermediates segment and is defined as a business under IFRS 3.

For the ten month period since March 1, 2019, the acquired business contributed revenue of
€123.5 million and an EBITDA of €14.3 million. If the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2019,
management estimates that the business would have contributed revenues of €148.5 million and EBITDA
of €17.1 million.

An exceptional administrative charge of €8.9 million has been charged during 2020, which related
to a provision for early retirement costs as part of a restructuring of the Köln site within the O&P Europe
business.

In December 2019 the Group took the decision to close the Nitriles facility at Seal Sands, United
Kingdom. Poor operating performance and uneconomic capital expenditure requirements to meet safety
and environmental obligations led to the decision. As a result, an exceptional administrative charge of
€35.1 million was incurred in 2019 for closure costs including severance and outplacement expenses, together
with decommissioning and demolition costs. In addition, tangible fixed assets at the facility of €33.3 million
were impaired during the year ended December 31, 2019 along with a further €26.2 million impairment
charge in the year ended December 31, 2020 (see Note 10).

An exceptional administrative charge of €13.0 million was also incurred during 2019 relating to the
settlement of an intellectual property dispute in respect of the former Technologies business.

**_Exceptional finance costs_**

In April 2019 following the early redemption of the Senior Secured Notes due 2023, an exceptional
finance cost of €11.7 million was recognised which included an early prepayment premium of €7.7 million
and the write-off of deferred issue costs associated with the redeemed Notes of €4.0 million.

Included in 2020 is an exceptional impairment charge of €118.5 million of plant and equipment
following the Group’s decision to terminate work on a propane dehydrogenation unit and associated
infrastructure at its site in Antwerp, Belgium (see Note 4).

During the year a further impairment charge of €26.2 million (2019: €33.3 million) was made in
respect of tangible fixed assets at the Nitriles facility at Seal Sands, United Kingdom following a decision to
close the site in December 2019 due to poor operating performance and uneconomic capital expenditure

infrastructure, machinery and IT equipment which are classified as right-of-use assets. Prior to 1 January

**11. INTANGIBLE ASSETS (continued)**

**_Impairment_**

Goodwill has been allocated to cash generating units (CGU) or groups of cash generating units as
follows:

**2020** **2019** **2018**
**€m**
O&P Europe . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 246.2 246.2 246.2

Chemical Intermediates . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 80.5 80.5 80.5
**Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **790.1** **681.9** **675.9**

The recoverable amount is based on the value in use of each CGU based on the latest board
approved five year plan. The forecasts are based on current performance and management’s assumptions
regarding the future development of individual parameters including raw material prices and profit margins,
utilising available market pricing forecasts. Future assumptions regarding market demand are based on
external macroeconomic sources and specific data relevant to the petrochemical industry and management’s
knowledge of the local markets in which it operates.

The cash flows after the plan period are based on an average of each of the years in the five year
plan to take account of the cyclical nature of the industry extrapolated using long term growth rates as set
out in the table below.

No impairment charge has been recorded in these financial statements as a result of the annual
impairment test.

The key assumptions underlying the value in use calculation for all CGUs are shown below:

**2020** **2019** **2018**
Period on which management approved forecasts are based . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 years 5 years 5 years
Discount rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8.5% 8.5% 8.5%
Growth rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3.0% 3.0% 3.0%

A terminal value is calculated based on the average cash flows over the five year forecasting period
assuming compound growth of 3% and is discounted over the expected lives of the assets of 40 years.

When determining the discount rate the pre-tax weighted average cost of capital of the Group is
considered at each respective period end.

The growth rate used includes inflationary growth across our various markets.

The estimated recoverable amount exceeded the carrying amount for all cash generating units.

Sensitivity analysis on the recoverable amount was performed based on a 1% change in the discount
rate and a 1% change in the growth rate, both of which are considered a reasonable possible change in
estimate. Neither of these changes resulted in the recoverable amount being lower than the carrying amount.

**_Joint ventures_**

On July 1, 2011 the group restructured the Refining business into a new joint venture between
PetroChina and INEOS Investments (Jersey) Limited (‘II(J)L’), a related party. II(J)L is held under
common control by our controlling shareholders. The consideration received by the Group for the disposal
consisted of cash consideration of $1.015 billion received from PetroChina for a 50% interest in the
business and an investment in non-voting ordinary shares in II(J)L for the other 50% interest in the business.

The Group retains an economic interest in the Refining business by virtue of its investment in
II(J)L. The results of the Refining business are reported within the share of profit/(loss) of associates and
joint ventures using the equity accounting method by virtue of the Group’s effective control of II(J)L. The
Group has no ongoing obligations to fund the Refining business.

In July 2014 the Group set up a new joint venture entity (Gemini HDPE LLC) with Sasol to build
and operate an HDPE plant at the Battleground site in Texas, USA. The Gemini plant became fully
operational in the fourth quarter of 2017. During 2018 €12.9 million was invested into the joint venture. On
December 31, 2020 the Group acquired the remaining 50% interest in the joint venture to become the
100% owner of the plant which has resulted in the disposal of the Group’s previous 50% equity accounted
interest of €109.0 million and a gain on disposal of €78.3 million (see Note 3).

In October 2020 the group invested €1.6 million into a joint venture set up with a Chinese partner
to jointly develop Acrylonitrile technology for use within the Chinese market, and to protect against misuse of technology where appropriate.

Before being disposed the Group held a non-voting preferred partnership interest in INEOS
Investments Partnership, an entity held under common control by the Group’s ultimate shareholders, which
owned 24% of the share capital of the PQ Corporation, a silicas business incorporated in the USA and
listed on the New York stock exchange. The Group previously held this investment at amortised cost under
IAS 39; however in 2018 as a result of IFRS 9 it was designated as a financial asset at fair value through
profit or loss. The remeasurement of this investment under IFRS 9 resulted in an adjustment to opening
equity of €6.1 million as at January 1, 2018.

In 2019 the Group disposed of its preferential interest in INEOS Investments Partnership following
the sale by INEOS Investments Partnership of its assets (shares in PQ Corporation) to INEOS Limited, a
related party, for €260.5 million ($296.5 million) which resulted in a profit on disposal of €2.6 million.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit
through future taxable profits is probable based on an assessment of expected future profits modelled
against the gross tax losses. The Group did not recognise gross deductible temporary or tax losses of
€123.8 million (2019: €95.9 million, 2018: €12.0 million) due to uncertainty in respect of the timing realisation.
As at 31 December 2020 there are also unprovided foreign tax credits of €32.7 million.

The Group has not provided deferred tax in relation to temporary differences on its overseas
subsidiaries or joint ventures as the Group can control the timing and realisation of these temporary
differences, and it is probable that no material unprovided tax liability would arise.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020**

_(forming part of the financial statements)_

**18. TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES (continued)**

The accounts receivable not yet due after impairment losses as of the end of the reporting period
are deemed to be collectible on the basis of established credit management processes such as regular
analyses of the credit worthiness of our customers and external credit checks where appropriate for new
customers (see Note 25.c). At December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 there were no significant trade, related party
or other receivable balances not past due that were subsequently impaired.

Due to the global activities and diversified customer structure of the Group, there is no significant
concentration of credit risk (2019: nil, 2018: nil).

During 2018, 2019 and 2020 there were no significant trade, related party or other receivable
balances that were subject to renegotiation of terms. Credit enhancements are held in respect of trade and
other receivables in the form of €nil (2019: €nil, 2018: €9.0 million) of assets pledged as security against
amounts owed to the Group of which €nil (2019: €nil, 2018: €3.9 million) is in respect of amounts falling
overdue.

Trade receivable balances totalling €776.4 million (2019: €770.0 million, 2018: €921.2 million) have
been pledged as security against amounts drawn down under the Receivables Securitisation Facility,
described in Note 19, totalling €114.2 million (2019: €297.1 million, 2018: €287.8 million). In accordance
with IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ the trade receivable balances pledged as security do not qualify for
derecognition and are included within the trade receivable balances above.

The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables during the year was
as follows:

The allowance account for trade receivables is used to record any impairment losses unless the
Group is satisfied that no recovery of the amount owing is probable; at that point the amounts considered
irrecoverable are written off against the trade receivables directly. As of January 1, 2018, IFRS 9 replaced the
‘incurred loss’ model in IAS 39 with a forward-looking ‘expected credit loss’ (ECL) model in assessing the
recoverability of trade receivables. Due to the quality of the Group’s trade receivables, and its low history of
bad debts the application of IFRS 9 did not result in a material change to the allowance for impairment in
respect of trade receivables. The impact was calculated considering past experience and management’s estimate
of future developments including the assessment of probability of default being relatively low. Management
expects no considerable change in the future market situation. Consequently, the future credit losses in
the ECL model are in the same range as the credit losses experienced in the past years. This is regarded as
the future expectation of the inherent credit risk of the not impaired trade and other receivables outstanding.
The Group reviews the assumptions of the ECL model on a yearly basis.

**18. TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES (continued)**

The credit risk grade is based on the analysis on both the quantitative and qualitative factors as
detailed below:

    - High: Customers under significant financial difficulty and customers for whom there is an
uncertainty of payment based on knowledge of factors like insolvency, dispute. Any receivable
more than 180 days past due should also be classified in this category.

    - Medium: Any receivable between 90 and 180 days past due should be classified as medium risk
unless qualitative factors indicate a higher credit risk.

    - Low: Any receivable less than 90 days past due should be classified as low risk unless qualitative
factors indicate a higher credit risk.

During the year the Group has not experienced a significant deterioration in the quality of
receivable balances due to the current economic conditions.

There were no allowances made against amounts due from other receivables during the year (2019:
€nil, 2018: €nil).

There were no allowances made against amounts due from related parties during the year (2019:

The Senior Secured Term Loans outstanding at December 31, 2020 before issue costs were
€3,682.3 million (2019: €3,470.9 million, 2018: €3,476.7 million) of which €37.8 million (2019: €35.4 million,
2018: €35.1 million) is due within one year. The total amounts outstanding on the Euro denominated

Secured Term Loans issued in October 2020 of €375 million mature on October 27, 2027 with the remaining
Term Loans maturing on March 31, 2024.

**21. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS**

**_Pension plans_**

The Group operates a number of pension plans throughout the world, devised in accordance with
local conditions and practices. The plans are generally of the defined benefit type and are funded by
payments to separately administered funds or insurance companies. The principal funded plans are in the
United Kingdom, North America, Belgium, Norway and Switzerland.

The Group also operates a number of unfunded defined benefit pension schemes in Germany and
France.

The most recent full valuations of the significant defined benefit plans were carried out as follows:

**Plan** **Country** **Valuation date**
All Plans . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . United Kingdom 5 April 2019 and 31 December 2019

All Plans . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Switzerland 31 December 2020

These valuations have been updated where appropriate to December 31, 2020 by independent
qualified actuaries.

The Group’s pension schemes have been disclosed on a geographical basis as those schemes in the
United Kingdom, North America and Other European. Other European principally includes the Group’s
pension plans in Germany, Belgium, Norway, France and Switzerland.

The UK defined benefit pension plans were historically final salary in nature, with a normal
retirement age of 60. The majority of the UK plans are either closed to new entrants, or frozen to future
accrual. The plans operate under trust law and are managed and administered by Trustees in accordance with
the terms of each plan’s Trust Deed and Rules and relevant legislation. The contributions paid to the UK
plans are set every three years based on a funding agreement between the company and Trustee after taking
actuarial advice.

The North American pension arrangements consist of two funded plans, both closed to new
entrants and future accrual. Both plans were final salary defined benefit in nature, and the plans’ liabilities

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020**

_(forming part of the financial statements)_

**21. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (continued)**

are valued regularly in line with US statutory funding requirements. Around 90% of both plans’ assets are
invested in bond instruments, to closely match the profile of each plan’s liabilities.

The Other European pension arrangements are primarily final salary in nature, the majority of
which remain open to new entrants. The Norwegian and Swiss benefits are insured, the Belgian plan assets
are held in trust, and the remaining schemes are unfunded with associated provisions held on the Group’s
balance sheet.

**_Pension plan assumptions_**

The principal actuarial assumptions (expressed as weighted averages or ranges) at the year end
were as follows:

**United Kingdom** **North America** **Other European**
**2020** **2019** **2018** **2020** **2019** **2018** **2020** **2019** **2018**

The assumptions relating to longevity underlying the pension liabilities at the reporting date are
based on standard actuarial mortality tables and include an allowance for future improvements in longevity.
The assumptions are equivalent to expecting a 65-year old to live for a number of years as follows:

**United Kingdom** **North America** **Other European**
**2020** **2019** **2018** **2020** **2019 o** **2018** **2020** **2019** **2018**

The following table presents the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to each significant
actuarial assumption:

**United** **North** **Other**
**Kingdom** **America** **European**
**2020**
**%**
**Major assumptions**
Discount rate: 1.0% decrease . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 21.1 14.3 20.9
Rate of inflation: 0.5% increase[(1)] . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7.1 N/A 4.8
One year increase in longevity for a member currently aged 65 . . . . . . . . . . . 4.2 0.7 3.0

(1) The sensitivity to the inflation assumption change includes corresponding changes to the future salary increase and future
pension increase assumptions where these assumptions are set to be linked to the inflation assumption.

**_Post-retirement health care plans_**

The Group also operates a number of post-retirement healthcare plans in the United States, which
provide employees with other post-employment benefits in respect of health care. The plans are unfunded
and

the liability in respect of these benefits is included in provisions. The liability is assessed by
qualified independent actuaries under the projected unit method, assuming the following rates:

**_Severance and restructuring costs_**

The severance and restructuring costs provision includes €22.1 million relating to the Köln site
following a reorganisation within the O&P North business in 2015 and is expected to be fully utilised by
2027.

In December 2019 the Group took the decision to close the Nitriles facility at Seal Sands, United
Kingdom. The severance and restructuring costs provision includes €6.1 million in respect of remaining
closure costs including severance and outplacement expenses. The provision is expected to be fully utilised
within the next two years.

**_Remediation costs_**

The Group has provided for the cost of remediation works of €13.5 million where there is a legal
or constructive obligation for such work to be carried out. Provisions are established to meet the clean-up
costs of contaminated soil and groundwater, the removal of potentially hazardous substances and rectification
work required to ensure compliance with license to operate obligations. These costs relate mainly to the
Group’s production facilities at the Köln, Chocolate Bayou, Green Lake and Lima sites and a pilot plant at
the Lavera site. The provision only covers items of specific work for which a reasonable estimate can be
determined. By their nature the amounts and timing of any outflows in respect of remediation costs are
difficult to predict.

In December 2019 the Group took the decision to close the Nitriles facility at Seal Sands, United
Kingdom. The remediation provision includes €12.8 million in respect of decommissioning and demolition
costs. The provision is expected to be fully utilised within the next two years.

**_Other provisions_**

Other provisions primarily relates to a commercial disputes in respect of a licencing agreement and
are expected to be fully utilised within the next three years.

is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the
reporting date.

Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income are accounted for at fair value
based on the present value of future cash flows where such information is readily available based on the
present value of future cash flows estimated from financial information made available during the year as a
result of a recent transaction in the investment. However, as explained in Note 14, the Group’s financial
assets at fair value through other comprehensive income include certain equity interests which are not quoted
and for which there is no active market. The Group considers that the acquisition cost to be a reasonable
approximation for fair value.

**_Trade and other receivables_**

The carrying amount of trade and other receivables generally approximates to fair value due to
their short maturities. Where settlement is not due in the short term and where the effect is material, fair
value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows discounted at the market rate of interest at the
reporting date.

**_Trade and other payables_**

The carrying amount of trade and other payables generally approximates to fair value due to their
short maturities. Where settlement is not due in the short term and where the effect is material, fair value is
estimated as the present value of future cash flows discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting
date.

**_Cash and cash equivalents_**

The fair value of cash and cash equivalents is estimated as its carrying amount where the cash is
repayable on demand. Where it is not repayable on demand then the fair value is estimated at the present
value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.

**_Interest-bearing borrowings_**

The fair value of the Senior Secured Term Loans, Senior Secured Notes and Senior Notes, which
after initial recognition is determined for disclosure purposes only are based on the market yields derived

from quotes obtained at the year end from leading financial institutions. The fair value of the Receivables
and Inventory Securitisation, Rafnes Facility, Schuldschein Loan, Köln CoGen Facility, Gemini Facility and
Other loans is the same as the carrying value before unamortised debt issue costs.

**_Derivative financial instruments_**

The fair value of interest rate swaps and commodity contracts are based on market or broker
quotes.

**_Fair values_**

The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The
different levels, determined in accordance with IFRS 13 “Fair Value Measurement”, have been defined as
follows:

    - Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

    - Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the
asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and

    - Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data
(unobservable inputs).

The commodity derivatives are fair valued using rates in a quoted market. There have been no
transfers between any levels in 2020 (2019 and 2018: no transfers between levels).

**25b Net gains and losses from financial instruments**

Net gains and losses from financial instruments comprise the results of valuations, the amortisation
of discounts, the recognition and derecognition of impairment losses, results from the translation of foreign
currencies, interest, dividends and all effects on profit or loss of financial instruments.

Net gains from financial assets measured at amortised cost relate primarily to recognition and
derecognition of impairment losses, results from the translation of foreign currencies and interest income.

Net losses from financial liabilities measured at amortised cost relate primarily to amortisation of
discounts, results from the translation of foreign currencies, interest expense and other financing related
expenses.

The item ‘financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss’ comprise valuation gains and
losses, and only includes gains and losses from instruments which are not designated as hedging instruments
as defined by IFRS 9.

**25c Credit risk**

**_Financial risk management_**

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial
instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from
customers, deposits with financial institutions and derivatives.

Group Treasury policy and objectives in relation to credit risk is to minimize the likelihood that the
Group will experience financial loss due to counterparty failure and to ensure that in the event of a single
loss, the failure of any single counterparty would not materially impact the financial wellbeing of the Group.

**_Trade and other receivables_**

The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each
customer. However, management also considers the demographics of the Group’s customer base, including
the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, as these factors may have an
influence on credit risk. Management considers that there is no geographical concentration of credit risk.
The Group has established a credit policy under which each new customer is analysed individually for
creditworthiness before the Group’s standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered or are
adjusted accordingly. The Group’s review includes external ratings, when available, and in some cases
bank references. Purchase limits are established for each customer, which represent the maximum open
amount without requiring approval. Customers that fail to meet the Group’s benchmark creditworthiness
may transact with the Group only on a prepayment basis.

**_Investments, cash and cash equivalent_**

Surplus cash investments are only made with banks with which the Group has a relationship.

**_Guarantees_**

The Group’s policy is to provide financial guarantees only to wholly-owned subsidiaries. At
December 31, 2020 no guarantees were outstanding (2019: none, 2018: none).

**_Exposure to credit risk_**

The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. Therefore, the
maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was the carrying amount of financial assets. Further
details on the Group’s exposure to credit risk are given in Note 18.

**25d Liquidity risk**

**_Financial risk management_**

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall
due. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020**

_(forming part of the financial statements)_

**25. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)**

sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under normal and stressed conditions, without incurring
unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group. The Group’s exposure to liquidity risk is limited by
the fact that it operates with significant cash resources, and it maintains the most appropriate mix of short,
medium and long-term borrowings from the Group’s lenders.

The Group is reliant on committed funding from a variety of sources at Group and subsidiary
company level to meet the anticipated needs of the Group for the period covered by the Group’s budget.

The Group forecasts on a regular basis the expected cash flows that will occur on a weekly and
monthly basis. This information is used in conjunction with the weekly reporting of actual cash balances at
bank in order to calculate the level of funding that will be required in the short and medium term. On a
monthly basis the level of headroom on existing facilities is reported and forecast forward until the end of
the financial period.

In addition, the Group maintains various lines of credits in the form of Senior Notes, Senior
Secured Notes, Senior Secured Term Loans, Securitisation, Rafnes Facility, Köln CoGen Facility, Gemini
Facility and Other loans. (See Note 19—“Interest-Bearing Loans and Borrowings” for more information).

The Group does not have derivative commodity contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges at
December 31, 2020.

The Group has U.S. Dollar and Sterling financial liabilities in respect of the Senior Notes and
Securitisation Facility that are designated net investment hedges of U.S. Dollar and Sterling operations in
accordance with the requirements of IFRS 9. The U.S. Dollar and Sterling net investment hedges had a
carrying value and fair value as follows:

For the year ended December 31, 2020 losses net of tax of €527.4 million were taken directly to
reserves and reported in the Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year then ended (2019: gains
€88.0 million, 2018: gains €271.3 million). There was no ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement
for the year ended December 31, 2020 (2019: €nil, 2018: €nil). The cumulative net investment hedge reserve
amount as at December 31, 2020 was €(36.5) million (2019: €490.9 million, 2018: €402.9 million).

**25f Market risk**

**_Financial risk management_**

Market risk reflects the possibility that changes in market prices, such as crude oil, feedstock
refined products, chemicals or currency exchange rates or changes in interest rates will adversely affect the
value of the Group’s assets, liabilities or expected future cash flows. The Group holds commodity contracts
in order to manage market risk. The use of derivative instruments is confined to specialist teams that have
the appropriate skills, experience, supervision, control and reporting systems.

**_Market risk—Foreign currency risk_**

The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various
currency exposures, primarily with respect to the U.S. Dollar and Sterling.

Foreign exchange risk arises from net investments in foreign operations, future commercial
transactions, and recognised assets and liabilities.

The Group applies hedge accounting to foreign currency differences arising on the retranslation of
a financial liability designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. When the settlement of
a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation is neither planned nor likely in the
foreseeable future, foreign exchange gains and losses arising from such a monetary item is considered to
form part of a net investment in a foreign operation and changes in the fair value are recognised directly
within equity.

A substantial portion of the Group’s revenue is generated in, or linked to, the U.S. dollar and the
euro. In the European petrochemical business, product prices, certain feedstock costs and most other costs
are denominated in euro and sterling. In the U.S. petrochemical and specialty chemicals businesses, product
prices, raw materials costs and most other costs are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars.

The Group generally does not enter into foreign currency exchange instruments to hedge foreign
currency transaction exposure, although the Group has done so in the past and may do so in the future.

The Group benefits from natural hedging, to the extent that currencies in which net cash flows are
generated from the Group’s operations, are matched against long-term indebtedness.

The foreign currency exposure where the Group’s external financial assets/(liabilities) are not
denominated in the functional currency of the operating unit involved is shown below. Foreign exchange
differences on retranslation of these assets and liabilities are taken to the other comprehensive income of the
Group.

This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant
and considers the effect of financial instruments with variable interest rates, financial instrument at fair
value through profit or loss or available for sale with fixed interest rates and the fixed rate element of interest
rate caps. The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2020, 2019 and 2018.

A 1% change in the opposite direction of the above interest rates at December 31, would have had
the equal but opposite effect on the above currencies to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all
other variables remain constant.

**Market risk—Commodity price risk**

This section discusses the Group’s exposure to the commodity contracts which are not covered
under the own use exemption and are recognised as derivative instruments.

The Group and its Refining joint venture are exposed to commodity price risk through fluctuations
in raw material prices and sales of products. The raw material exposures result primarily from the price of
crude oil and base chemicals linked to the price of crude. The sales price exposures are primarily related to
petrochemicals where prices are in general linked to the market price of crude oil.

The Group enters into contracts to supply or acquire physical volumes of commodities at future
dates during the normal course of business that may be considered derivative contracts. Where such
contracts exist and are in respect of the normal purchase or sale of products to fulfil the Group’s
requirements, the own use exemption from derivative accounting is applied.

The Group manages commodity price exposures through trading refined products and chemical
feedstock and using commodity swaps, options and futures as a means of managing price and timing risks.
In 2020 there was a net mark to market derivative liability in respect of commodity contracts of
€57.6 million entered into by the Group to manage such risk (2019: net derivative liability of €44.2 million,
2018: net derivative asset of €9.7 million).

The Group operates within procedures and policies designed to ensure that risks, including those
relating to the default of counterparties, are minimised.

**_Market risk—Equity price risk_**

The Group’s exposure to equity price risk arises from its investment in equity securities which are
classified as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income. These financial assets are
accounted for at fair value based on the present value of future cash flows where such information is readily
available.

For the financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income a 10 percent increase and
decrease in transaction prices at the reporting date would have decreased and increased the loss for the year
by €2.8 million (2019: €2.8 million, 2018: €2.8 million). Management consider that a change of 10 percent
gives an appropriate benchmark to assess the risks that the Group is expected to be exposed to. This calculation
assumes that the change occurred at the reporting date and had been applied to risk exposures existing at
that date. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.

**Capital management**

The Group’s objectives for managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a
going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to
maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

**25. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)**

The Group defines its capital employed of €7,701.2 million (2019: €7,326.3 million, 2018:
€7,077.2 million) as shareholders’ equity of €1,461.6 million (2019: €1,456.4 million, 2018: €2,845.9 million)
and net debt (net of debt issue costs) of €6,239.6 million (2019: €5,869.9 million, 2018: €4,231.3 million).

The principal sources of debt available to the Group at December 31, 2020 include the Senior
Secured Term Loans, Senior Secured Notes due March 2026, Senior Secured Notes due May 2026, Senior
Secured Notes due 2025, Senior Notes due 2024, Receivables Securitisation Facility, Inventory Financing
Facility, Schuldschein Loan, Rafnes Facility, Köln CoGen Facility and the Gemini Facility and are
described in Note 19 along with the key operating and financial covenants that apply to these facilities.

In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends
paid to shareholders, issue new shares, raise new debt or sell assets to reduce debt. The ability of the Group
to pay dividends and provide appropriate facilities to the Group is restricted by the terms of principal
financing agreements to which members of the Group are party.

The Group has entered into a number of significant lease arrangements relating to shipping
capacity in respect of the supply chain activities for the European cracker assets. These leases typically run
for a period of between 10 and 15 years with options to extend after that date.

The Group does not face a significant liquidity risk with regard to its lease liabilities. Lease
liabilities are monitored within the Group’s treasury function.

**29. RELATED PARTIES**

**_Identity of related parties with which the Group has transacted_**

Related parties comprise:

    - Parent entities and their subsidiaries not included within the INEOS Group Holdings S.A.
group;

    - Entities controlled by the shareholders of INEOS Limited, the ultimate parent company of
INEOS Group Holdings S.A.;

    - Key management personnel; and

     - Joint ventures.

Mr JA Ratcliffe, Mr AC Currie and Mr J Reece are shareholders in INEOS Limited.

INEOS Limited and INEOS AG, a subsidiary of INEOS Limited, provide operational management
services to the Group through a management services agreement. Management fees of €90.5 million (2019:
€88.0 million, 2018: €85.7 million) were charged to the income statement. As at December 31, 2020 there
were no amounts owed to INEOS AG (2019: €23.1 million, 2018: €22.0 million). As at December 31, 2020
there were no amounts owed to INEOS Holdings AG, a wholly owned subsidiary of INEOS AG (2019:
€0.9 million, 2018: nil). As at December 31, 2020 amounts owed by INEOS Holdings AG were €28.3 million
(2019: nil, 2018: €0.4 million).

In March 2019 the Group received €260.5 million of proceeds in relation to the repayment of the
Group’s preferential interest in INEOS Investments Partnership following the sale by INEOS Investments
Partnership of its assets (shares in PQ Corporation) to INEOS Limited. The Group paid the proceeds received
as part of a dividend of €296.3 million to its parent company, INEOS Holdings Luxembourg S.A..

INEOS Limited owns and controls a number of operating subsidiaries that are not included in
the INEOS Group Holdings S.A. group, including INEOS Industries Limited (which from December 31,
2020 includes INOVYN Limited and from September 1, 2017 includes the Grangemouth petrochemical
subsidiaries), INEOS Enterprises Holdings Limited and the Lavéra petrochemical assets and businesses
together with other French and Italian assets of INEOS O&P South.

During the year ended December 31, 2020 the Group has made sales to these subsidiaries of
€1,044.7 million (2019: €1,316.1 million, 2018: €1,528.9 million), recovered net costs of €141.4 million
(2019: €77.9 million, 2018: €115.0 million) and made purchases of €1,031.3 million (2019: €1,315.2 million,
2018: €1,489.1 million). As at December 31, 2020, €374.2 million (2019: €471.1 million, 2018: €465.0 million)

(excluding the Grangemouth shareholder loan and the INEOS Upstream Limited loan).

During 2015 the Group provided a loan of $623.7 million to INEOS Upstream Limited, a related
party, in connection with its acquisition of natural gas assets in the North Sea. The loan facility is unsecured
and matures in June 2024 and bears interest at 7% per annum. On September 29, 2017, INEOS Upstream
Limited, a related party, acquired further natural gas assets in the North Sea through its acquisition of the
entire oil and gas business of DONG Energy A/S. In connection with the DONG Acquisition, the Group
advanced a loan of $376.2 million (€315.7 million) to INEOS Upstream Limited, the proceeds of which were

**29. RELATED PARTIES (continued)**

assets and businesses which were divested by the Group on July 1, 2014 and the refining joint ventures
between PetroChina and INEOS Investments (Jersey) Limited, a related party. Previous to becoming a fully
owned subsidiary on December 31, 2020 (see Note 3) the Group had a joint venture with Sasol Limited to
build and operate a HDPE plant at Battleground site in Texas, USA which became operational at the end of
2017.

During the year ended December 31, 2020 the Group made sales of €0.1 million (2019: €0.1 million,
2018: €0.1 million), recovered costs of €0.2 million (2019: €0.5 million, 2018: nil) and made purchases of
€0.2 million (2019: €0.2 million, 2018: nil) from the French joint ventures. As at December 31, 2020
€0.1 million (2019: €0.3 million, 2018: €0.1 million) was owed by the French joint ventures and no amount

€5.6 million was owed by and €5.1 million was owed to (2018: €5.1 million was owed by) the HDPE joint
venture.

The Group has entered into a number of derivative contracts with INEOS UK SNS Limited and
INEOS Energy Trading Limited, both related parties. The net fair value loss on these derivatives during the
year ended December 31, 2020 was €126.2 million (2019: €80.3 million). As at December 31, 2020, the
mark to market derivative asset was €17.8 million (2019: €15.3 million) and the mark to market liability was
€88.0 million (2019: €54.5 million) in respect of these related party derivative financial instruments (see
Note 15).

**_Compensation to key management personnel (including directors)_**

The Group defines key management as the directors of the Company. Details of Directors’
remuneration are given in Note 7.

**30. ULTIMATE PARENT UNDERTAKING AND CONTROLLING PARTY**

The immediate parent undertaking is INEOS Holdings Luxembourg S.A.. The ultimate parent
undertaking at December 31, 2020 was INEOS Limited, a company registered in the Isle of Man. The
ultimate controlling party is Mr JA Ratcliffe, director and majority shareholder of the ultimate parent
undertaking. INEOS Group Holdings S.A. and its subsidiaries are not included within any other consolidated
financial statements.

**31. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS**

The Group prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRSs, which require
management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions which affect the application of the accounting
policies, and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ
from these estimates. The estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to
accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates change and in any future periods.

**Critical accounting judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies**

The key accounting judgement taken in the preparation of these financial statements relates to our
interest in the refining business formerly owned by Group (see Note 12). The refining business is now


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020**

_(forming part of the financial statements)_

**31. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS (continued)**

owned by PetroChina and INEOS Investments (Jersey) Limited (“II(J)L”), which in turn is held under
common control by the Group’s controlling Shareholders. The Group has an economic interest in II(J)L
via non-voting ordinary shares in II(J)L.

The Group has evaluated its interest in II(J)L and in the refining business, and has concluded that
it has effective control over II(J)L by virtue of the facts that the Group is subject to exposure and rights to
the variable returns from II(J)L, II(J)L is held under common control with the Group’s controlling shareholder
and has the same directors as the Group. As a result, II(J)L is treated as a subsidiary of the Group, and
therefore the refining business is treated as a joint venture under the equity accounting method, and the
company reflects its 50% share in the profits and losses of the refining business in its income statement. (see
also Note 1, Accounting policies).

**Key sources of estimated uncertainty**

Estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that the
Group believe are reasonable, including assets and expected economic conditions, and in certain cases
actuarial assumption. Although these estimates are based on the Group’s knowledge of current events and
circumstances, actual numbers may differ.

**_Taxation_**

Management is required to estimate the tax payable in each of the jurisdictions in which the Group
operates. This involves estimating the actual current tax charge or credit together with assessing temporary
differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. The calculation of the
Group’s total tax charge necessarily involves a significant degree of estimation in respect of certain items

whose tax treatment cannot be finally determined until resolution has been reached with the
relevant tax authority, or, as appropriate, through a formal legal process.

The Group has, from time to time, contingent tax liabilities arising from trading and corporate
transactions in the countries in which it operates. After appropriate consideration, management makes
provision for these liabilities based on the probable level of economic loss that may be incurred and which
is reliably measurable.

The breadth of the Group’s structure with operations in many geographic locations makes the use
of estimates and assumptions more challenging. The resolution of issues is not always within the control of
the Group and can be reliant upon the efficiency of the legal processes in the relevant jurisdictions in
which the Group operates, and as a result, issues can, and often do take many years to resolve.

Details of amounts recognised with regard to taxation are disclosed in Notes 9 and 16. Note 9 shows
tax adjustments in respect of prior years of €105.0 million which primarily relates to the carry back of
losses, although material adjustments may arise in future years.

**_Defined benefit obligations_**

The Group operates a number of defined benefit post employment schemes. Under IAS 19 Revised
Employee Benefits, management is required to estimate the present value of the future defined benefit
obligation of each of the defined benefit schemes. The costs and year end obligations under defined benefit
schemes are determined using actuarial valuations. The actuarial valuations involve making numerous
assumptions, with the most significant being:

     - Inflation rate projections;

     - Discount rate for scheme liabilities; and

     - Mortality levels.

The assumptions are based on the environment in each country and vary year to year, with
changes impacting net income and net assets. Changes to some of these assumptions, in particular the

**31. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS (continued)**

discount rate and inflation rate, could result in material changes to the carrying amounts of the Group’s postretirement benefit obligations within the next financial year. Any differences between these assumptions
and the actual outcome will impact future net income and net assets.

Details of post-retirement benefits and sensitivity to each significant assumption are set out in
Note 21.
