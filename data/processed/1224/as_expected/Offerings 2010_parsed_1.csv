1224_1,Offerings 2010.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Overview,9.1.1,,"We are one of the world’s largest chemical companies as measured by revenue and have highly integrated, world-class chemical facilities and production technologies. We have leading global market positions for a majority of our key products, a strong customer base and an experienced management team. We operate 37 manufacturing sites in 9 countries throughout the world, including two refineries in Europe which are fully integrated with our colocated petrochemical facilities. As of December 31, 2009, our total chemical production capacity was approximately 24,000 kilotonnes per year, of which 71% was in Europe and 29% was in North America. Our refineries have a combined crude oil distillation capacity of more than 410,000 barrels per day. We operate our business through four segments: Refining, Olefins & Polymers Europe, Olefins & Polymers North America and Chemical Intermediates. The products we manufacture are derived from crude oil and natural gas, and include refined products, olefins, polymers and various petrochemical products directly or indirectly derived from olefins. Our products serve a broad and diverse range of end markets, including transport and heating fuels, packaging, construction, automotive, white goods/durables, agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals. Our highly integrated production facilities allow us to process raw materials into higher value-added products. We own five sites integrated with crackers and polymer units, of which two are integrated with our refineries. Typically, these account for approximately 80% of our olefin and polymer volumes and 100% of our refining volumes. In Europe, approximately 80%, of our ethylene and propylene output is typically sold internally. Our four European polyolefins sites receive more than 95% of their feedstock supply from our integrated crackers. Similarly, in the United States, much of our olefin feedstock requirements for our polymer business is supplied by either our Chocolate Bayou cracker in Texas, or by integrated third-party crackers, such as the BP Carson facility in California. We believe that with our highly integrated facilities we are able to capture attractive margins across the value chain, enjoy greater certainty of feedstock supply, reduce logistical costs, improve energy management and optimize our product slate. We benefit from the cost advantages of operating large-scale, well-invested, highly integrated facilities strategically located near major transportation facilities and customer locations. Since January 1, 2001, we and our predecessors have invested more than €1.5 billion in our production facilities to ensure that they operate efficiently, resulting in integrated, state-of-the-art production units. We believe this allows us to operate at lower cost and higher utilization rates than most of our competitors, and enables us to maintain positive margin and cash flows even during downturns in industry cycles or customer demand. For the year ended December 31, 2009, our revenue was €18.1 billion and our EBITDA before exceptionals was €1.2 billion. Over the past several years, we have implemented a range of strategic initiatives designed to lower our operating costs, increase our profitability and further enhance our market position. These include fixed asset investments to expand our capacity in higher value products, enhance productivity at our existing facilities and significantly reduce our fixed cost structure through head count reductions, production line closures and system upgrades. Between 2006 and 2009, fixed costs were reduced by approximately € 450 million. We have shifted our product portfolio to focus on more differentiated products, exited low-margin businesses and implemented premium pricing strategies designed to improve our margins. We believe these initiatives provide us with a strong platform to drive growth, create significant operating leverage and position us to benefit from eventual volume recovery in our end markets. 1 ----- Since April 1998, when INEOS was established with the acquisition of the Belgian “Oxide” assets from Inspec plc, we have significantly expanded, both through a series of strategic acquisitions of businesses and assets from major chemical companies, and through organic growth. The combination of INEOS and Innovene in December 2005 represented a transformational acquisition for our company, providing global scale and further upstream integration. During 2007, we acquired the Borealis petrochemical manufacturing business in Norway. In 2008, we acquired the former BP vinyl acetate monomer/ethyl acetate business in Hull, UK and the former BASF acrylonitrile business in Seal Sands, UK. In 2009, we transferred certain companies and businesses out of the INEOS Group to INEOS Industries Holdings Ltd. These businesses had consumed a significant amount of cash in the prior three years and were forecast to continue to be a significant drain on cash resources (due to either difficult trading conditions or requiring significant investment over the next two to three years). The transferred businesses comprised the ABS, Styrenics, Melamines, Healthcare, Bio and Films Italia Srl businesses, together with our shareholding in the INEOS Nova JV. In 2010, we sold our businesses associated with the production of chlor-akali and PVC and our business associated with fluorochemicals.

Each has a crude oil distillation capacity of over 200,000 barrels per day and, unusually for European refineries that tend to be gasoline oriented, are configured with hydrocracking units enabling high middle distillate production from vacuum gasoil (VGO). This configuration is suited towards the anticipated high growth of European middle distillate demand and consumption relative to gasoline consumption. 3 ----- The Grangemouth refinery is connected by pipeline to both the Forties Pipeline System (FPS) and to the Finnart deep water terminal on the west coast of Scotland. This allows the refinery to consume freight-free Forties blend in tandem with commercially attractive crudes from the global market. The Lavéra refinery, located in the Mediterranean basin adjacent to the key crude import hub of Fos, provides it with good access to various types of crude feed, including from the Urals, the Caspian Sea, North and West Africa and the Middle East. Both refineries benefit from efficient product placement to premium local markets through road and rail, racks, local product pipelines as well as shipping terminals. Both also have deepwater shipping facilities enabling large vessel import/export capability. Both refineries are integrated with our owned and JV petrochemical assets at the Grangemouth and Lavéra sites. Coupled with our recent entry into the northern UK and French wholesale markets, the refineries now place the majority of output with inland consumers. Both of our refineries meet current EU clean fuel specifications. _Olefins & Polymers Europe and Olefins & Polymers North America_ In our olefins and polymers businesses, we produce olefins and a broad range of polyolefin polymers. We are among the largest producers of olefins and polymers in the world. The focus of our olefins business in Europe and North America is on ethylene and propylene, which are the two largest volume olefins globally and are key building blocks for polymers. The olefins we make are primarily used as feedstock for our polymers businesses. In addition, we sell olefins to third-party customers for a variety of industrial and consumer applications, including the manufacture of plastics, rubber and fiber. The focus of our polymers business is on polyethylene and polypropylene. We operate a total of 13 sites for olefins and polyolefins, including our large integrated olefins cracker and polyolefin facilities at Köln (Germany), Grangemouth (UK), Lavéra (France), Rafnes (Norway) and Chocolate Bayou (USA). These facilities support our highly competitive proprietary polyolefin process technologies, which are also marketed and licensed by our INEOS Technologies business in cooperation with our olefins and polymers businesses. The technologies include our cost-effective gas phase polypropylene technology, our specialized technology for high-density polyethylene and our flexible proprietary “swing” technology for both linear lowdensity and high-density polyethylene. The North American and European markets for olefins and polyolefins are quite distinct, with separate pricing structures and distribution channels. As a result, each market may experience different rates of growth and levels of return. Therefore, we operate these two businesses separately and report them as two distinct segments— INEOS Olefins & Polymers Europe and INEOS Olefins & Polymers North America. _Chemical Intermediates_ Chemical intermediates are higher-value-added chemical products used as key components in a wide variety of consumer and industrial products. In our chemical intermediates business, we utilize olefins as key raw materials. The four main product groups within our chemical intermediates business are INEOS Nitriles, INEOS Oligomers, INEOS Oxide and INEOS Phenol. The activities of INEOS Enterprises, INEOS Films and INEOS Technologies are also included within the chemical intermediates business. Together these businesses produce a wide range of products including phenol, acetone, alpha olefins, synthetic ethanol, ethylene oxide and derivatives, acrylonitrile, ammonia, nitric acid and polymer films. We manufacture chemical intermediates in 26 locations globally, with many of our plants integrated either directly with their key raw materials on site, or integrated via pipeline connection. We are the world’s leading producer of phenol, which is an essential starting material for a wide range of applications in the electrical/electronics, automotive, construction and household/furniture industries. Our main product in the nitriles sector is acrylonitrile, which is used in the production of acrylic fibers and acrylonitrile 4 ----- butadiene styrene plastic. We are also among the largest volume suppliers of linear and poly alpha olefins in the world. We are the largest producer of ethylene oxide in Western Europe and have a range of associated products including ethylene glycol, propylene oxide, propylene glycol and acetate esters. As referenced above, through INEOS Technologies, we are a leading developer and licensor of technologies to the global petrochemical industry including not only technologies for the manufacturing of polyolefins, but also those for polystyrene, nitriles, maleic anhydride, ethylene dichloride and polyvinyl chloride, and chlor-alkali. In addition, we manufacture high-quality catalysts and additives for use with these technologies which we supply to licensees and other companies around the world, and also to our own manufacturing assets.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

We are one of the world’s largest chemical companies. We operate 37 manufacturing sites in 9 countries around the world including 2 refineries in Europe, which are fully integrated with our co-located petrochemical facilities. These assets have a total production capacity of approximately 24,000 kilotonnes per year. In addition, our refineries have a combined crude oil distillation capacity of more than 410,000 barrels per day. We believe we have a top 3 or better global or regional market position in 11 of our key products, representing more than 50% of our total sales as measured by volume. Our petrochemical products are utilized in a wide range of end-market applications.

1224_1,Offerings 2010.md,9,SUMMARY,9.7,Group Third Party Revenue by Region 2009,9.7.1,,"We believe that such application and market diversity reduces the effect of industry cyclicality on our results. In addition, we believe that we benefit from the fact that the refining industry cycle and petrochemical industry cycle are independent cycles. For example, during the market downturn that began in the third quarter of 2008, the refining market remained relatively stable, which helped to partially offset the impact of the significant decline in the petrochemical sector. - **_Vertically Integrated, World-Scale Producer._** We have five large-scale petrochemical sites, accounting for 55% of our total petrochemical production volumes. Each of these sites is integrated with a major cracker and/or polymers and derivatives unit, and two of these are also integrated with our own onsite refineries, which differentiates us from many of our competitors. Both of our refineries have crude oil distillation capacity of more than 200,000 barrels per day, which is higher than the average European refinery capacity according to PGI, and each is equipped with a hydrocracker and a fluid catalytic cracker. The crackers provide our refineries with significant flexibility in their ability to process not only low sulphur crude oils, but also heavy, sour crude oils into light, sweet middle distillates (such as road diesel, light gasoils and heavy gasoils). We operate the largest single-site ethylene oxide/ethylene glycol plant in Europe and the two largest phenol plants in Europe, one of which is the largest in the world, as well as the largest single train phenol plant in North America. We operate the largest acrylonitrile facility in the world and one of the largest high-density polyethylene complexes in North America. We believe that, as our production volumes increase, we will be able to leverage our fixed cost base and increase our profitability. Our sites are typically located near raw materials, refineries and associated pipeline infrastructure. We believe our highly integrated facilities provide us with the ability to capture margins across the value chain, enjoy certainty of feedstock supply (particularly for ethylene), reduce logistical costs, improve energy management, adjust the product slate to capture greater value (by selling olefins or, alternatively, by using them internally in the production of polymers or derivatives) and reduce our exposure to margin volatility as a result of changes in raw material prices. We operate large plants that permit us to spread fixed costs over large volumes of production, thereby reducing unit costs and enhancing profits. - **_Well-Invested, Highly Efficient Production Facilities._** Our large, well-invested plants benefit from economies of scale and favorable locations. Our acquisition activity has focused on acquiring businesses that complement our existing manufacturing facilities with well-invested physical assets from major chemical companies. In addition, each year we continue to invest in improving and expanding our facilities. Since January 1, 2001, we and our predecessors have invested more than €1.5 billion in our manufacturing assets to maximize efficiency and create integrated state-of-the-art production units. 6 ----- - **_Extensive Portfolio of Leading Proprietary Technologies. We are a leading developer and licensor of manufacturing technologies for our own use and for the global petrochemical industry. We use our technologies for the manufacturing of our key products, and believe that they enable us to be one of the lowest cost producers and provide us with a significant competitive advantage in terms of product quality. Our proprietary technologies, including our gas phase polyethylene, gas phase polypropylene, slurry high-density polyethylene and acrylonitrile technologies, are positioned around our key products. In addition, our technologies are widely licensed to industry participants and they are often integrated into new chemical plant design and construction. For example, we believe that our acrylonitrile technology is used in more than 90% of the world’s acrylonitrile production capacity. We believe there is significant potential for additional licensing arrangements across our portfolio. We have grown our licensing business market share in all product lines, and on the basis of 2008 and 2009 market shares, we are the leading licensor of polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinylchloride, vinyl chloride monomer, ethylene dichloride and acrylonitrile technologies. Our technology licensing contracts often lead to ongoing relationships to supply high-quality catalysts and additives, and provide on-site support. INEOS engineers are deployed to provide support and collaborate with our licensees to ensure proper technology deployment and performance quality. We believe that our technology licensing business allows us to generate a stable and recurring income stream, and provides us with substantial visibility on potential capacity additions and new projects in the petrochemical industry. - **_Experienced Management Team with a Strong Track Record._** Our senior management team has been operating INEOS and our predecessors for the past 11 years and has a demonstrated track record of achieving profitable growth in the chemical industry, successfully integrating large acquisitions, dramatically reducing the fixed cost base, and deleveraging the business following such acquisitions. James A. Ratcliffe, our controlling shareholder, and the other existing shareholders, have a successful record of investing in the chemical industry. We have completed 19 significant acquisitions since the formation of INEOS in 1998. Each of these acquisitions has been integrated effectively and we have been able to achieve significant cost-savings in the acquired businesses. Our management team has extensive experience in the chemical industry, including with leading companies such as ICI, DuPont, Dow Chemical, Degussa and BP, and a proven ability to increase productivity, reduce costs and control capital expenditures and working capital. We believe the experience of our management team is a distinct competitive advantage and positions us favorably as we continue to grow.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

As a result of our lean corporate structure, we are able to","maintain a level of agility that few organizations our size are able to match. Opportunities for profitable growth are identified and vetted in an efficient, non-bureaucratic format, which, in many cases, we believe enables us to establish a first-mover advantage. We have significant expertise in identifying, executing and integrating acquisitions. During the past 11 years, we have made 19 acquisitions, significantly growing EBITDA. We have a highly disciplined acquisition screening and evaluation process and a detailed series of metrics by which we measure the value creation prospective of potential transactions. Although we have no current plans to complete further acquisitions, as the market environment and our financial position improve, we believe that we are well-positioned to consider transactions that would be consistent with our goal to reduce leverage. We also plan to pursue growth opportunities by leveraging our portfolio of leading proprietary technologies through both our own organic operations and highly selective licensing arrangements. We view technology licensing as an effective way of establishing our products in the market and of generating additional income. In addition, we believe that the ability to offer a comprehensive technology package is a substantial advantage in attracting joint venture partners for equity investments in regions characterized by low feedstock costs and high growth, such as the Middle East, North Africa, Russia and China. Our approach to licensing varies from technology to technology to take into account the prevailing market conditions. For example, licensing of acrylonitrile technology is highly selective, whereas our gas phase polyethylene technology is licensed widely.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455
1224_1,Offerings 2010.md,9,SUMMARY,9.8,Our Business Strategy,9.8.2,,"In response to current challenges resulting from the current macroeconomic environment and as part of our long-term strategic aim, we have maintained and will continue to execute a strategy consisting of the following short- and long-term elements. These are designed to help us improve our capital structure, leverage our key strengths and market opportunities and ensure ongoing cash flow generation and growth: - **_Maintain World-Class Cost Positions, Generate Cost Savings and Enhance Efficiency._** We have historically succeeded in reducing costs at our acquired businesses by making rapid reductions in underlying fixed costs and implementing an efficient corporate and management structure. Continuous improvements in the efficiency of our existing sites and opportunities for site consolidation are key aspects of this strategy, as we seek to maintain upper quartile cost positions and world-scale facilities across the majority of our operations. We have achieved significant fixed cost reductions in businesses that we have acquired, delivering on average a reduction of 22% of inherited fixed costs in the fouryear period post-acquisition. As the economic downturn took effect in the third quarter of 2008, we applied a target of an additional 10% reduction in fixed costs for all of our businesses for the fourth quarter, which we achieved. In 2009, we targeted a further 10% or a €200 million reduction on fixed costs for the year, which we surpassed. Overall, fixed costs were reduced by €450 million between 2006 and 2009. The control of fixed costs will continue to be a key priority for our business. - **_Maintain World-Class Health, Safety and Environmental Excellence._** We are dedicated to continually improving our HSE performance. We ensure that all employees receive appropriate training, thereby enabling them to effectively contribute to HSE performance and HSE improvement 7 ----- processes. It is our policy to design our processes and manufacture and distribute our products in a responsible manner so that our employees, customers, the public and the environment are protected from avoidable risks. Our strategy is to continue achieving injury and environmental compliance ratings better than world-class benchmarks. - **_Continue Current Measures to Achieve and Maintain a Sustainable Capital Structure. - _Generate Strong Cash Flow to Reduce Leverage. We intend to continue our focus on cash flow generation by maximizing the utilization of assets, leveraging existing resources, continuously improving working capital practices and following focused capital expenditure and cost reduction plans. We will apply when possible the cash flows generated from these initiatives to help reduce our debt. - _Focus Capital Investments on Improving Returns._ Our capital expenditure plan is primarily focused on ensuring the safe and compliant status of our plants. We then focus on delivering efficiency improvement projects with attractive payback economics. Since January 1, 2001, we and our predecessors have invested more than €1.5 billion in our manufacturing assets to improve the quality and performance of our businesses. We believe that our technology, personnel and production facilities will allow us to continue to increase our profitability and cash flows without the need for significant additional investments. We will also continue to implement debottlenecking projects at our facilities to increase our production capacity, particularly when the incremental capacity can be achieved without significant additional fixed costs or capital expenditures. - _Deleveraging of Our Capital Structure Through Selective Disposals. We have increased our focus on making selective disposals of assets and non-core businesses in order to reduce our net debt and increase liquidity. We recently sold our INEOS ChlorVinyls Business, which led to a reduction of net debt, the release from the associated pension liabilities, which were assumed by the acquiring entity, and increased liquidity. Additionally, the disposal of our fluorochemicals business reduced our net debt and removed a significant cash investment expense required to develop replacement products. See “—Recent Developments” for a more detailed discussion about the disposal of these former assets. - **_Maximize Utilization of Assets. As a low-cost focused producer, we believe in operating our facilities at full capacity. We believe this allows us to maintain positive margins and cash flows, even during downturns in industry cycles or customer demand, more readily than some of our competitors who have higher production costs. We intend to achieve growth in production volume by improving utilization rates within the defined availability of an asset, improving availability of an asset by minimizing planned and unplanned facility downtime and improving capacity of an asset through debottlenecking projects. We have a strong track record of improving utilization rates of acquired assets. For example, in 2001, the newly acquired INEOS Phenol assets had a utilization rate of 85% of nameplate capacity, which we increased to 103% by 2004. Following the acquisition of Innovene, we closed three of the acquired polyolefin units with a combined capacity of 600 ktpa. Notwithstanding these closures, total capacity utilization on our remaining facilities has grown to more than offset the impact of the closed capacity. - **_Maintain a Lean Corporate Structure and Incentivize Employees. We intend to operate our business consistent with the philosophy of our shareholders and maintain a simple and decentralized, flat organizational structure that minimizes corporate bureaucracy, coupled with compensation arrangements that incentivize our employees. We believe that a simple and decentralized organizational structure is cost effective and will allow each of our management teams the freedom to use their industry knowledge to respond to market opportunities. We believe that we can increase the value of our business when our employees share in the value they create. In the past, we have granted our employees tracking shares with respect to each of our businesses and regions, with management and employee bonuses linked to the EBITDA performance and other factors of the business in which they work. 8 ----- - **_Where and When Appropriate, and Within the Confines of Our Capital Structure, to Pursue Long-",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

This information is based solely on preliminary internal information used by management and our interim unaudited financial statements for the first quarter of 2010 have not been completed. Because this information is preliminary, it could change. We expect that EBITDA before exceptionals for the first quarter of 2010 will be approximately 40% of EBITDA before exceptionals for the year ended December 31, 2009, which approximately doubles the EBITDA before exceptionals achieved in the first quarter of 2009. We expect that consolidated revenues for the first quarter of 2010 will be approximately 30% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009, representing an increase compared to the first quarter of 2009. We expect that refining inventory holding gains in the first quarter of 2010 will be approximately 8% of refining inventory holding gains for the year ended December 31, 2009, representing less than half the corresponding gains in the first quarter of 2009 and reflecting an increase in crude oil prices. We estimate that RC/HC EBITDA before exceptionals for the first quarter of 2010 will be slightly less than 50% of RC/HC EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2009, which approximately trebles the RC/HC EBITDA before exceptionals achieved in the first quarter of 2009. Profitability across our chemical business in the month of March 2010 was particularly strong. We have continued to focus on cash management and liquidity. Net debt as of March 2010 was in line with net debt as of year end 2009. We estimate that cash balances at the end of the quarter will be approximately 12% higher than reported at year end 2009, even after a scheduled payment of interest on the term loans under the Existing Facilities Agreement of €145 million which was made at the end of March 2010, which was more than offset by cash proceeds from the sale of our fluorochemical business to Mexichem of $350 million.

As of December 31, 2009, after giving pro forma effect to this offering, we would have had total consolidated loans and borrowings of € 7,828.8 million as compared to total equity of negative €557.2 million. In addition, we would have had €603.1 million available for future borrowings under the unused portion of our revolving credit facility and Securitization Program. Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to holders of notes by adversely affecting our financial position including, but not limited to: - requiring us to dedicate all of our cash flow from operations (after the payment of operating expenses) to payments with respect to our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures, product research and development, and other general corporate expenditures; - increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, adverse general economic or industry conditions; - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, competition or changes in our business or industry; - limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing; - restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or exploring business opportunities; and - placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that have less debt or greater financial resources. Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our debt obligations, including the notes. Our ability to make payments on and refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash from our operations. Our ability to generate cash from operations is subject, in large part, to general economic, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors and other factors that are beyond our control. We may not be able to generate enough cash flow from operations nor obtain enough capital to service our debt or fund our planned capital expenditures. A portion of our debt (including debt under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Existing Facilities Agreement) bears interest at a variable rate which is based on EURIBOR or LIBOR, as applicable, plus an agreed margin plus certain additional costs. Fluctuations in our borrowing costs may increase our overall debt obligations and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to service our debt obligations. In addition, we may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future, including indebtedness in connection with any future acquisition. The terms of the Indenture, the 2016 Notes Indenture and the Senior Facilities Agreement permit our subsidiaries to do so, in each case, subject to certain limitations. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the risks that we now face could intensify. Moreover, some of the debt we may incur in the future could be structurally senior to the notes and may be secured by collateral that does not secure the notes.

The Senior Facilities Agreement also requires us and some of our subsidiaries to comply with certain affirmative covenants and certain specified financial covenants and ratios. For example, under the Senior Facilities Agreement we will be required to procure that at least € 500 million of the advances under the Senior Facilities Agreement are prepaid by the making of voluntary and/or mandatory prepayments (including pursuant to the asset disposals, equity proceeds and cash sweep mandatory prepayment provision) by no later than the end of 2012.

All of these limitations are or will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants.” The covenants to which we are subject could limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our interest. Our ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control. These include prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If we breach any of these covenants or restrictions, we could be in default under the Senior Facilities Agreement. This would permit the lending banks to take certain actions, including declaring all amounts that we have borrowed under the Senior Facilities Agreement to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. This would also result in an event of default under the Indenture and the 2016 Notes Indenture. The lending banks could also refuse to extend further credit under the revolving credit facility to be made available under the Senior Facilities Agreement. If we are unable to repay our debt to the lending banks, they could proceed against the collateral that secures the debt under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the notes.

We satisfy a significant amount of our short-term liquidity needs with amounts available under the Securitization Program.

This, to an extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors, including those factors discussed in this “Risk Factors” section or elsewhere in this offering memorandum, many of which are beyond our and our subsidiaries’ control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our payment obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay planned expansions or capital expenditures, sell significant assets, discontinue specified operations, obtain additional funding in the form of debt or equity capital or attempt to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity. We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of our debt, including the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Indenture and the 2016 Notes Indenture, will limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives. If we are unsuccessful in any of these efforts, we may not have sufficient cash to meet our obligations.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

In addition, under the terms of the Indenture, we are permitted in the future to incur additional indebtedness and other obligations that may share in the liens on the Collateral securing the notes and the liens on the collateral securing our other secured debt. The Intercreditor Deed provides that a common Security Trustee, who serves as the Security Trustee for the secured parties under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the notes, will (subject to certain limited exceptions) act with respect to such collateral only at the direction of the majority (66[2]/3%) with respect to the then outstanding first-priority secured debt (which excludes creditors in respect of the BP Liabilities and under the Term D Facility and the 2016 Notes and which excludes, until the aggregate amount committed or funded under such first-priority secured debt (excluding the notes and any additional notes) is less than 30% of the aggregate principal amount of all such committed or funded first-priority secured debt (including the notes and any additional notes) for a period of at least 30 days, the notes and any additional notes). At any time following the date falling 30 days after the first-priority secured debt (other than debt under the notes and any additional notes) falls below 30% of the aggregate amount of first-priority secured debt, creditors holding a majority of the aggregate amount of outstanding first-priority secured debt (including the notes and any additional notes) will be able to instruct the security trustee to enforce the security. No noteholder has any separate right to enforce or to require the enforcement of the Collateral. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Deed.” As a result, the holders of the notes will not be able to force a sale of such collateral or otherwise independently pursue the remedies of a secured creditor under the relevant security documents for so long as any amounts under other first- priority senior secured debt remain outstanding in an amount greater than 30% of the aggregate principal amount of total first-priority senior secured debt (including the notes and any additional notes and amounts outstanding under our Senior Facilities Agreement excluding the Term D Facility) (and for 30 days after such proportion falls below 30%). The creditors under our Senior Facilities Agreement may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of the notes and they may not elect to pursue their remedies under the security documents at a time when it would otherwise be advantageous for the holders of the notes to do so. In addition, if the Security Trustee sells the shares of our subsidiaries that have been pledged as Collateral through an enforcement of their security interest in accordance with the Intercreditor Deed, claims under the guarantees of the notes and the liens over any other assets securing the notes and the guarantees may be released. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Deed” and “Description of the Notes—Security.” 36 ----- As a result, until 30 days have passed since the first-priority secured debt (other than debt under the notes and any additional notes) has fallen below 30% of the aggregate amount of first-priority secured debt, lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement (other than lenders under the Term D Facility) will have effective control of all decisions with respect to the Collateral. It is possible that disputes may occur between the holders of the notes and lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement as to the appropriate manner of pursuing enforcement remedies with respect to the Collateral. In such an event, the holders of the notes will be bound by any decisions of the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement, which may result in enforcement actions against the Collateral that are not approved by the holders of the notes or that may be adverse to you. The effective control of the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement may delay enforcement against the Collateral. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Deed.” Further, the security interests in the Collateral that will constitute security for the obligations of the Issuer under the notes and the Indenture will not be granted directly to the holders of the notes but only in favor of the Security Trustee, as beneficiary of parallel debt obligations (the “Parallel Debt”). This Parallel Debt is created to satisfy a requirement under the laws of Belgium and Germany that the Security Trustee, as grantee of certain types of Collateral, be a creditor of the relevant security provider. The Parallel Debt is in the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture and the notes (the “Principal Obligations”). Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Although the Security Trustee will have, pursuant to the Parallel Debt, a claim against the Issuer for the full principal amount of the notes, holders of the notes bear some risks associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Trustee. There is no assurance that such a structure will be effective before courts in the governing law jurisdictions of the security documents as there is no judicial or other guidance as to its efficacy, and therefore the ability of the Security Trustee to enforce the Collateral may be restricted.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

See “Description of the Notes—Security—Enforcement of Security.” Under various circumstances, guarantees will be released automatically, including: - with respect to a Subsidiary Guarantor, in connection with any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of that Guarantor (including by way of merger or consolidation) to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) IGH, a Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale or other disposition complies with the requirements of the covenant set forth under the heading “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sale of Assets,” regardless of whether such requirements are otherwise applicable; - with respect to a Subsidiary Guarantor, in connection with any other sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the Capital Stock (or the shares of any holding company of such Guarantor (other than IHL or IGH)) of that Guarantor to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) IHL, IGH or a Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale or other disposition complies with the requirements of the covenant set forth under the heading “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sale of Assets,” regardless of whether such requirements are otherwise applicable; - with respect to a Subsidiary Guarantor, if IGH designates any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture; - with respect to a Subsidiary Guarantor, upon covenant defeasance as provided under the caption “Description of the Notes—Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance of the Indenture;” - upon legal defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as provided under the captions “Description of the Notes—Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance of Indenture” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge;” - so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, such Subsidiary Guarantor is unconditionally released and discharged from its liability with respect to Indebtedness in connection with which such guarantee was executed pursuant to the covenant described under the caption “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Issuances of Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries”; - as described under “Description of the Notes—Modifications and Amendments”; and - with respect to a Subsidiary Guarantor that is an Immaterial Subsidiary so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to the extent that such Subsidiary is released from certain other Indebtedness and guarantees.

Liens on collateral to be granted by the Issuer and the Closing Date Guarantors will (subject to certain limited exceptions) be granted on the Issue Date and liens on collateral to be granted by the Post-Closing Date Guarantors (as defined below) will be granted at the time such entities become Guarantors. We will agree in the Indenture to take such necessary actions so that within 30 days of the Issue Date, (i) the Post-Closing Date Guarantors become guarantors of the notes by executing and delivering to the Trustee a supplemental indenture (or supplemental indentures) in the form attached to the Indenture and (ii) certain additional collateral that is required to secure the Senior Facilities Agreement following the Issue Date (other than collateral of INEOS Manufacturing France SAS) is concurrently granted to secure the notes (the “PostClosing Collateral”).

There can be no assurance that we will be successful in procuring such additional guarantees or liens within the time period specified, the failure of which would result in an event of default under the Indenture.

It has limited assets, no subsidiaries and a limited ability to generate revenues. Upon completion of the offering of the notes, the only significant assets of the Issuer will be the Funding Loan made by it to IHL. The Issuer’s material liabilities will include the notes and the guarantee of obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the BP Creditor Liabilities and the 2016 Notes and any additional debt it may incur in the future. See “Description of the Notes” and “Description of Other Indebtedness—Senior Facilities Agreement.” As such, the Issuer will be dependent upon payments from IHL to make any payments due on the notes. If IHL fails to make scheduled payments on the Funding Loan, it is not expected that the Issuer will have any other sources of funds that would allow it to make payments on its indebtedness. In addition, IHL is a holding company that conducts no independent business operations. 39 ----- The ability of our subsidiaries to make payments to IHL to fund payments on the Funding Loan will depend upon their cash flows and earnings which, in turn, will be affected by all of the factors discussed in these “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this offering memorandum. The payment of dividends and the making, or repayment, of loans and advances to IHL by IHL’s direct subsidiaries and such payments by its indirect subsidiaries to their respective parent entity are subject to various restrictions. Existing and future debt of certain of these subsidiaries may prohibit the payment of dividends or the making, or repayment, of loans or advances to IHL or its parent entities. In addition, the ability of any of IHL’s direct or indirect subsidiaries to make certain distributions may be limited by the laws of the relevant jurisdiction in which the subsidiaries are organized or located, including financial assistance rules, corporate benefit laws and other legal restrictions which, if violated, might require the recipient to refund unlawful payments. Although the 2016 Notes Indenture limits and the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Indenture will limit the ability of IHL’s subsidiaries to enter into future consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends and make other payments to IHL, there are significant qualifications and exceptions to these limitations. We cannot assure you that arrangements with IHL’s subsidiaries and the funding permitted by the agreements governing existing and future indebtedness of IHL’s subsidiaries will provide IHL with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans to fund payments on the Funding Loan when due.

Unless a subsidiary is a Guarantor, our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the notes or to make funds available for that purpose. Accordingly, you should only rely on the guarantees of the notes to provide credit support in respect of payments of principal or interest on the notes. Our operating subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and those of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due pursuant to the notes or to make any funds available therefor, whether by dividends, loans, distributions or other payments, and do not guarantee the payment of interest on, or principal of, the notes. Generally, claims of creditors of a non-guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, and claims of any preferred stockholders of the subsidiary, will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiary over the claims of creditors of its parent entity, including claims against IHL by the Issuer under the Funding Loan and by noteholders under the guarantees. In the event of any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, reorganization, administration or other bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of any of our non-guarantor subsidiaries, the creditors of the Guarantors (including the holders of the notes) will have no right to proceed against such subsidiary’s assets and holders of their indebtedness and their trade creditors will generally be entitled to payment in full of their claims from the assets of those subsidiaries before any Guarantor, as direct or indirect shareholder, will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary.

In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in Belgium, Canada, England and Wales, France, Germany, Ireland, Jersey, Malta, Norway, Scotland, Singapore and the United States. Proceedings could also be initiated in France to enforce your rights against Collateral located in France. Such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are likely to be complex and costly for creditors and otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of your rights. Your rights under the notes, the guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to the insolvency and administrative laws of several jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that you will be able to effectively enforce your rights in such complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings. 40 ----- In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of the Guarantors’ jurisdictions of organization may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other and those of the United States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain postpetition interest and duration of the proceeding. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s law should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the notes, the guarantees and the security in those jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees and the Security Interests” with respect to certain of the jurisdictions mentioned above. Moreover, in certain jurisdictions, it is unclear whether all security interests in the Collateral give the Security Trustee a right to prevent other creditors from foreclosing on and realizing the Collateral or whether certain security interests only give the Security Trustee and the noteholders priority (according to their rank) in the distribution of any proceeds of such realization. Accordingly, the Security Trustee and the noteholders may not be able to avoid foreclosure by other creditors (including unsecured creditors) on the Collateral. The laws of certain of the jurisdictions in which the Guarantors are organized limit the ability of these subsidiaries to guarantee debt of other companies.

The Collateral may also secure additional debt to the extent permitted by the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Deed. Your rights to the Collateral would be diluted by any increase in the first-priority debt secured by the Collateral or a reduction of the Collateral securing the notes. The value of the Collateral and the amount to be received upon a sale of such Collateral will depend upon many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers. The book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. All or a portion of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Likewise, we cannot assure you that there will be a market for the sale of the Collateral, or, if such a market exists, that there will not be a substantial delay in its liquidation. In addition, the share pledges of an entity may be of no value if that entity is subject to an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding. The Collateral is located in a number of countries, and the multijurisdictional nature of any foreclosure on the Collateral may limit the realizable value of the Collateral. The Collateral will be released in connection with an enforcement sale pursuant to the Intercreditor Deed and lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement will, on the Issue Date, and so long as certain circumstances continue (as described in the risk factor entitled “Decisions regarding Collateral—Holders of the notes will not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral”), have effective control of all decisions with respect to the Collateral.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

Not all of the INEOS Group’s assets will secure 41 ----- the notes. In addition, in the future, the obligations to provide additional guarantees and grant additional security over assets, whether as a result of the acquisition or creation of future assets or subsidiaries or otherwise, is, in certain circumstances, indirectly through the Senior Facilities Agreement, subject to certain agreed security principles. To the extent that lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement are granted security, the negative pledge in the Indenture may require such security to also be granted for the benefit of holders of the notes. The agreed security principles set forth in the Senior Facilities Agreement will contain a number of limitations on the rights of the lenders to be granted security in certain circumstances. The operation of the agreed security principles may result in, among other things, the amount recoverable under any collateral provided being limited or security not being granted or perfected over a particular type or class of assets. Accordingly, the agreed security principles may affect the value of the security provided by the Issuer and the Guarantors. To the extent that the claims of the holders of the notes exceed the value of the assets securing those notes and other obligations, those claims will rank equally with the claims of the holders of all other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness ranking pari passu with the notes. As a result, if the value of the assets pledged as security for the notes is less than the value of the claims of the holders of the notes, those claims may not be satisfied in full before the claims of certain unsecured creditors are paid.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral securing the notes as well as the ability of the Security Trustee to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the first-priority ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or recharacterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions. The security interests of the Security Trustee will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral. For example, the Security Trustee may need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that the Security Trustee will be able to obtain any such consents. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Trustee may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease. In addition, our business requires a variety of national, state and local permits and licenses. The continued operation of properties that comprise part of the Collateral and which depend on the maintenance of such permits and licenses may be prohibited. Our business is subject to regulations and permitting requirements and may be adversely affected if we are unable to comply with existing regulations or requirements or changes in applicable regulations or requirements. In the event of foreclosure, the transfer of such permits and licenses may be prohibited or may require us to incur significant cost and expense. Further, we cannot assure you that the applicable governmental authorities will consent to the transfer of all such permits. If the regulatory approvals required for such transfers are not obtained or are delayed, the foreclosure may be delayed, a temporary shutdown of operations may result and the value of the Collateral may be significantly decreased.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

The liens in the Collateral securing the notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the notes if we or the Security Trustee fails or is unable to take the actions we are required to take to perfect any of these liens. In addition, applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest, such as real property, equipment subject to a certificate and certain proceeds, can only be perfected at or promptly following the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. 42 ----- The Trustee or the Security Trustee for the notes may not monitor, or we may not comply with our obligations to inform the Trustee or Security Trustee of, any future acquisition of property and rights by us, and the necessary action may not be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired property or rights. Such failure may result in the invalidity of the security interest in the Collateral or adversely affect the priority of the security interest in favor of the notes against third parties.

In order to obtain such title insurance policies, with all requisite endorsements, the title insurance company must (a) omit certain exceptions to title that may have been recorded in error or that may not constitute permitted encumbrances under the Indenture, and (b) be satisfied that no new surveys are required to be obtained. As a result, there can be no assurance as of the Issue Date that, among other things, (i) the U.S. real property encumbered by each mortgage includes all of the relevant U.S. property that it was intended to include, (ii) we own the rights to the owned properties that we purport to own in each mortgage and that our title to such owned U.S. real property is not encumbered by liens not permitted by the Indenture and (iii) no encroachments, adverse possession claims, or other restrictions exist with respect to such owned U.S. real properties which could result in a material adverse effect on the value or utility of such owned U.S. real properties. Consequently, one or more of the mortgages granted on the Issue Date may need to be amended in accordance with the mortgagee title insurance coverage in the event a discrepancy in the description of the real estate is discovered.

For example, certain Collateral was secured after the Issue Date. If the grantor of such security interest were to become subject to a bankruptcy or winding up proceeding after the Issue Date, any mortgage or security interest in Collateral delivered after the Issue Date would face a greater risk than security interests in place on the Issue Date of being avoided by the grantor or by its trustee, receiver, liquidator, administrator or similar authority, or otherwise set aside by a court, as a preference under insolvency law. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, holders of the notes would lose the benefit of the security interest.

Our obligations under the 2016 Notes and the Senior Facilities Agreement could also be accelerated upon the occurrence of a change of control. It is possible that we may not have sufficient funds at the time of a change of control to repurchase the notes or the 2016 Notes or refinance the Senior Facilities Agreement. We expect that we would require third party financing to make an offer to purchase the notes and the 2016 Notes upon a change of control. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such financing. Our failure to repurchase the notes and the 2016 Notes would be an event of default under the Indenture and the 2016 Notes Indenture, respectively and would cause a cross-default under the Senior Facilities Agreement. You should read the section titled “Description of the Notes—Purchase of the notes upon a Change of Control” for further information regarding of the change of control provisions. The change of control provisions contained in the Indenture may not protect holders of the notes in the event of highly leveraged transactions and other important corporate events, including reorganizations, restructurings or mergers that may adversely affect you, because these transactions may not involve a change in voting power or beneficial interest of the magnitude required to trigger the change of control provisions or, even if they do, may not constitute a “Change of Control” as defined in the Indenture. Except as described under “Description of the Notes—Change of Control,” the Indenture does not contain provisions that would require us to offer to repurchase or redeem the notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction. The definition of “Change of Control” in the Indenture includes a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of IHL and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole to any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of IHL and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the notes.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

These laws and defenses include those that relate to corporate benefit, fraudulent transfer or conveyance, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. See “Limitation on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests”. 44 ----- Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under fraudulent conveyance and other laws, a court could subordinate or void the guarantees and, if payment had already been made under a guarantee, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant Guarantor, if the court found that: - the relevant guarantee was incurred with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or, in certain jurisdictions, even when the recipient was simply aware that the Guarantor was insolvent when it granted the relevant guarantee; - the guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for the relevant guarantee and the Guarantor was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant guarantee; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant guarantee; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity; - the relevant guarantees were held to exceed the corporate objects of the Guarantor or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor; or - the amount paid or payable under the relevant guarantee was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law. The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon applicable governing law. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness: - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, is greater than the fair value of all its assets; - the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay the probable liability on its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they become due; or - it cannot pay its debts as they become due. If a court were to find that the issuance of the notes or a guarantee of the notes was a fraudulent conveyance or held it unenforceable for any other reason, the court could hold that the payment obligations under the notes or such guarantee are ineffective, or require the holders of the notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the notes or such guarantee. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent conveyance occurred, you may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and, if applicable, of the other Guarantors under any guarantees which have not been declared void. Additionally, any future pledge of Collateral in favor of the Security Trustee, including pursuant to security documents delivered after the date of the Indenture, might be avoidable by the pledgor (as debtor-in-possession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if the pledgor is insolvent at the time of the pledge, the pledge permits the holders of the notes to receive a greater recovery than if the pledge had not been given and a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the pledgor is commenced within 90 days following the pledge, or in certain circumstances, a longer period. In addition, under the terms of the Indenture, we will be permitted in the future to incur additional indebtedness and other obligations that may share in the liens on the Collateral securing the notes and the liens on the collateral securing our other secured debt. The granting of new security interests may require the releasing and retaking of security or otherwise create new hardening periods in certain jurisdictions. The applicable hardening period for these new security interests will run from the moment each new security interest has been granted or perfected. At each time, if the security interest granted or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. 45 -----",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

See “Limitation on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests” for a description of the insolvency laws in England and Wales, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Jersey, Malta, Norway, Scotland, Singapore and the United States, which could limit the enforceability of the guarantees and the security interests. In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, the Guarantors, any future Guarantors, if any, or any other of our subsidiaries experienced financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings.

As a result, we cannot assure you that an active trading market will actually develop for these notes. Historically, the markets for non-investment grade debt such as the notes have been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in their prices. Future trading prices for the notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. The market, if any, for the notes may be subject to similar disruptions. Any disruptions may have an adverse effect on the holders of the notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance.

After payment to the common depositary or the custodian (as the case may be), the Issuer will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest, you must rely on the procedures of DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and if you are not a participant in DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights of a holder under the Indenture.

We have leading global market positions for a majority of our key products, a strong customer base and an experienced management team. We operate 37 manufacturing sites in 9 countries throughout the world, including two refineries in Europe which are fully integrated with our colocated petrochemical facilities. As of December 31, 2009, our total chemical production capacity was approximately 24,000 kilotonnes per year, of which 71% was in Europe and 29% was in North America. Our refineries have a combined crude oil distillation capacity of more than 410,000 barrels per day. We operate our business through four segments: Refining, Olefins & Polymers Europe, Olefins & Polymers North America and Chemical Intermediates. The products we manufacture are derived from crude oil and natural gas, and include refined products, olefins, polymers and various petrochemical products directly or indirectly derived from olefins. Our products serve a broad and diverse range of end markets, including transport and heating fuels, packaging, construction, automotive, white goods/durables, agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals. Our highly integrated production facilities allow us to process raw materials into higher value-added products. We own five sites integrated with crackers and polymer units, of which two are integrated with our refineries. Typically, these account for approximately 80% of our olefin and polymer volumes and 100% of our refining volumes. In Europe, approximately 80%, of our ethylene and propylene output is typically sold internally. Our four European polyolefins sites receive more than 95% of their feedstock supply from our integrated crackers. Similarly, in the United States, much of our olefin feedstock requirements for our polymer business is supplied by either our Chocolate Bayou cracker in Texas, or by integrated third-party crackers, such as the BP Carson facility in California. We believe that with our highly integrated facilities we are able to capture attractive margins across the value chain, enjoy greater certainty of feedstock supply, reduce logistical costs, improve energy management and optimize our product slate. We benefit from the cost advantages of operating large-scale, well-invested, highly integrated facilities strategically located near major transportation facilities and customer locations. Since January 1, 2001, we and our predecessors have invested more than €1.5 billion in our production facilities to ensure that they operate efficiently, resulting in integrated, state-of-the-art production units. We believe this allows us to operate at lower cost and higher utilization rates than most of our competitors, and enables us to maintain positive margin and cash flows even during downturns in industry cycles or customer demand. For the year ended December 31, 2009, our revenue was €18.1 billion and our EBITDA before exceptionals was €1.2 billion. Over the past several years, we have implemented a range of strategic initiatives designed to lower our operating costs, increase our profitability and further enhance our market position. These include fixed asset investments to expand our capacity in higher value products, enhance productivity at our existing facilities and significantly reduce our fixed cost structure through head count reductions, production line closures and system upgrades. Between 2006 and 2009, fixed costs were reduced by approximately € 450 million. We have shifted our product portfolio to focus on more differentiated products, exited low-margin businesses and implemented premium pricing strategies designed to improve our margins. We believe these initiatives provide us with a strong platform to 58 ----- drive growth, create significant operating leverage and position us to benefit from eventual volume recovery in our end markets. Since April 1998, when INEOS was established with the acquisition of the Belgian “Oxide” assets from Inspec plc, we have significantly expanded, both through a series of strategic acquisitions of businesses and assets from major chemical companies, and through organic growth. The combination of INEOS and Innovene in December 2005 represented a transformational acquisition for our company, providing global scale and further upstream integration. During 2007, we acquired the Borealis petrochemical manufacturing business in Norway. In 2008, we acquired the former BP vinyl acetate monomer/ethyl acetate business in Hull, UK and the former BASF acrylonitrile business in Seal Sands, UK. In 2009, we transferred certain companies and businesses out of the INEOS Group to INEOS Industries Holdings Ltd. These businesses had consumed a significant amount of cash in the prior three years and were forecast to continue to be a significant drain on cash resources (due to either difficult trading conditions or requiring significant investment over the next two to three years). The transferred businesses comprised the ABS, Styrenics, Melamines, Healthcare, Bio and Films Italia Srl businesses, together with our shareholding in the INEOS Nova JV. In 2010, we sold our businesses associated with the production of chlor-akali and PVC and our business associated with fluorochemicals.

1224_1,Offerings 2010.md,1152,OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS,1152.1,Overview,1152.1.2,Key Factors Affecting Our Businesses,"Our results of operations are driven by a combination of factors affecting the refining, petrochemical and chemical intermediate markets generally, including general economic conditions, prices of raw materials, global supply and demand for our products and environmental legislation and climate change initiatives. Our results of operations are also impacted by company-specific structural and operational factors. Set forth below is an overview of the key drivers that have affected the historical results of operations, and are expected to affect our future results of operations. _Supply and Demand in the Petrochemical Industry_ Margins in the petrochemical industry are strongly influenced by industry utilization. As demand for petrochemical products approaches available supply, utilization rates rise, and, prices and margins typically increase. Historically, this relationship has been highly cyclical due to fluctuations in supply resulting from the timing of new investments in capacity and general economic conditions affecting the relative strength or weakness of demand. Generally, capacity is more likely to be added in periods when current or expected future demand is strong and margins are, or are expected to be, high. Investments in new capacity can result, and in the past frequently have resulted, in over-capacity, which typically leads to a reduction of margins. In response, petrochemical producers typically reduce capacity or limit further capacity additions, eventually causing the market to be relatively undersupplied. The bottom of the last cycle was reached in 2001 and continued through 2002 due to weak demand and substantial capacity additions. Since 2003, stronger demand and limited capacity investments led to improved utilization rates and rising contribution margins until their peak in 2007. The global economic downturn in 2008 contributed to significant decreases in volumes and margins for olefins and polymers in the fourth quarter of that year. Industry experts expect current market conditions in the petrochemical sector to continue over the short term. According to CMAI, weak demand outlook and continued over-supply are forecast to keep industry margins weak until 2012. CMAI expects the next peak to be in the period 2015 to 2017. Factors leading to this peak are supply and demand tightness, as demand growth is forecasted to have recovered by then, and a lack of further investments in key regions. As with refining margins, the actual pace of the recovery in margins for olefins and polymers will be heavily dependent on the pace of recovery in end-user product demand. Cycle periods in the industry are typically between 6 to 8 years. In addition to the global petrochemical cycle, margins are also susceptible to potentially significant swings in the short term. This volatility, which may be global or isolated in individual regions, can be caused by a number of factors, including fluctuations in utilization rates due to planned or unplanned plant outages, political and economic conditions driving rapid changes in prices for key feedstocks, exchange rate fluctuations and changes in 59 ----- inventory management policies by petrochemical customers (such as inventory building or de-stocking in periods of expected price increases). _Supply and Demand in the European Refining Industry_ The refinery industry in Europe historically has been characterized by steady growth in demand for refinery products, cyclical margins due to periodic over-capacity and supply shortages in various regional markets, and seasonal fluctuations in the consumption of particular types of refinery products, such as higher gasoline consumption during the summer driving season, and higher home heating oil consumption during the winter months. In aggregate, refining industry margins have experienced a sharp upturn since 2002, with the 2004-2008 period returning strong growth. This was the result of rapidly increasing world demand coupled with a loss of complex refinery capacity in the US as a result of hurricane damage, leading to increasing utilisation of the available refining capacity. Refining capacity additions were not sufficient to keep pace with the demand in general, and this especially applied to the middle distillate products (for example, diesel, jet fuel, gasoil), where growth was substantial. In late 2008, demand dropped as a result of the deterioration in the global economy. For much of 2009, margins have languished at bottom of cycle levels, as the system adjusted to the prevailing demand level. In the short term, signs of recovery in demand are starting to emerge in all regions, and in particular in the Far East. Industry experts expect a gradual recovery over the next few years in the refining sector. The actual pace of the recovery in margins is heavily dependent on the pace of recovery in end-user product demand. Even given planned capacity additions, middle distillate capacity could come under pressure if the recovery in demand emerges more quickly than forecast, resulting in higher margins in the near term. _Asset Utilization_ Our results of operations are materially influenced by the degree to which we utilize our assets in order to achieve maximum production volumes. As a low-cost producer, we believe in operating our facilities at full capacity. We believe this allows us to maintain positive margins and cash flows, even during downturns in industry cycles or customer demand, more readily than some of our competitors who have higher production costs. We intend to achieve growth in production volume by improving utilization rates within the defined availability of an asset, improving availability of an asset by minimizing planned and unplanned facility downtime and improving capacity of an asset through de-bottlenecking projects. For example, the number and length of turnarounds (scheduled outages of a unit in order to perform necessary inspections and testing to comply with industry regulations and to permit us to carry out any maintenance activities that may be necessary) carried out in any given period can impact operating results. When possible, we seek to schedule the timing of turnarounds to coincide with periods of relatively low demand for the products of the relevant units. Olefins crackers typically undergo major turnarounds every four or five years, with each turnaround lasting four to six weeks. Similarly, refineries typically undergo major turnarounds lasting several weeks every four or five years. Turnarounds for polymers and derivatives units are more frequent, typically every one to two years, but generally last only seven to 10 days. Likewise, unplanned outages, such as the fire at the Chocolate Bayou facility in August 2005 or the impact of Hurricane Ike in Autumn 2008, can impact our operating results, even if such outages are covered by insurance. Similarly, planned or unplanned outages of our competitors can positively affect our operating results by decreasing the supply of product in the market. _Oil and Gas Price Movements_ Feedstock costs are a significant component of the operating costs of our petrochemical business. The costs of the feedstocks we require to make our petrochemical products (naphtha, ethane, butane and propane) are principally driven by the price of oil and natural gas. According to the U.S. Energy Administration, the spot price for Brent crude oil increased from approximately $19.42 per barrel in January 2002 to approximately $74.46 per barrel in December 2009, while the U.S. natural gas wellhead price increased from $2.50 per thousand cubic feet in January 2002 to $4.44 per thousand cubic feet in December 2009. During 2008 there was a significant level of volatility in crude oil prices and thus petrochemical products, with crude oil prices reaching their peak of $147 per barrel in July 2008 before decreasing sharply to $41 per barrel by the end of the year. They then rose again to approximately $75 per barrel by the end of December 2009. The increase in our revenue, peaking in 2008, reflects 60 ----- the fact that in the recent past we have been able to pass on increases in feedstock prices to our customers in the form of higher product prices. The reduction in revenue for 2009 is largely the converse effect as crude prices have been much lower than one year ago. Our ability to pass on price increases for crude oil is limited due to the impact of time lags resulting from the repricing intervals of our contracts with suppliers and customers, particularly in the petrochemical business. While most of our feedstock contracts reprice daily, our contracts with petrochemical customers generally reprice on a monthly basis. A further limitation is that many of our customers take advantage of fluctuating prices by building inventories when they expect product prices to increase and reducing inventories when they expect prices to decrease. The effect of these time lags and our customers’ inventory management policies on our ability to pass through feedstock price increases is magnified in periods of high volatility. In addition, changes in oil and gas prices have a direct impact on our working capital levels. In general, increases in feedstock prices lead to an increase in our working capital and decreases in feedstock prices lead to a decrease in our working capital. _Implementation of Cost Reduction_ We have historically focused on implementing our strategies of reducing costs by making rapid reductions in underlying fixed costs and implementing an efficient corporate and management structure and maximizing the utilization of our assets. Our ability to continue to reduce costs will impact, among other things, our profitability and capacity plans. _Debt Structure_ As of December 31, 2009, we had €7,788.8 million (2008: €8,139.6 million) of indebtedness. Our future results of operations, and in particular our net finance charges, will be significantly affected by the amount of indebtedness, including the interest we pay on our indebtedness. The servicing of this indebtedness will impact, among other things, our cash flows and our cash balance. _Foreign Exchange Rate Fluctuations_ Our results of operations may be affected by both the transaction effects and translation effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. A substantial portion of our revenue is generated in, or linked to, the U.S. dollar and euro. In our refining business, the prices of finished products and of the underlying raw materials are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, while our costs are largely denominated in euro and British pounds. In our European petrochemical business, product prices, certain feedstock costs and most other costs are denominated in euro and British pounds. In our U.S. petrochemical and chemical intermediates businesses, product prices, raw material costs and most other costs are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. We generally do not enter into foreign currency exchange instruments to hedge our foreign currency exposure, although we have done so in the past and we may do so in the future. We also believe that we benefit from natural hedging to the extent that we have been able to match the currencies of our cash flows and long-term indebtedness. Our reporting currency is the euro, and our results of operations will be impacted by the relative strength of the euro against other currencies, including the U.S. dollar and the British pound. _Environmental Considerations_ Our results of operations are affected by environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to greenhouse gas emissions, and environmental risks and goals generally. We have, and will continue to, invest a significant amount of financial and technical resources in order to ensure that our facilities comply with environmental requirements. We also incur remediation and decommissioning costs in connection with our current and former production facilities, as well as other locations. Environmental considerations can also impact the markets in which we operate, including our position with respect to our competitors. For example, we believe that the cost to comply with increasingly strict environmental standards is one of the key factors that explain why no new crude oil distillation capacity is expected to be built in the European refinery market in the foreseeable future. 61 -----",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

Group revenue represents the invoiced value of products sold or services provided to third parties net of sales discounts and value added taxes. It also excludes our share of joint venture revenue. The pricing for products sold is determined by market prices (market contracts and arrangements) or is linked by a formula to published raw material prices plus an agreed additional amount (formula contracts). Services provided to third parties include administrative and operational services provided to other chemical companies with units on our sites, and services under tolling arrangements. Under tolling arrangements, customers pay for or provide raw materials to be converted in to a certain specified product, for which we charge a toll fee. - _Cost of sales._ Cost of sales includes fixed and variable production costs. Such production costs typically include the costs of raw materials, packaging, utilities, direct wages and salaries, repairs and maintenance, waste disposal and effluent treatment, consumables, attributable depreciation charges and directly attributable overheads, including wages and salaries, depreciation charges and overheads, that are attributable to production. Fixed costs included in the cost of sales are rent, depreciation, repairs and maintenance, while variable costs include raw materials, packaging, consumables and wages and salaries. - _Distribution costs. Distribution costs typically include the costs of warehousing, carriage and freight together with sales and distribution wages and salaries and depreciation on tangible fixed assets used for sales and distribution. - _Administrative expenses before exceptional items. Administrative expenses typically include indirect wages and salaries and indirect overheads. Indirect overheads would include such items as insurance costs, legal and professional fees and office supplies. Administrative expenses also include the depreciation of tangible fixed assets not directly attributable to production or sales and distribution. - _Exceptional administrative expenses. Exceptional administrative expenses are those expenses which, because of their size or nature, are disclosed to give a proper understanding of the underlying results for the period.

Revenue decreased by €10,996.0 million, or 37.8%, to €18,077.3 million for the year ended_ December 31, 2009, as compared to €29,073.3 million in 2008. The decrease in revenue is primarily attributable to lower product prices experienced across all of the business segments during the majority of 2009, which followed the decrease in the price of crude oil from an average of $97/bbl in 2008 to an average of $62/bbl in 2009. In particular, the Refining segment saw revenue decrease by €4,816.0 million in 2009 as compared to 2008. The decrease was partially offset by the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro by approximately 6% in 2009 compared to 2008. _Cost of sales before exceptional items. Cost of sales before exceptional items decreased by_ €11,432.9 million, or 40.6%, to € 16,707.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to €28,140.8 million in 2008. The decrease reflects the decline in feedstock prices the Group experienced throughout the majority of 2009, largely as a result of lower crude oil prices in 2009 as compared to 2008. This overall decrease is partially offset by the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro by approximately 6% in 2009 compared to 2008. _Exceptional cost of sales. There was no exceptional cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 as_ compared to €130.3 million for the same period in 2008. The charge in 2008 reflects the closure of the polypropylene assets in Bamble, Norway together with the planned closures of the Per and Trichloroethylene plants 64 ----- in Runcorn, England and the polypropylene assets in Battleground, Texas in early 2009. Costs incurred to date on the planned expansions of the polypropylene assets in Geel and Lillo, Belgium were also written off after these projects were shelved. An impairment charge was also taken against the HFC 125 assets in Runcorn after a review of the business was carried out. _Gross profit. Gross profit increased by €567.2 million, or 70.7%, to €1,369.4 million for the year ended_ December 31, 2009, as compared to €802.2 million in 2008. The global economic downturn at the end of 2008 continued into 2009, resulting in a challenging year with the Refining segment continuing to be impacted by weak demand leading to lower margins, particularly in middle distillates, while the chemical businesses saw slow but steady improvement as 2009 progressed. The underlying performance of the business in 2008 was significantly impacted by volatile raw material prices, demand slowdown and some exceptional events. The business experienced a number of exceptional events in 2008, the most significant of which was the shut-down of the Grangemouth facilities relating to a strike by employees, which resulted in lost contribution margins of approximately €101.0 million. A number of other events including a large fire on the ARG pipeline at Cologne and hurricane-related shutdowns in Texas resulted in a further €80.0 million reduction in gross profits. In addition, the business experienced inventory holding gains of € 237.6 million in the Refining segment in 2009 as compared to holding losses of €277.0 million in 2008. The appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro by approximately 6% in 2009 compared to 2008 positively impacted the results of our U.S. dollar reporting businesses. _Distribution costs. Distribution costs decreased by €118.2 million, or 21.7%, to €425.5 million for the year_ ended December 31, 2009, as compared to €543.7 million for the same period in 2008. The decrease was partly due to decreased freight costs and lower volumes in 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008. In addition, during 2009 the Group disposed of a number of businesses to INEOS Industries Limited, an entity held under common control by the Group’s ultimate shareholders, which resulted in lower distribution costs as compared to the previous year. _Administrative expenses before exceptional items. Administrative expenses before exceptional items_ decreased by €42.4 million, or 10.5%, to €361.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to €403.9 million for the same period in 2008. In 2009, the Group continued to benefit from the fixed cost reduction programs with further reductions experienced in both manpower and non-manpower fixed costs. Also, this decrease in fixed costs was partly attributable to the disposal of a number of businesses during 2009 which would have had a full year’s charge in the 2008 reported costs. _Exceptional administrative expenses. Exceptional administrative expenses decreased by €38.8 million, or_ 48.1%, to €41.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to €80.7 million for the same period in 2008. Restructuring costs of €29.9 million in 2009 (€20.4 million in 2008) relate to the continued restructuring program for the acquired Innovene business. The restructuring has focused on the operations at the main sites in the business at Grangemouth, Lavéra, Cologne and Chocolate Bayou. The restructuring costs largely relate to severance and early retirement costs. Other restructuring costs of €12.0 million charged in 2009 primarily related to restructuring and the provision of severance payments in the Compounds and ABS businesses. In 2008, other restructuring costs of €26.5 million were charged in relation to other acquired businesses in 2008 and primarily relate to severance costs, early retirement costs and contract termination penalties at Bamble, Norway. During 2008, the Group agreed to an out of court settlement of €33.8 million (including costs) to settle a patent case in the United States. The claim against the Group was based on the contention that Phenolchemie took the claimant’s idea of using phenol residue as a feedstock for making carbon black in the late nineties. _Exceptional administrative gain. There was no exceptional administrative gain for the year ended_ December 31, 2009, as compared to €29.0 million for the same period in 2008. The gain in 2008 related to the writeoff of negative goodwill recognized on the acquisition of Seal Sands. _Operating profit/(loss). Operating profit increased by €737.6 million, or 374.2%, to €540.5 million for the_ year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to a loss of €197.1 million for the same period in 2008. _Share of profit/(loss) of associates and jointly controlled entities before exceptional items. Share of profit_ of associates and jointly controlled entities before exceptional items increased by €77.0 million to a profit of €23.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to a loss of €53.3 million for 2008. The increase 65 ----- reflects the improved trading environment for the INEOS Nova JV in 2009 as compared to 2008. Rising feedstock prices in the first three quarters of 2008 compressed margins, and in addition, in 2008 Hurricane Ike led to lower sales and production losses in North America. INEOS Nova JV also experienced significant inventory holding losses in the last quarter of 2008 as prices fell dramatically. _Share of exceptional loss of associates and jointly controlled entities. Share of exceptional loss of_ associates and jointly controlled entities decreased by €4.5 million to nil for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to €4.5 million for 2008. INEOS Nova JV restructured some of its operations in North America in 2008 and the restructuring charges relate to the Group’s share of the asset write downs and severance costs incurred by INEOS Nova JV. _Profit/(loss) on disposal of businesses. Loss on disposal of businesses was €276.5 million for the year_ ended December 31, 2009, as compared to a profit of €143.0 million for the same period in 2008. During 2009, the Group made a number of disposals to a related party, INEOS Industries Limited. The Group received no consideration for the disposals, which included the Group’s ABS, Styrenics, Melamines and Films businesses, together with 80% of the Group’s Bio and Healthcare businesses, which resulted in an overall non-cash loss of €169.6 million. As part of the disposal agreement the Group committed to provide further support to the businesses disposed of for the purpose of working capital management of €75.0 million and therefore included this amount within the loss on disposal. In addition, the Group completed the sale of the Compounds Italia business to a third party for a nominal consideration resulting in a non-cash loss on disposal of €43.5 million. The profit in 2008 relates to the sale of the INEOS Silicas business to PQ Corporation, the specialty chemical company owned by The Carlyle Group. The business was sold for a total consideration of €304.0 million, of which €198.5 million was received in cash. _Profit/(loss) before finance costs. Profit before finance costs increased by €399.6 million to a profit of_ €287.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to a loss of €111.9 million for the same period in 2008. _Finance income before exceptional items. Finance income before exceptionals decreased by €78.8 million,_ or 45.3%, to €95.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to € 173.9 million for the same period in 2008. This decrease was partly attributable to a reduction in interest income of €29.0 million following lower cash balances and lower interest rates obtained in 2009 as compared to 2008, together with lower expected returns on defined benefit pension plan assets of €27.1 million in 2009 as compared to 2008. _Exceptional finance income. During 2009 the Group finalized the settlement of a legal claim against a third_ party. The defendant agreed to acquire 2016 Notes issued by the Group and to then transfer them to the Group by way of settlement. The total settlement value was $35 million (€ 25.1 million), and the Group received 2016 Notes with a book value of €114.1 million, resulting in a gain of €89.0 million. _Finance costs before exceptional items. Finance costs before exceptional items decreased by €82.4 million,_ or 8.7%, to € 863.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to €946.2 million for the same period in 2008. This decrease is primarily as a result of exchange losses associated with short-term intra-group funding of €12.4 million incurred in 2009, as compared to €158.0 million in 2008. Partially offsetting this is an increase in interest payable under the Group’s Existing Senior Facilities Agreement following an increase in margins as part of a package of amendments to the agreement during 2009. _Exceptional finance cost. During 2009 the Group successfully reached agreement with its senior lenders on_ a package of amendments to the Group’s Existing Facilities Agreement. The Group assessed that the package of amendments to the senior facilities agreement represented a substantial modification and resulted in the extinguishment of the existing debt. As a result, the existing debt was derecognized and the modified debt recognized at fair value. Accordingly, the Group recognized a charge of €209.2 million as an exceptional finance cost, which includes the write-off of the deferred issue costs on the existing senior facilities agreement debt and the costs associated with the July 2009 amendment. _Profit/(loss) before tax. Loss before tax decreased by €283.0 million to a loss of €601.2 million for the_ year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to a loss of €884.2 million for the same period in 2008. 66 ----- _Tax (charge)/credit. Tax increased by €325.5 million to a charge of €13.9 million for the year ended_ December 31, 2009, as compared to a credit of €311.6 million for the same period in 2008. The increase in taxation was due to improved profitability in 2009 as compared to 2008. The change in the effective tax rate is largely due to the non-deductibility of the loss on disposal of businesses made in 2009. _Profit/(loss) for the year. Loss for the year increased by € 42.5 million to a loss of €615.1 million for the_ year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to a loss of €572.6 million for the same period in 2008.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

The decrease in revenue was due to lower product prices, which followed the decrease in the crude oil price from an average of $97/bbl in 2008 to an average of $62/bbl in 2009. This decrease in price was partly offset by higher volumes in 2009 following a CDU shutdown at Lavéra and industrial action at Grangemouth, both of which occurred in 2008. _EBITDA before exceptionals. EBITDA before exceptionals in the Refining segment increased by_ €185.3 million, or 427.0%, to €228.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to €43.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. This increase primarily reflects inventory holding gains of €237.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to inventory holding losses of €277.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, although this was partially offset by the significantly lower margins in 2009 relative to 2008 as the effect of reduced demand as a result of the global economic recession impacted the business. The profitability of the business was also adversely impacted in 2008 by the industrial action at Grangemouth and an unplanned CDU outage at Lavéra.

This decrease resulted from falling feedstock and commodity material prices from the highs experienced in 2008, although some recovery in price was seen in 2009. This was partially offset by an appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro during 2009 of approximately 6%. In addition, sales volumes in 2009 were higher than 2008, reflecting recovering demand and the negative impact of hurricane-related outages during the middle of 2008. _EBITDA before exceptionals.

The increase was largely due to inventory holding gains of €53.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to losses of € 140.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Also contributing to the increase was the stronger U.S. dollar, which appreciated approximately 6% against the euro in 2009.

The decrease in revenue reflects the impact of lower sales prices as a result of lower feedstock costs in 2009, as compared to 2008, particularly in the first three quarters of 2008. Volumes were also lower for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, due to a decrease in demand as a result of the global economic downturn. The fourth quarter of 2009 saw volumes increase, compared to the fourth quarter in 2008, as markets recovered. _EBITDA before exceptionals. EBITDA before exceptionals in the O&P Europe segment increased by_ €69.4 million, or 68.4%, to € 170.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to €101.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Low feedstock prices at the beginning of 2009 were a reflection of very weak demand and low cracker margins compared with the same period in 2008. The move to monthly monomer pricing in late 2008 was maintained during 2009 and allowed monomer prices to flex more quickly as feedstock prices recovered during the year. In other key olefin markets, both butadiene and benzene markets recovered gradually during 2009 from their troughs at the end of 2008 due to key markets, such as automotive, benefiting from government-led support. The significant fall in feedstock prices in the last quarter of 2008 led to inventory holding losses of €124.0 million for the segment, which also had a significant adverse impact on the 2008 results. Following the extraordinary de-stocking by customers at the end of 2008, the polyolefins business focused on maintaining volumes, in the first half of 2009, albeit at lower margins than in the previous year, but benefiting from exports to the Far East while European volumes recovered as the year progressed. New Middle East olefin and polymer capacities which came online in 2009 had no discernible effect on our markets primarily due to healthy demand growth for polyolefins in the Far East. The 2009 results also benefited from the ongoing focus on fixed costs which reduced during the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. This reduction included the impact of the closure of the unprofitable polyolefin assets at Bamble in 2008 and in Sarralbe during 2009.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

The Chemical Intermediates businesses experienced a decline in margins due to lower volumes and demand driven by the weak economic conditions and competitive pressures during the first half of 2009; although in the second half of 2009, the segment saw significant and steady improvement in performance, with reasonable core demand and increased export opportunities returning. The significant fall in feedstock prices in the last quarter of 2008 led to inventory holding losses of €304.0 million for the segment, which had a significant adverse impact on the 2008 results. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Nitriles business saw margins improve due to increased volumes as customers started to restock from historically low inventory levels, although this was partially offset by price pressures as a result of the difficult global economic environment. The Phenol results in the prior year were impacted by the significant fall in prices in the fourth quarter of 2008, although a gradual recovery has been experienced in 2009. The Oxide results were adversely impacted by the general price decrease on the back of lower raw material prices and a changed supply/demand balance. The Oligomers business saw lower margins reflecting lower volumes due to a global reduction in demand, and increased raw material prices outpacing the ability to increase sale prices. Improved margins were experienced in the ChlorVinyls business following a fall in raw material and energy costs.

In particular, the Refining segment saw revenue increase by €2,331.2 million in 2008 as compared to 2007. This overall increase was partially offset by a significant fall in volumes and prices in the last quarter of 2008, as many customers de-stocked amidst the global economic downturn. In addition, the increase was partially offset by the continued depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro by approximately 7% in 2008 compared to 2007. _Cost of sales before exceptional items. Cost of sales before exceptional items increased by_ €2,958.1 million, or 11.7%, to € 28,140.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to €25,182.7 million in 2007. The increase reflects the increase in feedstock prices the Group experienced across most of 2008, largely as a result of higher crude oil prices in 2008 as compared to 2007. This overall increase is partially offset by the continued depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro by approximately 7% in 2008 compared to 2007. _Exceptional cost of sales. Exceptional cost of sales was € 130.3 million in the year ended December 31,_ 2008, as compared to € 45.9 million for the same period in 2007. The charge in 2008 reflects the closure of the polypropylene assets in Bamble, Norway during the year, together with the planned closures of the Per and Trichloroethylene plants in Runcorn, England and the polypropylene assets in Battleground, Texas in early 2009. Costs incurred to date on the planned expansions of the polypropylene assets in Geel and Lillo, Belgium were also written off after these projects were shelved. An impairment charge was also taken against the HFC 125 assets in Runcorn after a review of the business was carried out during the year. The charge in 2007 reflects the non-cash write-down of the North American styrenics assets at the Texas City and Joliet sites after an impairment review was carried on these businesses during the year. _Gross profit. Gross profit decreased by €1,485.0 million, or 64.9%, to €802.2 million for the year ended_ December 31, 2008, as compared to €2,287.2 million in 2007. The underlying performance of the business in 2008 was significantly impacted by volatile raw material prices, demand slowdown and some exceptional events. The increase in feedstock prices due to the exceptional rise in the crude oil price in the first half of the year led to a compression in operating margins, mainly in Europe. Price rises could not be immediately passed on to customers, largely due to the fact that input prices, namely crude and refined products, are fixed daily or weekly, but the chemical end products, mainly polymers, had monthly or quarterly price resets. The dramatic reduction in crude oil 69 ----- prices in the second half of the year had the impact of generating significant inventory holding losses. The Group experienced inventory holding losses of €845.0 million in 2008, as compared to holding gains of € 244.0 million in 2007. In the fourth quarter of 2008 there were severely weakening economic conditions and reduced overall demand across the end markets, with customers delaying or canceling purchases in anticipation of lower future prices. This led to significant short-term volume declines across most of the Group’s chemical products. The business experienced a number of exceptional events in 2008, the most significant of which was the shut-down of the Grangemouth facilities relating to a strike by employees, which resulted in lost contribution margins of approximately €101.0 million. A number of other events, including a large fire on the ARG pipeline at Cologne and hurricane-related shutdowns in Texas, resulted in a further €80.0 million reduction in gross profits. The Refining segment experienced strong margins in middle distillates such as diesel, gasoil and jet fuel throughout the year, although significant inventory holding losses impacted their results. The continued depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro by approximately 7% in 2008 compared to 2007 also adversely impacted the results of our U.S. dollar reporting businesses. _Distribution costs. Distribution costs increased by €11.3 million, or 2.1%, to €543.7 million for the year_ ended December 31, 2008, as compared to €532.4 million for the same period in 2007. The increase was partly due to increased freight costs in the first half of 2008 as compared to the same period in 2007. In addition, the increase can be partially attributed to the inclusion of the Lanxess ABS business unit, which was acquired in the third quarter of 2007, for the full year in 2008. The unit contributed €67.7 million to distribution costs during 2008. _Administrative expenses before exceptional items. Administrative expenses before exceptional items_ decreased by €58.7 million, or 12.7%, to €403.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to €462.6 million for the same period in 2007. The Group continued to benefit from the fixed cost reduction programs, with further reductions experienced in both manpower and non-manpower fixed costs in 2008. This decrease in fixed costs more than offset the additional costs incurred from the acquisitions made in 2008 and a full year’s charge in 2008 of the acquisitions made during 2007. _Exceptional administrative expenses. Exceptional administrative expenses costs increased by_ €23.8 million, or 41.8%, to €80.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to €56.9 million for the same period in 2007. Restructuring costs of €20.4m in 2008 (€43.3 million in 2007) relate to the continued restructuring program for the acquired Innovene business. The restructuring was focused on the operations at the main sites in the business at Grangemouth, Lavéra, Cologne and Chocolate Bayou. In addition, two of the production lines at the Sarralbe site were closed. The restructuring costs largely relate to severance and early retirement costs. Restructuring costs of €26.5 million in 2008 relate to other acquired businesses in the year and were primarily severance costs, early retirement costs and contract termination penalties at Bamble, Norway. During 2008, the Group agreed to an out of court settlement of €33.8 million (including costs) to settle a patent case in the United States. The claim against the Group was based on the contention that Phenolchemie took idea of using phenol residue as a feedstock for making carbon black in the late nineties. The Group closed its Films manufacturing facility in Monfalcone, Italy during 2007, incurring costs of €9.1 million. _Exceptional administrative gain. Exceptional administrative gain decreased by €77.6 million, or 72.8%, to_ €29.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to €106.6 million for the same period in 2007. The gain in 2008 related to the write-off of negative goodwill recognized on the acquisition of Seal Sands and the gain in 2007 related to the write-off of negative goodwill recognized on the acquisition of Lanxess ABS. _Operating profit/(loss). Operating profit decreased by € 1,539.0 million, or 114.7%, to a loss of_ €197.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to a profit of €1,341.9 million for the same period in 2007. _Share of profit/(loss) of associates and jointly controlled entities before exceptional items. Share of_ profit/(loss) of associates and jointly controlled entities before exceptional items decreased by €54.2 million to a loss of €53.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to a profit of €0.9 million for 2007. The decrease reflects the difficult trading environment for the INEOS Nova JV as rising feedstock in the first three quarters of 2008 compressed margins and the impact of Hurricane Ike led to lower sales and production losses in North America. INEOS Nova JV also experienced significant inventory holding losses in the last quarter of 2008 as prices fell dramatically. 70 ----- _Share of exceptional loss of associates and jointly controlled entities. Share of exceptional loss of_ associates and jointly controlled entities decreased by €44.0 million to €4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. During the year ended 31 December 2007 the INEOS Nova JV restructured a portion of its operations in North America. The restructuring related to the closure of their facilities in Montreal, Canada and Belpre, USA. In addition, the INEOS Nova JV acquired the exclusive production rights from Sterling Chemical’s Texas City, USA styrene plant and then nominated zero production volumes, so that the Sterling plant was then permanently shut down. The restructuring charges in 2007 and 2008 relate to the Group’s share of the asset write-downs and severance costs incurred by the INEOS Nova JV. _Profit/(loss) on disposal of businesses. Profit on disposal of businesses was €143.0 million for the year_ ended December 31, 2008, as compared to a loss of €29.6 million for the same period in 2007. The profit in 2008 relates to the sale of the INEOS Silicas business to PQ Corporation, the specialty chemical company owned by The Carlyle Group. The business was sold for a total consideration of €304.0 million, of which €198.5 million was received in cash. The loss on disposal in 2007 relates to the INEOS ChlorVinyls Emulsion PVC (E-PVC) business disposal, which incurred a loss of €36.3 million. The business was sold to Vinnolit GmbH & Co. KG for a total consideration of €16.6 million. The Group contributed its North American styrene and polystyrene assets at its Texas City and Joliet sites to the expanded INEOS Nova JV in October 2007, which incurred a profit on disposal of €0.3 million. In addition, 2007 includes the sale of our minority interest in Indaver NV for a profit of €6.4 million. Indaver NV is a Belgium company specializing in the treatment and disposal of chemical waste and environmental cleaning. _Profit/(loss) before finance costs. Profit/(loss) before finance costs decreased by €1,376.6 million to a loss_ of €111.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to a profit of € 1,264.7 million for the same period in 2007. _Finance income before exceptional items. Finance income before exceptional items increased by_ €44.0 million, or 33.9%, to € 173.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to €129.9 million for the same period in 2007. This increase was partly the result of exchange gains of €31.8 million incurred in 2008, as compared to no exchange gains in 2007. _Finance costs before exceptional items. Finance costs before exceptional items increased by €75.3 million,_ or 8.6%, to € 946.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to €870.9 million for the same period in 2007. This increase was primarily the result of exchange losses associated with short-term intra-group funding of €158.0 million incurred in 2008, as compared to €79.1 million in 2007. _Profit/(loss) before tax. Profit/(loss) before tax decreased by €1,407.9 million to a loss of €884.2 million_ for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to a profit of €523.7 million for the same period in 2007. _Tax (charge)/credit. Tax decreased by €432.8 million to a credit of €311.6 million for the year ended_ December 31, 2008, as compared to a charge of €121.2 million for the same period in 2007. The decrease in taxation was due to the large taxable losses incurred by the Group in 2008 and a decrease in the UK corporation tax rate from 30% in 2007 to 28% in 2008. _Profit/(loss) for the year. Profit/(loss) for the year decreased by €975.1 million to a loss of €572.6 million_ for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to a profit of €402.5 million for the same period in 2007.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

Revenue in the Refining segment increased by € 2,331.2 million, or 24.7%, to €11,757.7 million_ for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to €9,426.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in revenue was due to higher product prices, which followed the increase in the crude oil price from an average of $73/bbl in 2007 to an average of $97/bbl in 2008. This increase in price was partly offset by lower volumes following a CDU shutdown at Lavéra and the industrial action at Grangemouth. _EBITDA before exceptionals. EBITDA before exceptionals in the Refining segment decreased by_ €384.0 million, or 89.8%, to €43.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to € 427.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. This decrease primarily reflects inventory holding losses of €277.0 million in the year ended December 31 2008, compared to inventory holding gains of € 149.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The results in 2008 were also negatively impacted by the industrial action at Grangemouth and one off operational issues with the crude distillation unit at Lavéra. These losses were partly offset by improved margins in 2008 as compared to 2007. Margins improved as a result of the underlying tightness in global refining capacity and as a result of a number of unplanned competitor refinery outages during the year. The continued depreciation of the U.S. dollar compared to the euro during 2008 of approximately 7% also adversely impacted the results of the segment.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

Revenue in the O&P North America segment decreased by €85.9 million, or 2.8%, to_ €2,950.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to €3,036.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. This decrease was partially a result of the depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro during 2008 of approximately 7% since the underlying U.S. dollar revenues increased as compared to 2007. The increase in U.S. dollar revenues was largely the result of a 20% increase in full year average sales prices, offset by a 14% decrease in sale volumes against 2007. The lower sales volumes were due primarily to hurricane-related outages during the middle of 2008, the shutdown of the polypropylene #2 unit at the Chocolate Bayou facility, at the end of 2007 and the early 2008 planned turnaround outage at the Carson polypropylene facility. In addition, the U.S. economic market conditions in the last quarter of 2008 were particularly weak, which negatively impacted volumes. _EBITDA before exceptionals. EBITDA before exceptionals in the O&P North America segment decreased_ by €215.8 million, or 89.2%, to € 26.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to € 72 ----- 242.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was largely due to inventory holding losses of €140.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to inventory holding gains of €81.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Also contributing to the decrease was the weaker U.S. dollar, which depreciated approximately 7% against the euro in 2008. This decrease was partially offset by lower fixed costs, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2008, as the business focused on cutting costs in response to the deteriorating U.S. economic conditions.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

The increase in revenues reflects the impact of higher sales prices as a result of higher feedstock costs in the first three quarters of 2008, as compared to 2007. Volumes were also higher in this period compared to 2007, helped by the acquisition of the Borealis AS business, which occurred in the third quarter of 2007 and two cracker outages in Grangemouth in the third quarter of 2007, following a prolonged turnaround on the naphtha cracker and technical problems on the gas cracker. In contrast, the fourth quarter of 2008 saw volumes drop dramatically as customers started de-stocking amidst the global economic downturn. _EBITDA before exceptionals. EBITDA before exceptionals in the O&P Europe segment decreased by_ €424.8 million, or 80.7%, to € 101.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to €526.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Rising feedstock prices at the beginning of 2008 led to cracker margins halving as compared to 2007, as the rising prices compressed margins while product prices were fixed under the quarterly pricing mechanism. Cracker feedstock prices fell rapidly from the middle of the third quarter of 2008, and this had the effect of reversing the margin trend. However, this was accompanied by a sharp decline in product demand driven by the global recession, so the business was unable to take advantage of the record margins. In the first half of 2008 the polyolefins business ran at full rates, pushing polymer prices well ahead of rising feedstock prices, although margins were still below those achieved in 2007. As crude oil prices started to fall in the second half of 2008, polyolefin customers started to de-stock extraordinarily heavily, resulting in a highly diminished sales throughput in the last quarter of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007. The dramatic fall in feedstock prices led to inventory holding losses of €124.0 million during 2008, as compared to holding gains of €17.0 million in 2007. The 2008 results were also impacted by a fire on the ARG pipeline at our Cologne site and industrial action at our Grangemouth site.

During the first three quarters of 2008, the segment increased in revenue as compared to the same period in 2007 due to the rising feedstock prices, which led to higher sales prices of finished goods. However, the fourth quarter of 2008 saw volumes and prices fall dramatically following significant customer de-stocking as the global economic recession impacted demand. _EBITDA before exceptionals. EBITDA before exceptionals in the Chemical Intermediates segment_ decreased by €602.7 million, or 58.8%, to € 422.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to €1025.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The overall decrease reflects the challenging market conditions in 2008, as high feedstock prices compressed margins across most businesses and a significant volume reduction occurred in the last quarter of 2008 following a sharp decline in demand. The significant fall in feedstock prices in the last quarter of 2008 led to inventory holding losses of €304.0 million, as compared to no losses in 2007. Nitriles margins were compressed during 2008 as raw material price increases outpaced the ability to increase prices, resulting in weaker margins than in 2007. In addition, the dramatic fall in the raw material prices in the final quarter of 2008 led to significant inventory losses for the business. The Oligomers results in 2008 were impacted by weaker margins than in 2007, as raw material prices increased throughout most of 2008 at a greater pace than selling prices. In addition the Oligomers performance in 2008 was impacted by two major plant turnarounds and the aftermath of the hurricane in the Gulf. Lower PVC margins in 2008 as compared to 2007 impacted the results of the 73 ----- ChlorVinyls business as rising raw material costs and energy prices resulted in weaker margins. The Phenol business also experienced significant inventory losses in 2008, as raw material prices fell significantly in the final quarter of 2008, in addition to a significant fall in demand and margin erosion. The Oxide business saw improved results in 2008 as compared to 2007 due to an exceptionally strong first half of the year, which more than offset the impact of the general economic downturn in the fourth quarter of 2008, as volumes fell dramatically due to widespread destocking. The overall decrease in EBITDA for the segment was partially offset by a decrease in fixed costs, as the Group focused on reducing fixed cost levels further in the final quarter of 2008.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

There were working capital inflows of €796.8 million in 2008 compared to outflows of €71.7 million in 2009. The working capital inflows in 2008 were largely due to the significant decreases in raw material prices and volumes experienced across the Group in the second half of 2008 as a result of the economic downturn. During 2009 raw material prices have increased which impacted working capital levels. This increase was mitigated by the successful implementation of the Group’s working capital improvement program which reduced physical inventory levels by 31% over the course of 2009 compared to historical norms. In addition the improved profitability of the business in 2009 as compared to 2008 partially offset the impact of the working capital movements. Taxation refunds of €11.1 million were received in the year ended December 31, 2009. The net refund for the period reflects tax refunds received by the Group from the U.S. and Canadian tax authorities. The refunds largely relate to the repayment of payments on account made during 2008. 75 ----- Taxation payments of €121.7 million were made in the year ended December 31, 2008. These payments were largely due to payments in the U.S. for alternative minimum tax (“AMT”) and also U.S. prepayments against our 2008 corporate tax liabilities, together with payments for Canadian corporate taxes. _Cash flows from investing activities_ During 2009, the Group disposed of some surplus land at its Monfalcone site in Italy for €24.6 million in cash. In addition the Group disposed of the INEOS ABS, Melamines, Styrenics and Films Italia businesses, together with 80% of the Group’s Bio and Healthcare businesses to INEOS Industries Limited, a related party, for no consideration. Cash balances transferred with the businesses disposed of were €29.8 million. During 2008, the Group acquired the vinyl acetate monomer (VAM) and ethyl acetate (EtAc) businesses from BP for a cash consideration of €55.2 million (including acquisition expenses). The Group also completed the acquisition of the Lanxess ABS business in India for a total cash consideration of €49.4 million. The business was acquired with cash balances of €13.5 million. This acquisition formed part of the original Lanxess ABS deal which originally occurred in October 2007. In addition the Group completed the purchase of the Seal Sands site on Teesside, UK from BASF for a total cash consideration of €15.6 million. During 2008, the Group completed the sale of the INEOS Silicas business to PQ Corporation, the specialty chemical company owned by The Carlyle Group, for a total consideration of €304.0 million, of which € 198.5 million was received in cash. In addition, the Group received the remaining deferred consideration of €4.9 million in relation to the disposal of the E-PVC business which was made in 2007. _Cash flows from financing activities_ Interest payments of €729.5 million were made in the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to €646.7 million for 2008. These payments represent payments of interest and fees on the 2016 Notes, the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities, and the Securitization Program during the year. The increase in interest payments made during 2009 is largely due to bank waiver fees and associated advisor costs of approximately € 52.8 million in relation to the bank waiver request granted in July 2009. The Group made no dividend payments in 2008 or 2009. The Group made scheduled repayments under the Senior Facilities Agreement of €230.5 million, together with an excess cash flow repayment of €nil million in the year ended December 31, 2009 (December 31, 2008: scheduled repayments of €218.9 million, excess cash flow repayment of €164.7 million). The Group made a drawdown of € 167.9 million on the revolving credit facility during 2009 (drawdown € 410.0 million in 2008). The Group repaid €148.4 million on the Securitization Program during 2009 (repaid €348.2 million in 2008). _Net debt_ Total net debt as at December 31, 2009 was €7,126.7 million compared to €7,487.8 million for 2008. The Group held net cash balances of €662.1 million as at December 31, 2009 (December 31, 2008: €651.8 million). The Group utilized €789.1 million (including ancillary facilities) of the €797.8 million revolving credit facility as at December 31, 2009 (December 31, 2008: € 734.0 million). In accordance with the requirements of the Existing Facilities Agreement, the Group entered into a number of interest rate collars in February 2006 to hedge the interest rate exposures on €2,572.8 million of our senior debt. These instruments expired in February 2009 and no further agreements have been put in place.

We participate in the majority of these market segments, with a significant proportion of our profitability being derived from the chemical intermediates sector. In the refining industry, crude oil is refined into a number of products including naphtha, liquid petroleum gas, jet fuel, kerosene, gasoline, diesel and heating and fuel oils. A significant portion of the naphtha and liquid petroleum gas produced in the refining process is used as feedstock for the production of olefins, particularly ethylene and propylene. A significant portion of olefins are in turn used as feedstock for the manufacture of polymers and petrochemical derivatives, such as chemical intermediates. Olefins are the basic building blocks used to create a variety of petrochemical products. Petrochemicals are widely used in consumer and industrial applications ranging from plastics and packaging to construction and cosmetics. Owing to their physical properties and affordability, petrochemicals and their derivatives continue to replace more traditional materials such as metal, glass, ceramics and wood in an expanding list of end use applications. Chemical Intermediates are generally higher value-added chemical products used as key components in a wide variety of consumer and industrial products.

In general, each of a refinery’s different process units performs one of three functions: - separate through distillation the many types of hydrocarbons present in crude oil into a number of different hydrocarbon components, ranging from light to heavy; - chemically convert the separated hydrocarbons into more desirable products; and - treat the products by removing unwanted elements and compounds. Below is a general description of selected refinery units. _Distillation. Crude oils are processed in atmospheric and vacuum distillation units. Crude oil is separated_ by boiling point in the distillation units under high heat and low pressure and recovered as hydrocarbon fractions. The lowest boiling fractions, including liquefied petroleum gas and naphtha, vaporize and exit the top part of the atmospheric distillation unit. Medium boiling liquids, including jet, kerosene and gasoil, are drawn from the middle section of the distillation unit. The bottom product from the crude distillation is called atmospheric residue, which is separated further in the vacuum distillation unit. The vacuum distillation process produces lighter “vacuum gasoils,” and a heavy residue product. Vacuum residues are used for fuel oil or asphalt production. The vacuum gasoils are used as feedstocks to the crackers (conversion units), where they are converted to lighter transport fuels or components. _Conversion. The next step in the refining process is to convert some of the heavier and higher boiling_ hydrocarbon fractions into lighter transport fuels. One of the ways of accomplishing this is through “cracking”, a process that breaks, or cracks, higher boiling fractions into more valuable products, such as gasoline, distillates and gasoil. The most important conversion units are the hydrocracker units (HCK) and the fluid catalytic cracker units (FCC). Both units use catalysts to break the large and heavy vacuum gasoil or atmospheric residue molecules into lighter molecules which are more suitable for transport fuels. Hydrocrackers use vacuum gasoil feed to produce naphtha, kerosene and diesel distillates under very high pressure in the presence of hydrogen. Fluid catalytic crackers convert atmospheric residue and vacuum gasoil into liquefied petroleum gas, gasoline and distillates by applying heat in the presence of a catalyst, at relatively low pressure. Fluid catalytic crackers produce a higher percentage of gasoline, whereas hydrocrackers produce a much higher percentage of middle distillate products, including diesel. _Reforming. The catalytic reformer converts heavier naphtha fractions into high octane gasoline blendstocks_ by producing aromatics in the presence of a noble metal catalyst. The “reformate” produced is used to increase the overall octane level of the gasoline pool. This unit also produces hydrogen, which is an important feedstock required for the hydrocracker and other refinery treatment processes. _Removal of Impurities. Some of the intermediate products from the distillation and conversion processes_ are treated to remove impurities, such as sulphur, nitrogen and heavy metals. Treatment for sulphur, nitrogen and heavy metals is often accomplished in hydrotreating units by heating the intermediates under high pressure in the presence of hydrogen and catalysts. 81 -----",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

For these purposes, crude oil may be classified by its density (ranging from light to heavy) and sulphur content (ranging from low-sulphur content (“sweet”) to higher-sulphur content (“sour”)). Light, sweet crude oils are more expensive than heavy, sour crude oils because they require less treatment and produce a slate of products with a greater proportion of higher-value light products, such as gasoline, naphtha and kerosene. The heavy, sour crude oils typically sell at a discount to the lighter, sweet crude oils because they produce a greater proportion of lower-value products with simple distillation and require additional processing to produce the higher-value light products. In seeking to maximize refining margins, refiners strive to process the optimal mix, or slate, of crude oils, depending on each refinery’s conversion and treating equipment, the desired product output and the relative price of available crude oils. Crack spreads are a proxy for refining margins and refer to the margin that would be derived from the simultaneous purchase of crude oil and the sale of refined petroleum products, in each case at the then prevailing price. Actual refinery margins vary due to the actual crude oils used and products produced, transportation costs, regional differences and the timing of the purchase of the feedstock and sale of products at spot versus longer term contractual prices. It is likely that increasing worldwide supplies of heavy, sour crude oil and tightening fuel product specifications will result in continuing cost advantages for refineries with complex configurations which are able to process these heavier, sour crude oils. The upgrading capability, or complexity, of a refinery is a measure of its ability to process less expensive feedstock, such as heavier and higher-sulphur content crude oils, into lighter, value-added products, such as gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. The greater a refinery’s complexity and the more flexible its feedstock slate, the better positioned it is to take advantage of the more cost-effective crude oils, resulting in incremental cash margins.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

Middle distillates include jet fuel, kerosene, gasoil and diesel. The main uses of these refined products are outlined below: - **_Liquefied Petroleum Gases. Liquefied petroleum gas is the lightest finished product of the refining process, primarily consisting of propane and butane. Their primary uses include heating and use as a feedstock for petrochemical manufacturing processes. - **_Naphtha._** Naphtha is a light straight run hydrocarbon component. Various hydrocarbon fractions (light or heavier) are used as feedstock by the chemicals industry, for direct blending to gasoline, or as feedstock for a catalytic reformer to produce high octane gasoline. The light naphtha output of our refineries is primarily used as a petrochemical feedstock by the co-located petrochemical facilities. - **_Gasoline._** One of the more significant refinery products is motor gasoline. Various gasoline blendstocks are mixed to achieve specifications for regular and premium grades in both summer and winter gasoline formulations. - **_Middle Distillates. Over 50% of our refinery production is middle distillates. Middle distillates are jet fuel/kerosene, diesel, and gas and heating oils. Kerosene is used for cooking and space heating, lighting, solvents and for blending into diesel. With further processing, the kerosene fraction is used as jet fuel. Diesel is used for on-road vehicles, construction equipment, locomotives and stationary and marine engines. Gas oil and heating oil are used for home heating and oil-fired heating plants and boilers. - **_Fuel Oil, Residual Oil and Asphalt._** Fuel oils are heavy petroleum products that are used in commercial heating applications, and industrial and utility boilers and power generation. Many marine vessels use fuel oils or combinations of fuel oils and distillate fuels. Asphalt, a low-value residual product, is used primarily for road surfacing and to produce roofing materials. 82 ----- The most important transport fuels are gasoline and diesel. Refineries blend together various gasoline components to achieve specifications for both summer and winter formulations. Additives are often used to enhance the performance of gasoline and provide protection against oxidation and rust formation.

Please see section entitled “Business” for a more detailed description of the two refineries we operate in Europe. Over the past six years, crude oil distillation capacity in Europe has increased slightly from 16.8 million barrels per day in 2004 to 17.1 million barrels per day in 2010. According to industry consultants PGI, industry utilization rates for crude oil processing in Europe averaged 83% between 2000 and 2008. In 2009, this fell to 77% with the effects of global recession. PGI expects an average utilization rate of 75% over the next two years as only limited European primary crude oil distillation capacity is expected to be built in the foreseeable future, principally due to the high cost of entry into the European refining markets and the capital required to comply with increasingly strict environmental requirements. The lead time from the decision to build a refinery to the Refinery being operational is approximately five years, and less than 360 kilobarrels per day of crude distillation capacity are expected to come on line in Europe in the next five years (from five refineries, 1 in Poland, 2 in Greece and 2 in Spain). As has been the case over the years, some less suitable capacity is being closed so that the overall change is minor. Demand in the refining sector experiences seasonal fluctuations in the consumption of particular types of refined products, such as higher gasoline and diesel during the summer driving season in the northern hemisphere and home heating oil consumption peaking during the winter months. In addition to long-term growth trends, inventory levels are a significant short-term driver of crude prices and refined product margins. When inventory levels are low, such as at times of geopolitical uncertainty or adverse weather conditions, prices increase as the supply chain is more at risk of disruption and buyers are prepared to pay a premium for the product as a result of its lower availability. Between 2004 and 2008, the refining market experienced a period of strong growth in refining margins, as rapidly increasing world demand led to increased utilization of the available refining capacity. In late 2008, demand started to decline as a result of the deterioration in the global economy. For much of 2009, margins languished at “bottom of cycle” levels, as the system adjusted to the prevailing level of demand. We have seen signs of recovery in demand starting to emerge in all regions, and in particular in the Far East. Given assumed capacity additions and GDP recovery rates, industry experts expect a gradual recovery in the refining sector over the next few years, which industry experts also infer from the refining margins implied by the forward market. The actual pace of the recovery in margins is heavily dependent on the pace of the recovery in end-user product demand and planned capacity additions. The following chart of incremental capital recovery factor (ICRF) shows the recovery in hydrocracking advantage expected by PGI, based on their capacity and demand forecasts. ICRF is a measure of the instantaneous return on investment in an upgrading project. Note that the chart includes both cat cracking (FCC) and hydrocracking results. Since Europe is structurally short of middle distillate and long in gasoline and fuel oil, hydrocracking refineries such as those owned by INEOS are well positioned to capture incremental value over the more commonly FCC configured European refineries. 83 ----- Source: PGI PGI currently assumes the following outlooks for each refined product grade: - **_Naphtha. According to PGI, Europe will be becoming increasingly short of Naphtha between 2010 and 2014. The deficit is projected to increase from a 7.7 mtepa outlook in 2010 to an average of 9.2 mtepa in 2012-14. This results from relatively static production capacity with demand increasing. Naphtha demand is primarily driven by the petrochemical industry. According to PGI, the demand for European petrochemical products is coming under increased competitive pressure from petrochemical producers in Asia and the Middle East. As a result, European naphtha demand for petrochemicals fell by 2.1% per year on average between 2000 and 2009. Similarly, PGI’s long-term projections beyond 2014 are for naphtha demand in Europe to fall by about 0.1% per year over the forecast period to 2025. Sites that are integrated with oil refineries may see an increased advantage due to the avoidance of distribution costs and the opportunity for vertically integrated feedstock margin optimization, provided that the chemicals operations are reasonably competitive. - **_Gasoline._** According to PGI, gasoline demand has on average declined by an average of 3.0% per annum over the period 2000-2009. PGI’s forecasts suggest European gasoline demand will continue to decline by an estimated 1.4% annually on average to 2025. - **_Middle Distillates. According to PGI, demand for jet and kerosene grew very strongly during the latter half of the 1990’s (up to 9% per annum), supported by the liberalization of the aviation industry and the arrival of many low cost carriers. Robust demand growth continued into this decade (average growth rate 1995-2001 of 3.4% per annum) but the impacts of the 2001 terrorist attacks in the U.S. on international travel were keenly felt in Europe (2002 decline of 6.8% demand over 2001). According to PGI, jet fuel & kerosene demand is expected to grow at an average rate of 1.5% per year between 2010 and 2025. Much of the deregulation of the airline industry has already taken place, although consistent long-term economic growth is expected to continue to support increasing jet fuel demand. Since early 2000 Europe has become increasingly short of distillate (diesel and gasoil). In 2009, PGI showed a 39 mtepa shortfall between production and consumption. With demand rising at an average of 0.9% per annum in the period 2010 to 2015, and with indigenous production failing to keep pace, this deficit rises to around 54 mtepa (or 14% of total consumption) by 2025. According to PGI, road diesel demand is expected to continue to grow quite strongly, owing to further use of commercial diesel and an expected increase in the number of diesel cars. In contrast to road diesel, which experiences peak seasonal demand in the summer and is set for positive growth, demand for heating gasoil peaks in the winter and is expected to continue to decline due to continuing natural gas 84 ----- substitution and improving efficiency as existing users replace old systems. Overall, total European gasoil/diesel demand is projected to exceed 390 mtepa by 2025. - **_Fuel Oil, Residual Oil and Asphalt. According to PGI, overall fuel oil use has declined steadily for many years as a result of emissions restrictions, including sulphurous and nitrous emissions, and a continuing shift to cheaper and cleaner natural gas as a source of fuel, with the largest declines occurring in electricity generation and the industrial sectors (European residual demand fell on average 6.6% per annum between 2000 and 2009). However, declines in fuel oil use have been partially offset by growth in marine bunker fuel (lower quality residual fuel oil used in marine vessels) use. According to PGI, these trends are expected to continue in the forecast. The rate of decline is expected to ease, as previous substantial decreases in demand were largely attributable to restructuring in Eastern European countries. PGI show an outlook of average annual demand decline of 1.4% between 2010 and 2025.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

The key olefins manufactured by the petrochemical industry are ethylene and propylene and these olefins are in turn used to produce polyolefins and other olefin derivatives such as ethylene oxide, acrylonitrile, vinyl chloride monomer, cumene and oxo-alcohols. Butadiene, benzene and other aromatics are co-products of olefin manufacture, produced primarily from steam cracking of naphtha. Polyolefins is the term used to collectively describe polypropylene and polyethylene polymers, the world’s most widely used plastic materials.

1224_1,Offerings 2010.md,1129,INDUSTRY AND MARKET OVERVIEW,1129.3,Olefins & Polyolefins,1129.3.2,Manufacturing,"Olefins are produced primarily by the steam cracking of hydrocarbon feedstocks. In steam cracking, a gaseous or liquid hydrocarbon feed, such as naphtha, liquefied petroleum gas or ethane, is diluted with steam and briefly heated in a furnace without the presence of oxygen. Typically, the reaction temperature is very high, at around 850°C, but the reaction is only allowed to take place very briefly. In modern cracking furnaces, the reaction time is further reduced to milliseconds, resulting in gas velocities faster than the speed of sound, to improve yield. After the cracking temperature has been reached, the gas is quickly quenched to stop the reaction in a transfer line heat exchanger. The products produced in the reaction depend on the composition of the feed, the hydrocarbon-tosteam ratio and on the cracking temperature and furnace residence time. Light hydrocarbon feeds, such as ethane, liquefied petroleum gas or light naphtha, yield product streams rich in the lighter alkenes, including ethylene, propylene and butadiene. Depending on feedstock, varying levels of ethylene, propylene and other by-products are achieved. For instance, ethane produces the most ethylene but the least propylene. Naphtha produces substantially less ethylene, roughly one third on that of ethane, but produces more propylene and significantly more by-products. Heavier hydrocarbon feeds (full-range and heavy naphthas, as well as other refinery products) yield some of these products too, but also yield products rich in aromatic hydrocarbons and hydrocarbons suitable for inclusion in gasoline or fuel oil. Higher cracking temperatures (also referred to as higher levels of “severity”) favor the production of ethylene and benzene, whereas lower cracking temperatures (lower levels of “severity”) produce higher amounts of propylene, C4-hydrocarbons and liquid products. 85 ----- The following table sets forth the amount of feedstocks ethane, propane, naphtha and gasoil to produce ethylene, propylene and other by-products.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

This process is a free radical polymerization that does not require the use of a catalyst, operating at pressures above 1,000 and up to 3,500 bar and temperatures from 150° to 340° C. Originally conducted in a high pressure autoclave, current processes more commonly use a tubular reactor. This process is used to produce low-density polyethylene, characterized by long chain branching, considerable flexibility and clarity. Because of the high pressures involved, this process involves higher complexity than low pressure processes and requires expensive and specialized equipment; consequently, fewer high pressure processes have been constructed in recent years.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

In addition, it is common to add a comonomer (butene or hexene in the case of polyethylene, and ethylene in the case of polypropylene) to tailor the resultant polymer properties. - **_Solution Process._** This process operates at temperatures above the melting point of the polyolefin (above 130° C for polyethylene and above 140° C for polypropylene) and employs metallocene or Ziegler-Natta catalysts and a solvent to dissolve the growing polymer chains. This process is best suited to make high-density polyethylene (having very few chain branches, and those branches that do exist are short—only a few carbon atoms in length) and linear low-density polyethylene (having many short-chain branches, which may be contrasted to low-density polyethylene with many long-chain 86 ----- branches). Solution processes have the ability to produce narrow molecular weight distribution polyolefins. - **_Slurry (or Suspension) Process. This process is a continuous low temperature (60°-105° C, 20-35 bar for polyethylene or 60°-85° C, 35-50 bar for polypropylene) process in which polymer forms as a solid particle in the presence of a catalyst while suspended in a liquid slurry. In the case of polyethylene, the polymerization takes place in an inert liquid carrier such as isobutane. In the case of polypropylene, the polymerization takes place in liquid hexane, heptane, or even liquid propylene monomer. When propylene is utilized as the carrier liquid, the process is often referred to as “bulk slurry.” The carrier liquid serves to aid in the removal of heat as it carries the growing polymer particles through the reaction process. The catalyst may be chromium on silica (polyethylene only), Ziegler-Natta, or metallocene. The reactor may be a stirred tank or a pipe-loop reactor, in either case jacketed to aid in removal of the heat of reaction. This process is best suited to making high-density polyethylene and homopolymer polypropylene. One advantage of this process over other high-density polyethylene processes is rapid grade transitions, which makes it particularly well suited to specialty polyethylene products. - **_Gas Phase. As the name implies, polymerization occurs with the solid polymer particles produced on a heterogeneous catalyst in the gas phase. Like the slurry process, the catalyst may be chromium on silica (polyethylene only), Ziegler-Natta, or metallocene. In the reactor, the growing polyolefin particles are fluidized and cooled by the gaseous reactants and/or nitrogen, or sub-fluidized and mechanically agitated. Liquid monomer may be added and flashed to aid in the removal of heat. The reaction takes place at low temperature (80°-100° C for polyethylene and about 60°-85° C for polypropylene) and pressure (15-35 bar). A gas phase process has advantages over slurry and solution processes in that the heat of reaction is very effectively removed and operates with lower hydrocarbon inventories. In addition, high-ethylene content copolymers of polypropylene can be produced in this process. This process is best suited to make linear low-density polyethylene, high-density polyethylene and all types of polypropylene including homopolymer, random copolymer, impact copolymer and soft thermoplastic polyolefin. Post polymerization, any catalyst is deactivated, the polyolefin is freed of any solvent, unreacted monomer or liquid diluent, and the resulting polyolefin flake or crumb is combined with additives and extruded into pellets prior to sale to downstream fabricators. Several of these technologies have recently been adapted to run multiple reactions in series, yielding a product with a wider bi-modal molecular weight distribution that provides superior strength or unique characteristics such as high impact resistance.

Additionally, demand in propylene is driven by the level of demand for propylene derivatives, particularly polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, oxo-alcohols, 90 ----- cumene and acrylic acid. Growth in the demand for polypropylene has stemmed from the substitution of non-polymers (paper, wood, glass and metal, etc.), due to a relative cost advantage and superior performance.

This is due to high transportation costs. Prices are also indirectly arbitraged by the trade flows in olefin derivatives (principally polymers), the markets for which are becoming increasingly global. Polyolefins, in common with other segments of the chemicals industry are subject to cyclical supply and demand, although polyolefin demand growth has been historically strong, driven by the broadening range of end uses. CMAI forecasts global demand for both polypropylene and total polyethylene to meet or exceed 5.5% per annum between 2009 and 2014. The petrochemical industry is highly commoditized. Some polyolefins have properties enabling them to be differentiated from commodity grades and which can be classified as specialty grades. These products account for a small portion of the overall market, but carry a premium in the market and allow differentiation in the sector. The construction of a new olefin manufacturing unit takes approximately 5 years from initial design to completion. Producers are more likely to add capacity in periods when current or expected future demand is strong and margins are, or are expected to be, high. Investments in new capacity can result in over-capacity, which typically leads to a reduction of margins. In response to falling margins, producers typically reduce capacity or limit further capacity additions, eventually causing the market to be relatively undersupplied. The alternation between periods of substantial capacity addition and periods of limited capacity addition or reduction results in recognizable swings in petrochemical capacity utilization, which typically result in swings in industry margins. This long-term pattern is often referred to as the petrochemical cycle. The point in time of a given cycle with the lowest margin across a product line is referred to as the “bottom of the cycle.” The point with the highest margin is called the “peak of the cycle.” Historically, the industry’s profitability has been correlated with swings in industry capacity utilization. The petrochemical cycle is often described by reference to the ethylene cycle as ethylene is the key feedstock for many petrochemical products. According to CMAI, the bottom of the previous ethylene cycle was reached in 2001 and continued through 2003 due to weak demand and substantial capacity additions. The upturn began in 2004 and continued through until the third quarter of 2008, at which point a global economic recession led to a collapse in demand and the current down cycle. Margins are also susceptible to potentially significant swings in the short term. This volatility, which may be global or isolated in individual regions, can be caused by a number of factors, including fluctuations in utilization rates due to planned or unplanned plant outages, political and economic conditions driving rapid changes in prices for key feedstocks, exchange rate fluctuations and changes in inventory management policies by petrochemical customers (such as inventory building or de-stocking). 94 ----- The following diagram sets forth the global demand, capacity and operating rate for ethylene between 1990 and 2015. Source: CMAI After a period of favorable supply and demand dynamics lasting from 2004 to 2008, driven by robust demand from end use sectors, including growth in Asian markets and capacity expansion (which the market was able to absorb), petrochemicals markets reached an inflection point in late 2008. With the substantial slowdown in the global economy, which has impacted petrochemical demand, combined with additional capacity brought on-line in 2008 and 2009, operating rates have declined significantly from peak levels. According to CMAI, global ethylene operating rates are expected to reach a floor in 2010, with the commissioning of a number of new facilities in the Middle East and Asia, before beginning to improve thereafter, with a forecast for the next peak in the petrochemicals cycle to occur in the 2015 to 2017 time period. Since 1985, cycle periods in the industry (measured from one cyclical peak or trough to the next one) have typically been between six and eight years. Over the past 5-10 years, most new ethylene capacity added has been in either in the Middle East, which typically benefits from attractive feedstock economics, or in Asia, where producers have built assets on the ground in the highest growth market. Asia is also the key export market for new Middle Eastern capacity. While new capacity is now coming on stream in China and more will continue to follow over the next several years, China’s strong demand growth is expected to outpace supply growth such that China will remain a major importer of petrochemical products for the foreseeable future. The Middle East is attracting investment in petrochemical production capacity because of its significant reserves of low-cost gas feedstocks. The government of many Middle Eastern countries support building an export-oriented petrochemical industry that utilizes these gas reserves. While these factors have been a key driver for the large-scale development of the Middle East petrochemical market, low-cost gas allocations have become more scarce, as petrochemical projects increasingly compete with other gas uses, such as LNG or power generation. Despite a decline in global ethylene operating rates (which are typically key indicators for ethylene margins) U.S. and European ethylene margins have remained relatively high, by historical standards, in the latter part of 2009 and into 2010, though for different reasons in each region. As described above, in the U.S., the majority of capacity uses natural-gas based feedstocks. While historically natural gas has shown a strong correlation to oil prices, growth in unconventional gas resources in North America have contributed to natural gas prices remaining at relatively low levels, despite a rise in oil prices since 2009 lows. On a global basis, this has significantly improved the cost position of U.S. producers. In a market where oil-based capacity represents the marginal cost capacity in the industry (and thus sets the global pricing level, net of freight costs for international trade), margins for U.S. 95 ----- producers, have increased. In Europe, ethylene margins are currently being positively impacted by co-product credits associated with the sale of the non-ethylene outputs of the steam cracker process. As described above, since European crackers typically crack naphtha, the resulting product mixture contains a significant amount of propylene and aromatic hydrocarbons. Given the high prices in the European market for these products, the margins for European cracking of naphtha have remained at non-trough levels, despite lower global operating rates. CMAI forecasts ethylene cash cost margins in West Europe and North America to show some improvement in 2010, compared to 2009. Unless some consolidation occurs in West Europe and North America, additional global supplies are expected to lead to a weakening in margins in 2011. CMAI expects some ethylene consolidation to take place in West Europe and, to a smaller extent, in North America, which will from 2012 lead to a strong ethylene margin recovery to be expected in these markets.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

Injection-molded polypropylene includes a wide variety of end uses, such as packaging, automotive and appliances. End use segments for films and sheets include food bags, tape and wrappings for consumer goods. Polypropylene is a thermoplastic characterized by its rigidity and resistance to high temperatures, chemicals and fatigue combined with an greater density. Polypropylene has a heat distortion temperature of 140°C to 200°C, which 93 ----- makes it particularly suitable for “hot-fill” applications, which are manufactured using injection molding. As a result, polypropylene is the most significant material used in molded containers and automotive applications. Polypropylene fibers are also used in fabrics and carpets. According to CMAI, the global polypropylene market is projected to grow at 6.2% per annum through 2014. CMAI expects that the demand for polypropylene in Asia will continue to grow at higher rates than North America and Europe, primarily as a result of growth in the Chinese market.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

Integration or close proximity to raw materials is not absolutely essential but we believe it offers a strategic advantage by reducing logistics costs because large volumes of raw materials are often required. We also believe that scale is often critical to the successful manufacture of chemical intermediates because manufacturing costs per tonne produced decrease as plant size increases. Competition therefore tends to drive research and technology efforts toward developing technologies which support larger plant outputs as well as higher yields.

However, chemical intermediate products often have a global customer base. There are also far fewer competitors for each product, with technology ownership and scale of operation being key to obtaining leading market positions. When margins are insufficient to accommodate incremental freight costs to distant regions, then access to the whole global market may not be possible in some cases. The relationship between supply and demand for chemical intermediates tends to be cyclical, although to a lesser extent than for olefins and polymers and suppliers tend to have a greater ability to pass cost increases through to their customers. Margins typically increase when demand approaches available supply. This is primarily because 98 ----- product supply is driven by periods of substantial capacity additions and followed by periods in which no or limited capacity is added. In addition, product demand fluctuates with overall economic conditions. This is illustrated by the rapid improvement in demand for many chemical intermediates in the first quarter of 2010. Global capacity utilization for many products has accelerated dramatically as a result. Market volatility for chemical intermediates varies by product, with the wide range of applications for the different products providing a natural hedge for demand across the range. 99 -----",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

The growth rates for products for each region reflect the average annual growth of domestic demand in that region. 96 ----- Set forth is a description of the principal chemical intermediates we serve, their applications and their demand outlook: - **Ethylene Oxide and Derivatives.** This range includes ethylene oxide, ethylene glycol, propylene oxide and propylene glycols. Ethylene oxide is a highly hazardous product to transport. As a result, customers and end-use applications tend to be co-located or closely located to ethylene oxide production facilities. This leads to a regional market place for ethylene oxide with many opportunities for differentiation. The most common derivative of ethylene oxide is ethylene glycol. This is very safe to transport and is viewed as a commodity petrochemical. As such, the market place for ethylene glycol is global, with pricing highly influenced by supply-demand balances. Ethylene glycol is primarily used in the manufacture of polyesters and antifreeze/coolants. Propylene oxide is also a hazardous product to transport, but is moved routinely over modest distances. It is sold into a regional market with opportunities for differentiation. The major application of propylene oxide is in the manufacture of polyols followed by propylene glycol, which in turn is primarily used to produce polyesters, paints and coatings, aircraft de-icing chemicals, antifreeze and industrial coolants. Propylene glycol is a safe product to transport and trades in a commodity market place. Other ethylene oxide derivatives are manufactured by reacting ethylene oxide with bases such as glycol, ammonia and other alcohols. Ethylene oxide demand is driven by the market requirement for ethylene oxide derivatives, principally ethylene glycol. As a result of increased consumption of polyester, ethylene glycol has become the second largest application for ethylene after polyethylene. Similarly, propylene oxide demand is driven by the market requirement for propylene oxide derivatives, principally propylene glycol. Although CMAI forecast that the global demand for ethylene oxide will continue to grow over the period to 2014 (driven nearly entirely by Asian demand), there is also significant new manufacturing capacity being commissioned, especially in the Middle East. Much of this is being focused onto conversion into commodity ethylene glycol for export shipment. Combined with the impact of the recent global recession, supply is now exceeding demand. Industry operating rates have declined and according to CMAI are now projected to slowly increase again from 2011. Differentiated products are less impacted by such effects. - **_Acrylonitrile. Acrylonitrile is a well-established commodity that has been in commercial use for more than 70 years. It is used in the production of acrylic fiber, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene and styreneacrylonitrile. Acrylic fiber is used in a wide variety of consumer products, including clothing and carpets. Acrylonitrile is manufactured from propylene, ammonia and air with the use of a purposemade special catalyst. Acrylonitrile is toxic, flammable and, unless chemical stabilizers are added for storage and shipment, explosive. The building of new production plants for acrylonitrile is particularly expensive. Historically, acrylonitrile demand has been driven by demand for acrylic fiber. More recently, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and styrene-acrylonitrile polymers have taken over as the main drivers of demand for acrylonitrile. As with other petrochemicals, the growth in demand for acrylonitrile butadiene styrene and styrene-acrylonitrile polymers has been greatest in Asia while demand in North America and Europe has declined. Currently, Asia is a major net importer of acrylonitrile and derivatives, with a significant proportion of the Asian imports coming from North America. Acrylonitrile is sometimes viewed as a mature product, with global demand forecast to grow slightly more than GDP growth at 4.1% per annum. With CMAI forecasting only limited scheduled 97 ----- additional capacity coming on stream between 2009 and 2014, capacity utilization and unitary margins are thus expected to rise through the latter part of the forecast period. - **_Alpha olefins. Alpha olefins include linear alpha olefins and poly alpha olefins. Linear alpha olefins are hydrocarbons in a chain formation with physical characteristics and commercial uses that vary according to the length of the hydrocarbon chain. Ethylene is the primary feedstock for the production of linear alpha olefins, and linear alpha olefins, in turn, are important feedstocks for the manufacture of certain types of polyethylene. Linear alpha olefins have many applications in the petrochemical industry, including as surfactant intermediates, base oil for synthetic lubricants and drilling fluids. Demand for linear alpha olefins has increased substantially since they first became commercially available. Poly alpha olefins, which are made by merging several linear alpha olefins together, are primarily used as synthetic lubricants. Poly alpha olefins are value-added products as compared with linear alpha olefins, and, accordingly, command higher margins. However, poly alpha olefins account for only approximately 10% of the overall market for alpha olefins. Producers of linear alpha olefins may be divided into two groups: “full-range” producers, which manufacture entire range of linear alpha olefins and “on purpose” or “single product” producers, which specialize in those linear alpha olefins which historically have experienced the fastest growth. Demand for linear alpha olefins has experienced an increasing divergence between demand for linear alpha olefins with shorter carbon chains, which have grown more quickly, and demand for linear alpha olefins with higher carbon chains, which on average have experienced slower growth. As a result, the industry has focused on developing single product technologies to target the fastest growing linear alpha olefins. Demand for poly alpha olefins is driven by the need for higher performing lubricants offering improved fuel economy, lower emissions, improved cold start properties and longer drain intervals. According to CMAI, the annual average global growth rate for alpha olefins in the period to 2014 is 2.9%. - **_Polyisobutylene._** Polyisobutylene is a synthetic hydrocarbon polymer available in a wide variety of viscosities for use in a broad range of industrial applications, such as lubricants and fuel additives, and consumer applications, such as adhesives and sealants. - **_Phenol and acetone. Phenol and acetone are produced simultaneously from cumene in the four-stage Hock production process and are essential starting materials for a wide range of applications in the electrical/electronics, automotive, construction and household/furniture industries. In the production of downstream substances, neither phenol nor acetone may be substituted. The markets for phenol and acetone are traditionally viewed as regional because of the physical difficulty of transporting and storing phenol and the resulting high freight costs, with regional production responding mainly to regional demand. Individual regions experience independent cost bases though there are limits to inter-regional price differentials, set by freight costs. CMAI projects global phenol demand to grow on average at 4.7% per annum to 2014. Phenol margins have been recovering despite increasing benzene and energy prices and are now expected to stabilize on average through the forecast period. Global acetone demand is forecast to grow on average at 4.4% per annum over the next five years, principally driven by demand from Asia. A stable outlook through the medium term is expected to result in favorable operating rates and margins between 2010 and 2014.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

We have leading global market positions for a majority of our key products, a strong customer base and an experienced management team. We operate 37 manufacturing sites in 9 countries throughout the world, including two refineries in Europe which are fully integrated with our colocated petrochemical facilities. As of December 31, 2009, our total chemical production capacity was approximately 24,000 kilotonnes per year, of which 71% was in Europe and 29% was in North America. Our refineries have a combined crude oil distillation capacity of more than 410,000 barrels per day. We operate our business through four segments: Refining, Olefins & Polymers Europe, Olefins & Polymers North America and Chemical Intermediates. The products we manufacture are derived from crude oil and natural gas, and include refined products, olefins, polymers and various petrochemical products directly or indirectly derived from olefins. Our products serve a broad and diverse range of end markets, including transport and heating fuels, packaging, construction, automotive, white goods/durables, agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals. Our highly integrated production facilities allow us to process raw materials into higher value-added products. We own five sites integrated with crackers and polymer units, of which two are integrated with our refineries. Typically, these account for approximately 80% of our olefin and polymer volumes and 100% of our refining volumes. In Europe, approximately 80%, of our ethylene and propylene output is typically sold internally. Our four European polyolefins sites receive more than 95% of their feedstock supply from our integrated crackers. Similarly, in the United States, much of our olefin feedstock requirements for our polymer business is supplied by either our Chocolate Bayou cracker in Texas, or by integrated third-party crackers, such as the BP Carson facility in California. We believe that with our highly integrated facilities we are able to capture attractive margins across the value chain, enjoy greater certainty of feedstock supply, reduce logistical costs, improve energy management and optimize our product slate. 100 ----- The extent of our business integration from upstream to downstream for our major products is summarized as follows: We benefit from the cost advantages of operating large-scale, well-invested, highly integrated facilities strategically located near major transportation facilities and customer locations. Since January 1, 2001, we and our predecessors have invested more than €1.5 billion in our production facilities to ensure that they operate efficiently, resulting in integrated, state-of-the-art production units. We believe this allows us to operate at lower cost and higher utilization rates than most of our competitors, and enables us to maintain positive margin and cash flows even during downturns in industry cycles or customer demand. For the year ended December 31, 2009, our revenue was €18.1 billion and our EBITDA before exceptionals was €1.2 billion. Over the past several years, we have implemented a range of strategic initiatives designed to lower our operating costs, increase our profitability and further enhance our market position. These include fixed asset investments to expand our capacity in higher value products, enhance productivity at our existing facilities and significantly reduce our fixed cost structure through head count reductions, production line closures and system upgrades. Between 2006 and 2009, fixed costs were reduced by approximately € 450 million. We have shifted our product portfolio to focus on more differentiated products, exited low-margin businesses and implemented premium pricing strategies designed to improve our margins. We believe these initiatives provide us with a strong platform to drive growth, create significant operating leverage and position us to benefit from eventual volume recovery in our end markets. Since April 1998, when INEOS was established with the acquisition of the Belgian “Oxide” assets from Inspec plc, we have significantly expanded, both through a series of strategic acquisitions of businesses and assets from major chemical companies, and through organic growth. The combination of INEOS and Innovene in December 2005 represented a transformational acquisition for our company, providing global scale and further upstream integration. During 2007, we acquired the Borealis petrochemical manufacturing business in Norway. In 2008, we acquired the former BP vinyl acetate monomer/ethyl acetate business in Hull, UK and the former BASF acrylonitrile business in Seal Sands, UK. In 2009, we transferred certain companies and businesses out of the INEOS Group to INEOS Industries Holdings Ltd. These businesses had consumed a significant amount of cash in the prior three years and were forecast to continue to be a significant drain on cash resources (due to either difficult 101 ----- trading conditions or requiring significant investment over the next two to three years). The transferred businesses comprised the ABS, Styrenics, Melamines, Healthcare, Bio and Films Italia Srl businesses, together with our shareholding in the INEOS Nova JV. In 2010, we sold our businesses associated with the production of chlor-akali and PVC and our business associated with fluorochemicals.

Each has a crude oil distillation capacity of over 200,000 barrels per day and, unusually for European refineries that tend to be gasoline oriented, are configured with hydrocracking units enabling high middle distillate production from vacuum gasoil (VGO). This configuration is suited towards the anticipated high growth of European middle distillate demand and consumption relative to gasoline consumption. The Grangemouth refinery is connected by pipeline to both the Forties Pipeline System (FPS) and to the Finnart deep water terminal on the west coast of Scotland. This allows the refinery to consume freight-free Forties blend in tandem with commercially attractive crudes from the global market. The Lavéra refinery, located in the Mediterranean basin adjacent to the key crude import hub of Fos, provides it with good access to various types of crude feed, including from the Urals, the Caspian Sea, North and West Africa and the Middle East. Both refineries benefit from efficient product placement to premium local markets through road and rail, racks, local product pipelines as well as shipping terminals. Both also have deepwater shipping facilities enabling large vessel import/export capability. Both refineries are integrated with our owned and JV petrochemical assets at the Grangemouth and Lavéra sites. Coupled with our recent entry into the northern UK and French wholesale markets, the refineries now place the majority of output with inland consumers. Both of our refineries meet current EU clean fuel specifications. 102 ----- _Olefins & Polymers Europe and Olefins & Polymers North America_ In our olefins and polymers businesses, we produce olefins and a broad range of polyolefin polymers. We are among the largest producers of olefins and polymers in the world. The focus of our olefins business in Europe and North America is on ethylene and propylene, which are the two largest volume olefins globally and are key building blocks for polymers. The olefins we make are primarily used as feedstock for our polymers businesses. In addition, we sell olefins to third-party customers for a variety of industrial and consumer applications, including the manufacture of plastics, rubber and fiber. The focus of our polymers business is on polyethylene and polypropylene. We operate a total of 13 sites for olefins and polyolefins, including our large integrated olefins cracker and polyolefin facilities at Köln (Germany), Grangemouth (UK), Lavéra (France), Rafnes (Norway) and Chocolate Bayou (USA). These facilities support our highly competitive proprietary polyolefin process technologies, which are also marketed and licensed by our INEOS Technologies business in cooperation with our olefins and polymers businesses. The technologies include our cost-effective gas phase polypropylene technology, our specialized technology for high-density polyethylene and our flexible proprietary “swing” technology for both linear lowdensity and high-density polyethylene. The North American and European markets for olefins and polyolefins are quite distinct, with separate pricing structures and distribution channels. As a result, each market may experience different rates of growth and levels of return. Therefore, we operate these two businesses separately and report them as two distinct segments— INEOS Olefins & Polymers Europe and INEOS Olefins & Polymers North America. _Chemical Intermediates_ Chemical intermediates are higher-value-added chemical products used as key components in a wide variety of consumer and industrial products. In our chemical intermediates business, we utilize olefins as key raw materials. The four main product groups within our chemical intermediates business are INEOS Nitriles, INEOS Oligomers, INEOS Oxide and INEOS Phenol. The activities of INEOS Enterprises, INEOS Films and INEOS Technologies are also included within the chemical intermediates business. Together these businesses produce a wide range of products including phenol, acetone, alpha olefins, synthetic ethanol, ethylene oxide and derivatives, acrylonitrile, ammonia, nitric acid and polymer films. We manufacture chemical intermediates in 26 locations globally, with many of our plants integrated either directly with their key raw materials on site, or integrated via pipeline connection. We are the world’s leading producer of phenol, which is an essential starting material for a wide range of applications in the electrical/electronics, automotive, construction and household/furniture industries. Our main product in the nitriles sector is acrylonitrile, which is used in the production of acrylic fibers and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastic. We are also among the largest volume suppliers of linear and poly alpha olefins in the world. We are the largest producer of ethylene oxide in Western Europe and have a range of associated products including ethylene glycol, propylene oxide, propylene glycol and acetate esters. As referenced above, through INEOS Technologies, we are a leading developer and licensor of technologies to the global petrochemical industry including not only technologies for the manufacturing of polyolefins, but also those for polystyrene, nitriles, maleic anhydride, ethylene dichloride and polyvinyl chloride, and chlor-alkali.

In addition, we believe that we benefit from the fact that the refining industry cycle and petrochemical industry cycle are independent cycles. For example, during the market downturn that began in the third quarter of 2008, the refining market remained relatively stable, which helped to partially offset the impact of the significant decline in the petrochemical sector. - **_Vertically Integrated, World-Scale Producer._** We have five large-scale petrochemical sites, accounting for 55% of our total petrochemical production volumes. Each of these sites is integrated with a major cracker and/or polymers and derivatives unit, and two of these are also integrated with 104 ----- our own onsite refineries, which differentiates us from many of our competitors. Both of our refineries have crude oil distillation capacity of more than 200,000 barrels per day, which is higher than the average European refinery capacity according to PGI, and each is equipped with a hydrocracker and a fluid catalytic cracker. The crackers provide our refineries with significant flexibility in their ability to process not only low sulphur crude oils, but also heavy, sour crude oils into light, sweet middle distillates (such as road diesel, light gasoils and heavy gasoils). We operate the largest single-site ethylene oxide/ethylene glycol plant in Europe and the two largest phenol plants in Europe, one of which is the largest in the world, as well as the largest single train phenol plant in North America. We operate the largest acrylonitrile facility in the world and one of the largest high-density polyethylene complexes in North America. We believe that, as our production volumes increase, we will be able to leverage our fixed cost base and increase our profitability. Our sites are typically located near raw materials, refineries and associated pipeline infrastructure. We believe our highly integrated facilities provide us with the ability to capture margins across the value chain, enjoy certainty of feedstock supply (particularly for ethylene), reduce logistical costs, improve energy management, adjust the product slate to capture greater value (by selling olefins or, alternatively, by using them internally in the production of polymers or derivatives) and reduce our exposure to margin volatility as a result of changes in raw material prices. We operate large plants that permit us to spread fixed costs over large volumes of production, thereby reducing unit costs and enhancing profits. - **_Well-Invested, Highly Efficient Production Facilities._** Our large, well-invested plants benefit from economies of scale and favorable locations. Our acquisition activity has focused on acquiring businesses that complement our existing manufacturing facilities with well-invested physical assets from major chemical companies. In addition, each year we continue to invest in improving and expanding our facilities. Since January 1, 2001, we and our predecessors have invested more than €1.5 billion in our manufacturing assets to maximize efficiency and create integrated state-of-the-art production units. - **_Extensive Portfolio of Leading Proprietary Technologies. We are a leading developer and licensor of manufacturing technologies for our own use and for the global petrochemical industry. We use our technologies for the manufacturing of our key products, and believe that they enable us to be one of the lowest cost producers and provide us with a significant competitive advantage in terms of product quality. Our proprietary technologies, including our gas phase polyethylene, gas phase polypropylene, slurry high-density polyethylene and acrylonitrile technologies, are positioned around our key products. In addition, our technologies are widely licensed to industry participants and they are often integrated into new chemical plant design and construction. For example, we believe that our acrylonitrile technology is used in more than 90% of the world’s acrylonitrile production capacity. We believe there is significant potential for additional licensing arrangements across our portfolio. We have grown our licensing business market share in all product lines, and on the basis of 2008 and 2009 market shares, we are the leading licensor of polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinylchloride, vinyl chloride monomer, ethylene dichloride and acrylonitrile technologies. Our technology licensing contracts often lead to ongoing relationships to supply high quality catalysts and additives, and provide on-site support. INEOS engineers are deployed to provide support and collaborate with our licensees to ensure proper technology deployment and performance quality. We believe that our technology licensing business allows us to generate a stable and recurring income stream, and provides us with substantial visibility on potential capacity additions and new projects in the petrochemical industry. - **_Experienced Management Team with a Strong Track Record._** Our senior management team has been operating INEOS and our predecessors for the past 11 years and has a demonstrated track record of achieving profitable growth in the chemical industry, successfully integrating large acquisitions, dramatically reducing the fixed cost base, and deleveraging the business following such acquisitions. James A. Ratcliffe, our controlling shareholder, and the other existing shareholders, have a successful record of investing in the chemical industry.

Opportunities for profitable growth are identified and vetted in an efficient, non-bureaucratic format, which, in many cases, we believe enables us to establish a first-mover advantage. We have significant expertise in identifying, executing and integrating acquisitions. During the past 11 years, we have made 19 acquisitions, significantly growing EBITDA. We have a highly disciplined acquisition screening and evaluation process and a detailed series of metrics by which we measure the value creation prospective of potential transactions. Although we have no current plans to complete further acquisitions, as the market environment and our financial position improve, we believe that we are well-positioned to consider transactions that would be consistent with our goal to reduce leverage. We also plan to pursue growth opportunities by leveraging our portfolio of leading proprietary technologies through both our own organic operations and highly selective licensing arrangements. We view technology licensing as an effective way of establishing our products in the market and of generating additional income. In addition, we believe that the ability to offer a comprehensive technology package is a substantial advantage in attracting joint venture partners for equity investments in regions characterized by low feedstock costs and high growth, such as the Middle East, North Africa, Russia and China. Our approach to licensing varies from technology to technology to take into account the prevailing market conditions.

1224_1,Offerings 2010.md,212,BUSINESS,212.6,Our Business Strategy,212.6.2,,"In response to current challenges resulting from the current macroeconomic environment and as part of our long-term strategic aim, we have maintained and will continue to execute a strategy consisting of the following short- and long-term elements. These are designed to help us improve our capital structure, leverage our key strengths and market opportunities and ensure ongoing cash flow generation and growth: - **_Maintain World-Class Cost Positions, Generate Cost Savings and Enhance Efficiency._** We have historically succeeded in reducing costs at our acquired businesses by making rapid reductions in underlying fixed costs and implementing an efficient corporate and management structure. Continuous improvements in the efficiency of our existing sites and opportunities for site consolidation are key aspects of this strategy, as we seek to maintain upper quartile cost positions and world-scale facilities across the majority of our operations. We have achieved significant fixed cost reductions in businesses that we have acquired, delivering on average a reduction of 22% of inherited fixed costs in the fouryear period post-acquisition. As the economic downturn took effect in the third quarter of 2008, we applied a target of an additional 10% reduction in fixed costs for all of our businesses for the fourth quarter, which we achieved. In 2009, we targeted a further 10% or a €200 million reduction on fixed costs for the year, which we surpassed. Overall, fixed costs were reduced by €450 million between 2006 and 2009. The control of fixed costs will continue to be a key priority for our business. - **_Maintain World-Class Health, Safety and Environmental Excellence._** We are dedicated to continually improving our Health, Safety and Environmental (“HSE”) performance. We ensure that all employees receive appropriate training, thereby enabling them to effectively contribute to HSE performance and HSE improvement processes. It is our policy to design our processes and manufacture and distribute our products in a responsible manner so that our employees, customers, the public and the environment are protected from avoidable risks. Our strategy is to continue achieving injury and environmental compliance ratings better than world-class benchmarks. - **_Continue current measures to achieve and maintain a sustainable capital structure. - _Generate Strong Cash Flow to Reduce Leverage. We intend to continue our focus on cash flow generation by maximizing the utilization of assets, leveraging existing resources, continuously improving working capital practices and following focused capital expenditure and cost reduction plans. We will apply when possible the cash flows generated from these initiatives to help reduce our debt. - _Focus Capital Investments on Improving Returns._ Our capital expenditure plan is primarily focused on ensuring the safe and compliant status of our plants. We then focus on delivering efficiency improvement projects with attractive payback economics. Since January 1, 2001, we and our predecessors have invested more than €1.5 billion in our manufacturing assets to improve the quality and performance of our business. We believe that our technology, personnel and production facilities will allow us to continue to increase our profitability and cash flows without the need for significant additional investments. We will also continue to implement debottlenecking projects at our facilities to increase our production capacity, particularly when the incremental capacity can be achieved without significant additional fixed costs or capital expenditures. - _Deleveraging of Our Capital Structure through Selective Disposals. We have increased our focus on making selective disposals of assets and non-core businesses in order to reduce our net debt and increase liquidity. We recently sold our INEOS ChlorVinyls Business, which led to a 106 ----- reduction of net debt, the release from the associated pension liabilities, which were assumed by the acquiring entity, and increased liquidity. Additionally, the disposal of our fluorochemicals business reduced our net debt and removed a significant cash investment expense required to develop replacement products. See, “—Recent Developments” for a more detailed discussion about the disposal of these former assets. - **_Maximize Utilization of Assets. As a low-cost focused producer, we believe in operating our facilities at full capacity. We believe this allows us to maintain positive margins and cash flows, even during downturns in industry cycles or customer demand, more readily than some of our competitors who have higher production costs. We intend to achieve growth in production volume by improving utilization rates within the defined availability of an asset, improving availability of an asset by minimizing planned and unplanned facility downtime and improving capacity of an asset through debottlenecking projects. We have a strong track record of improving utilization rates of acquired assets. For example, in 2001, the newly acquired INEOS Phenol assets had a utilization rate of 85% of nameplate capacity, which we increased to 103% by 2004. Following the acquisition of Innovene, we closed three of the acquired polyolefin units with a combined capacity of 600 ktpa. Notwithstanding these closures, total capacity utilization on our remaining facilities has grown to more than offset the impact of the closed capacity. - **_Maintain a Lean Corporate Structure and Incentivize Employees. We intend to operate our business consistent with the philosophy of our shareholders and maintain a simple and decentralized, flat organizational structure that minimizes corporate bureaucracy, coupled with compensation arrangements that incentivize our employees. We believe that a simple and decentralized organizational structure is cost effective and will allow each of our management teams the freedom to use their industry knowledge to respond to market opportunities. We believe that we can increase the value of our business when our employees share in the value they create. In the past, we have granted our employees tracking shares with respect to each of our businesses and regions, with management and employee bonuses linked to the EBITDA performance and other factors of the business in which they work. - **_Where and when appropriate, and within the confines of our capital structure, to pursue long-term",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

In our upstream business, the majority of our ethylene and propylene is either used for polyolefins production or sold to other INEOS businesses as feedstock. Our butadiene, raffinate 1, benzene, toluene and gasoline blending components are sold to producers of synthetic rubber, ABS plastics, oligomers, cumene, styrene and polyurethanes and are traded on the open markets. In our downstream business, we are a leader in a number of markets that permit significant scope for product differentiation. Our linear low-density polyethylene production is primarily sold to customers in the film sector, while our low-density polyethylene products are primarily marketed to customers in the wire and cable, medical and coatings sectors. Our high-density polyethylene is targeted at premium markets such as pressure pipes, organoleptic caps and closures, organoleptic blow-molded long-life milk bottles and car fuel systems. We also produce polyethylene products for other commodity blow-molded and injection-molded applications. We believe that our competitive position in the worldwide polyethylene market is strengthened by our proprietary swing technology for the production of high-density polyethylene and linear low-density polyethylene, which allows both linear low-density polyethylene and high-density polyethylene to be produced from a single reactor, permitting the manufacture of a broad range of products. Our market focus for polypropylene is on film, rigid packaging, sheet, non-pressure pipe, caps and other technical applications. In addition, we are a leading worldwide supplier in the heat seal films market. Our olefin products—ethylene, propylene, butadiene, mixed butenes, and crude benzene—are the basic building blocks for a vast family of petrochemicals produced by our chemical manufacturing customers. A significant portion of our olefin output serves as feedstock for our polymers production, while the remaining output is sold to affiliates and third parties.

In 2009, these facilities had a total capacity of 8,800 ktes for the production of ethylene, propylene, butadiene, benzene, polyethylene and polypropylene. In Europe, we own and operate four major cracker complexes, two that are integrated with our refineries in Grangemouth, United Kingdom and Lavéra, France and two additional complexes in Köln, Germany and Rafnes, Norway. Each of these sites includes polyolefins and other olefin-derivatives units. The Norway cracker is a 50/50 joint venture with INEOS Norge AS, a subsidiary of Kerling plc. The Lavéra facility consists of a combination of units wholly owned by us and various 50/50 joint ventures with Total. Two of our olefin crackers, one in Grangemouth and the other in Rafnes are very efficient gas crackers, feeding from gas sources in the North Sea. The other olefin crackers at Grangemouth, Köln and Lavéra are naphtha crackers; each with significant gas cracking flexibility. This flexibility enables management of feedstock mix in response to changes in economic and market conditions, resulting in the maximization of margins. All of 116 ----- these crackers are either co-located with, or connected by pipeline to, polyolefins and other olefin-derivative units, enabling us to realize economies of scale, optimize the margin across a broad portfolio of olefin-derivatives, improve our facilities’ energy management and minimize logistics costs. In addition, since our Grangemouth and Lavéra sites are fully integrated with our refineries on these sites, we enjoy further hydrocarbon optimization both on the supply side and in terms of ability to capture margins across the value chain. The key strength of our operations in Europe is the high degree of upstream infrastructure integration between our crackers and their feedstock sources. In the case of Grangemouth and Lavéra, the olefins crackers are physically integrated with refineries located on the same site. This integration allows leveraging of the sites’ infrastructure, energy management and workforce. For example, each of the refineries provides the associated olefin cracker with its feedstocks including naphtha, liquefied petroleum gas, butanes and propylene and in return receives pygas, which could be a gasoline blending component, and hydrogen for use in the hydrocracking of middle distillates. Moreover, because each of these olefin crackers and the respective refineries share a single site, we incur minimal transportation costs in moving petrochemical feedstock from the refinery into the cracker complex. Grangemouth is connected with the FPS which transports crude oil to BP’s oil and gas processing complex at Kinneil, Scotland. This site separates the associated gas from the oil carried through the FPS and delivers our feedstock needs directly into our oil refinery and associated gases direct to our olefins cracker. Although the cracker complex in Köln, Germany is not co-located with a refinery, it is located in the center of one of the key industrial regions of Germany and has access by pipeline and ship to the Rotterdam area in the Netherlands, one of the world’s most competitive naphtha supply regions. It is the fourth largest cracker complex in Europe, very reliable and benefits from considerable downstream integration with a wide portfolio of olefin derivatives including three polyethylene units. Like the other cracker sites, Köln can also sell its excess ethylene and propylene to buyers in the merchant market via ethylene pipelines and its own barge jetty on the River Rhine. In particular, Köln sits at the centre of Europe’s largest ethylene pipeline network owned by Aethylen Rohrleitungs Gesellschaft mbH & Co. KG (“ARG”), a company jointly owned by us and five other European petrochemical companies. Rafnes, Lavéra and Grangemouth are also connected to dedicated ethylene liquefaction and export terminals. While our four large standalone polyethylene and polypropylene sites in Lillo, Geel, Sarralbe and Rosignano are not co-located on cracker sites, they are all located on major olefin pipelines or in the case of Rosignano, connected to its own ethylene terminal through which it imports ethylene by ship. In each case, this infrastructure provides each of these facilities with flexibility in sourcing their feedstock. Moreover, all of these sites are located in close proximity to their customers. Since acquiring Olefins & Polymers Europe, we have undertaken a significant improvement and restructuring program across our asset base to significantly enhance its long-term cost-competitiveness. In general, cost efficiencies have been substantially improved across all aspects of the business. In addition, we have undertaken the closure of the following non-differentiated laggard polyolefin units; 120ktpa HDPE unit Grangemouth, 200ktpa PP units Sarralbe, 200ktpa PP unit Geel and 145ktpa PP unit Bamble. In each case selected customers have been supported by supply from our other units. The asset base has also been added to via the acquisition of the very efficient Noretyl gas cracker at Rafnes and associated polyolefins at Bamble in Norway in 2007. The Noretyl ethylene cracker in Rafnes has been modernized and expanded to its present annual capacity of 570,000 tonnes of ethylene and approximately 105,000 tonnes of propylene. The Noretyl cracker is operated as a tolling plant for ourselves and Kerling, converting natural gas liquid feedstock to ethylene and propylene under a processing agreement, with both owners paying Noretyl a conversion fee for its services. Significant investments have been made in improving the reliability of all our sites since acquisition in 2005, such that our upstream asset reliability has improved from 91.5% in 2006 to 97% in 2009 (versus an industry average of 95%) and our downstream reliability has improved from 92.5% in 2006 to 93.9% in 2009 (versus an industry average of 92.5%). Significant investments have also been made in the asset capability, including the building of a 100ktpa swing furnace on the Köln cracker and the commencement of a feedstock flexibility upgrade of the gas cracker at Grangemouth, which once completed will enable it to crack heavier, more readily available gases from the North Sea. Capacity expansion has been implemented on our Grangemouth polypropylene unit together with the addition of ethylene co-polymer capability. The Grangemouth linear low density polyethylene unit has been converted to 117 ----- swing capability, to produce a range of linear low and high-density polyethylene. In Köln, the linear low density polyethylene unit has been converted to highly differentiated metallocene capability (a proprietary catalyst technology that permits the production of super-tough film grades). A key improvement theme of our polyolefins business has been to increase the volume of differentiated polymers produced from 25% on acquisition to 55% by the end of 2009, with plans to increase this still further in the near term. As with refineries, our manufacturing facilities are periodically shut down for scheduled turnarounds, to carry out necessary inspections and testing to comply with industry regulations and to carry out any maintenance activities that may be necessary. Olefins crackers typically undergo major turnarounds every four to five years, with each turnaround lasting four to six weeks. Polymers units are subject to more frequent maintenance shutdowns, typically one turnaround every one or two years, but each turnaround lasts only seven to ten days. A significant amount of focus in 2008 and 2009 has been placed on enhancing process safety and further improving reliability by initiating a series of process safety audits and reliability reviews to give assurance about the adequacy to which the critical safety management systems are operating and that the necessary plans are in place to drive reliability. The key assets of Olefins & Polymers North America include the following: - the Chocolate Bayou, Texas facility, one of the largest cracker installations in North America; - Battleground, Texas facility, one of the largest North American high-density polyethylene facilities and integrated with the Chocolate Bayou site through a company-owned pipeline system; 119 ----- - 50% joint venture in the world scale Horizon high-density polyethylene plant located at Chevron Phillips Cedar Bayou, Texas Site; - Carson Polypropylene Plant—integrated with the BP Refinery at Carson, California; and - Hobbs Fractionation Unit, which processes 55 kbpd of Natural Gas Liquids feedstock for our Chocolate Bayou cracker. All of the olefins crackers are either co-located with, or connected by pipeline to, polymers units, enabling them to realize economies of scale, improve their facilities’ energy management and minimize logistics costs. In North America, our olefins and polymers business comprises five sites including major facilities in Chocolate Bayou, Texas, and Battleground, Texas. In 2009, these facilities had total production volumes of approximately 3500 kilotonnes inclusive of olefins, polyethylene and polypropylene finished goods only. There was a permanent shutdown of one polypropylene unit at Chocolate Bayou in late 2007 and two polypropylene lines were closed at Battleground in early 2009. Chocolate Bayou is one of the largest cracker installations in the Gulf Coast region. The site has access to cavern storage, rail service, and approximately 350 miles of pipeline, either owned or leased by us. This allows integration to our polymer assets and our Hobbs fractionation unit, and permits the site to place its surplus ethylene and other products either directly in the local merchant market or in storage to bridge time lags between production and consumption. The scale of the Chocolate Bayou crackers should also enable the leveraging of the facility’s infrastructure and workforce. Another key strength of the facility is the crackers’ flexible design. While their main feedstock is natural gas liquid gas-based feedstock, which is obtained from various sources, including approximately 45% from our natural gas liquid fractionator near Hobbs, New Mexico, the commodity markets and BP’s refinery in Texas City, Texas, the facility also has the ability to process naphtha. This flexibility enables management of feedstock mix in response to changes in economic and market conditions. All of our polymers facilities in North America are either connected with the Chocolate Bayou crackers or are adjacent to facilities operated by BP or third parties with whom we have feedstock arrangements. Among our North American polymers units, our key facility is the site at Battleground, Texas, which hosts both polypropylene and high-density polyethylene production. Our high-density polyethylene site is the fourth largest high-density polyethylene complex in North America. Battleground is integrated with Chocolate Bayou by way of a pipeline system owned by us. Complimenting our Battleground polymers production is our Carson polypropylene unit and our 50% ownership interest in the Cedar Bayou Horizon high-density polyethylene line. The Horizon line, which is operated by Chevron Phillips, is the fourth largest single high density polyethylene line in North America. All of our polymers facilities in North America are either connected with the Chocolate Bayou crackers, or are adjacent to facilities operated by BP or third parties with whom we have feedstock arrangements.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

The use of naphthas in particular results in the production of a significant amount of coproducts such as propylene, butadiene, benzene, as well as gasoline blending components, while the use of natural gas liquids results in the production of a smaller amount of co-products, such as propylene. The majority of our naphtha requirements are sourced from our refineries in Grangemouth, United Kingdom, and Lavéra, France. BP is our single most important external supplier of naphtha and gas, via a special joint sourcing agreement. Most of the petrochemical feedstocks purchased from BP are pursuant to hydrocarbon sale and purchase agreements with varying durations. In addition, a substantial proportion of our feedstock requirements are also obtained on the commodity markets. The costs of the feedstocks required to make our products are principally driven by the price of oil and natural gas. In the current environment of relatively high oil prices, crackers located in the Middle East enjoy the advantage of access to low-cost gas feedstock. The majority of our crackers’ production is consumed as feedstock by our polymers and chemical intermediates units. INEOS is a very significant net buyer of ethylene and propylene production because our production of these olefins is significantly lower than our European consumption. To address our olefins shortage, we purchase ethylene and propylene on the merchant market through supply contracts and swaps with other petrochemical and refining companies. Although energy is generated at several of our sites, including as part of petrochemical manufacturing processes, we are a significant net purchaser of both electricity and gas. Typically we procure our requirements from local producers or utilities at local market prices. Our procurement efforts remain focused on expanding access to low cost materials, services, and equipment and creating independence from sole or limited sources of supply. We are connected via pipeline to multiple hydrocarbon suppliers at Chocolate Bayou Works and Battleground Manufacturing Complex to ensure a secure supply at reasonable costs. We, together with our North American affiliates, have centralized the purchasing of energy, natural gas, rail routes and propylene (including refinery-, chemical- and polymer- grades), providing scale, common voice in the market and, in the case of propylene, flexibility to manage our supply and demand. Our olefins and polymers business primarily uses naphtha and NGLs as the basic feedstocks for our olefins crackers. Although most external feedstock supplies of the business are available from a variety of third parties, some of our sites are substantially dependant on BP refineries. For example, our Carson Polypropylene Plant 120 ----- depends on raw materials from the BP refineries located on the same site and has no convenient access to alternative supply channels. Most of the petrochemical feedstocks purchased from BP are pursuant to hydrocarbon sale and purchase agreements of varying durations. In addition, a substantial proportion of our feedstock requirements is also obtained on the commodity markets. We manage the procurement and trading of our feedstocks internally. Our U.S. ethylene production capacity exceeds our U.S. consumption. We thus sell ethylene on the merchant market through supply contracts and swaps with other petrochemical and refining companies. Our propylene production is lower than consumption. To address this shortfall, we purchase propylene on the merchant market through supply contracts and swaps with other petrochemical and refining companies. Although energy is generated at several of our sites, including as part of petrochemical manufacturing processes, we are a significant net purchaser of both electricity and gas.

Pricing therefore changes daily, monthly or, in the case of a small proportion of butadiene sales, quarterly. A significant change to how the European market prices ethylene and propylene took place in early 2009 when the contract price system changed from quarterly to monthly, to reflect more dynamically changes in supply/demand.

1224_1,Offerings 2010.md,212,BUSINESS,212.10,"For the year ended December 31, 2009 (kilotonnes per year)",212.10.1,Manufacturing,"Our refineries are differentiated within the European population in that both combine a large hydrocracker with a fluid catalytic cracker. Of 118 European refineries listed in the February 2010 Wood Mackenzie Refinery Infrastructure report only 13 have both FCC and HCK capacity. This hydrocracking configuration results in a product slate skewed towards high-quality middle distillates (rather than gasoline), which is an advantage in Europe given the ongoing deficit of middle distillate products and surplus of gasoline in the market. This situation is unlikely to change in the medium term as the demand forecast by PGI for middle distillates in Europe is expected to grow, while the gasoline demand is expected to be static or decline. Both of our refineries are above European industry average in terms of their complexity as measured by the Nelson Complexity Index. The integration of our refineries with on site chemical assets produces substantial value in downstream chemicals processing, in the efficient use of refinery produced gas streams, and in the cost efficiencies gained. We also receive feedstock for the refinery in terms of hydrogen and high octane gasoline components. Each refinery is able to produce clean fuels meeting current EU specifications, which limit the sulphur content of motor fuels to 10 ppm. Our refineries undergo periodic “turnarounds” in order to carry out necessary inspections, testing and maintenance required to comply with industry standards and relevant regulations. The refineries tankage assets are used to stockbuild for these turnarounds thereby minimizing the requirement for expensive imports. Refinery process units typically undergo major turnarounds every four to six years, with each turnaround lasting several weeks. In addition to the routine investments periodically made at plant turnarounds, the refineries continue to make appropriate investments to deliver reliability, to meet tightening regulatory requirements, to improve yields of higher value products, and where appropriate to upgrade our infrastructure facilities. _Grangemouth_ Our Grangemouth refinery benefits from a direct connection with the FPS. Following the inclusion of the Buzzard field, the Forties blend sulphur content and density has increased markedly. Forties blend accounts for the majority of the refinery’s feedstock mix because of its freight advantage over other crude feedstocks. The balance of crude feed is sourced from the market and imported via the deepwater Finnart terminal located on the West Coast of Scotland at Loch Long. The Finnart crude jetty can accommodate very large crude carrier vessels. Transfer of crude 109 ----- to the refinery is facilitated by the 20” INEOS-owned Finnart pipeline. When economics favor such crude, the capacity of the Finnart system allows re-optimization of the refinery to predominantly imported crude. From a market perspective, Grangemouth is well-positioned, being Scotland’s only transport fuel refinery. Distribution modes from the refinery include road, rail, coaster and larger ship export via the Grangemouth docks and by 12” product pipeline to the Finnart terminal. The refinery therefore has access to the markets in Scotland, Ireland and northern England. Following entry into the wholesale market at the end of 2009 the site continues to successfully expand its access to the inland market. The refinery places a high proportion of its production inland in premium markets. In the case of middle distillate (diesel, jet fuel and gasoil) this was over 80% in 2009. Power and steam are supplied to the Grangemouth refinery by the INEOS-owned power station and a third party owned Combined Heat and Power (CHP) Plant. The CHP provides steam and electricity on a long term contract at a lower cost than traditional facilities. The INEOS-owned power station allows the flexibility to use various by-product fuels from our refining and petrochemical units to generate steam and electricity. The Grangemouth refinery experienced significant reliability problems in 2000 and 2001, prior to its acquisition by INEOS. These problems, among others, damaged the refinery’s fluid catalytic cracker and culminated in a government inspection and the imposition of fines. Significant investments were made at the Grangemouth site to address these issues. In 2004, the fluid catalytic cracker was brought back online. The reliability of the Grangemouth refinery improved from 88% in 2001 to 94% in 2002. The underlying trend in reliability (net of the strike impact) improved further in 2008/2009 to an average of 95.2%. In January 2010 reliability has been even higher at 97.9%. _Lavéra_ Our Lavéra refinery, located in the Mediterranean basin, close to the important ports of Marseille and Fos in France, has port access capable of receiving very large crude carrier vessels and uses its significant desulphurization capability and location in the Mediterranean basin to process a variable crude slate, which allows processing of value enhancing sour crudes when economics are favorable. Its ability to upgrade the heavier, sour crude grades into light, low sulphur sweet products enables it to take advantage of a wide variety of crude oils including those from the Former Soviet Union, West African and South American markets. This is especially beneficial in light of the increasing availability of crude oils from Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union. The Refinery includes crude distillation capacity and a hydrocracker, enabling significant middle distillate production. The refinery also has significant desulphurization capability of 71 kbpd, enhancing middle distillate yield, increasing the ability to process sour crudes and providing capability to partially upgrade fuel oil into lighter fuels. The refinery is integrated with co-sited INEOS-owned petrochemical operations and Naphthachimie which is an INEOS Nova JV with Total Petrochemicals, France. The Naphthachimie assets include a steam cracker that utilizes all the naphtha produced at the refinery. On the product side, Lavéra benefits from infrastructure allowing it to access premium inland markets. This includes a railway facility, road terminal and pipeline connections to the NATO, SPSE and SPMR pipelines which provide access to the French, Swiss and German markets. Access through deepwater ports also extends the refinery’s ability to export both to continental Europe and other Mediterranean markets, including the Middle East and North Africa. Lavéra has a product mix rich in middle distillates, of which Europe is currently deficit and the deficit is forecasted to increase. The refinery also has the capability to manufacture asphalt which can be sold to customers in specialty markets in France and northern Spain. This capability gives us increased flexibility in the selection of 110 ----- crude oil and in the optimization of our operations at Lavéra. Furthermore, Lavéra has access to a strong local bunker market. The reliability of the refinery at Lavéra continuously improved from 91% in 2001 and 2002 to 98% in 2007. In 2008 the reliability was slightly lower at 95.8% as a result of an unplanned shutdown of the crude distillation unit. Modifications to the heater to address the root cause have now been implemented, including physical tube replacements, changes to flow configuration, and changes to operating envelope constraints. In 2009, full year reliability was 96.7% demonstrating recovery to higher performance.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

Both of our refineries are able to process a variety of qualities of crude oil. The main variables in the selection of a particular type of crude oil are price (including freight) and quality. Heavy, high-sulphur, sour slates are lower cost than lighter, low-sulphur sweeter slates. However, because highsulphur crude oils require more processing, refineries that purchase primarily lower cost, high-sulphur crude oils require additional conversion processing capability and incur higher fixed and variable costs. Overall, average refining cash margins from heavy high-sulphur crude oil tend to be higher than average refining cash margins from lighter, sweeter slates. Following inclusion of the Buzzard field in the Forties blend from late 2006 Forties is heavier and higher in sulphur, providing a better fit for the Grangemouth asset as it contains a higher proportion of heavy feedstock for upgrading. As the Forties blend can be supplied to the refinery on a freight-free basis it often accounts for up to three-quarters of the refinery’s total feedstock requirements. The balance comprises heavier crude oils from the North Sea (including more acidic grades), Russia and Africa. When economics favor more imported than Forties blend the flexibility of the Finnart terminal and pipeline allow the refinery to swing to a predominantly imported crude slate. To maximize our flexibility to access Forties blend crude oil from any of the FPS system producers, we have completed an upgrade to our crude infrastructure linking the Grangemouth refinery to the FPS system. This included the overhaul of mothballed crude tanks, and investments in the pumping infrastructure in order to reduce our inaccessible crude stocks. At our Lavéra refinery a much heavier and more sour crude slate is processed than Grangemouth. This feed is principally sourced from Russia and the countries of the Former Soviet Union, the Middle East and North and West Africa and South America. Lavéra also has the ability to process acidic crudes, and projects are underway to further increase this capability. Given Lavéra’s location in the Mediterranean trading hub, and proximity to various industry storage terminals, Lavéra realizes substantial benefit from flexible feedstock planning and trading. Energy cost is the single largest operating expense of a refinery. The main sources of energy for our refineries are gas and fuel derived from the crude oil feedstock, supplemented by methane, electricity and steam. Our refineries and associated petrochemical units are fully integrated and use on-site steam and power generation infrastructure consisting of power stations, long-term contracts with local utility companies and, at Grangemouth, a cogeneration unit operated by a third party.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

In addition the refinery has access to a further three jetties that are shared with the co-sited chemical plants. The jetties each handle multiple products and have capacities ranging from 5 to 38k tonnes. For the Grangemouth refinery the Finnart Terminal is located on Loch Long, 10 miles north of Helensburgh on the west coast of Scotland. Finnart provides Grangemouth refinery with logistics and deep water marine facilities for import of crude oil as well as a west coast outlet for finished refinery products and components 111 ----- via competitive bulk volume into Northern Ireland and the U.S. The crude jetty can take vessels up to 2 million barrels with the product jetty can handling up to 45 kte vessels.

1224_1,Offerings 2010.md,212,BUSINESS,212.19,Business** **Key Products** **Principal Applications,212.19.2,Raw Materials and Energy,"Acrylonitrile is manufactured from propylene, ammonia and air with the use of a special catalyst. Acrylonitrile is toxic and flammable and, unless chemical stabilizers are added for storage and shipment, can undergo an explosive chemical reaction. We employ safeguards to ensure the safe handling of nitriles, including the use of specially designed railcars and pipelines for transportation to nearby customers. Ethylene is the primary feedstock for the production of the linear alpha olefins of INEOS Oligomers, being supplied in Joffre from the neighboring cost advantaged Nova facility (benefiting from the “Alberta Advantage” cost base) and in Europe by pipeline. Poly alpha olefins are made by merging several linear alpha olefins together. Isobutene is the key feedstock for Polyisobutylenes, and is supplied from within our site in Lavéra, France, from the neighboring refinery complex in Whiting or can be railed from a variety of other supply sources. INEOS Oxide’s principal raw material is ethylene. Our Antwerp complex is the largest chemical site in Europe and the largest ethylene consumer in Europe, and we benefit from this. This supply flexibility is further bolstered by access to or ownership of major ethylene deep sea terminals connected to the ARA pipeline network. We have short and medium-term contracts of one to five years that generally specify minimum and maximum volumes with several different suppliers. The cost of our key feedstock ethylene supply is based on a discount to the current Northwestern European contract price. Cumene, which is made from the combination of benzene and propylene, is INEOS Phenol’s main raw material. We acquire cumene from our suppliers pursuant to four different types of contractual arrangements. Under a toll contract, we supply the benzene and propylene required for the production of cumene to our suppliers, who then convert these inputs into cumene. For this service, we are charged a conversion fee reflecting the supplier’s costs and a margin. Under the second type of contractual arrangement, the suppliers charge us for cumene according to contractually agreed formulas based on benzene and propylene market prices and agreed yield factors. A conversion fee is added to the charge. The third type of arrangement is the toll contract, discussed above, pursuant to which customers pay for or provide raw materials to us and receive, in exchange for a toll fee, corresponding phenol and acetone outputs in fixed proportions. Finally, we also make some incidental purchases of cumene in the open market. As a result of these arrangements, we are exposed to changes in the market contract and spot rates for benzene and propylene. We believe that our use of toll contracts with customers and formula-based contracts can reduce our exposure to raw material price fluctuations. INEOS Enterprises’ key raw materials are ethylene, natural gas and acetic acid. The Ethylene is supplied by pipeline to our ethanol and vinyl acetate monomer units predominately from the INEOS Olefins and Polymer crackers in Grangemouth. Natural gas is supplied from utility companies via pipeline from the German natural gas grid to the Köln plant to manufacture Ammonia. Acetic acid is supplied from third parties, via pipeline and via imports, to our vinyl acetate monomer unit in Hull. The major raw material for our Films business is polyvinyl chloride resin, which is purchased both from the plants of the INEOS ChlorVinyls Business (now a division of Kerling), and from third parties. Additives also account for a significant proportion of raw material costs. These additives are obtained from a large number of suppliers optimizing, where possible, volume related price rebates on a group basis. 127 -----",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

Our main product in the nitriles sector is acrylonitrile. According to CMAI, measured by_ expected average annual capacity for 2009, we are the largest manufacturer of acrylonitrile in the world. The primary applications for acrylonitrile are acrylic fiber and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastics. We employ safeguards to ensure the safe handling of nitriles, including the use of specially designed railcars and pipelines for transportation to nearby customers. We believe that our competitive position in the worldwide acrylonitrile market is strengthened by our proprietary fluid bed acrylonitrile process and related catalysts. In addition, the nitriles business produces cetonitrile, oxazole, hydrogen cyanide, acetone cyanohydrin, and ammonium sulphate. Acetonitrile is currently finding increasing use as a high performance solvent in the pharmaceutical industry. _INEOS Oligomers. According to CMAI and measured by expected average annual capacity, we are the_ largest producer of poly alpha olefins worldwide and the third largest linear alpha olefins producer. As a “fullrange” linear alpha olefins producer, we manufacture a broad range of co-produced linear alpha olefins and must manage production levels consistent with our ability to utilize or sell the entire product slate. As different segments of the linear alpha olefins market tend to grow at different rates, the business has developed a variety of internal and external outlets for the key products, which allow the plants to operate with minimal constraints. Our unique technology does allow some flexibility to adjust our product slate, in order to emphasize certain linear alpha olefins products and de-emphasize others as demand fluctuates. The primary applications for linear alpha olefins are as a comonomer for polyethylene and use in detergents, lubricants and drilling fluids. Polyalpha olefins are primarily used in synthetic motor oils, transmission fluids and other demanding lubricant applications such as wind turbines. According to CMAI, and measured by annual capacity data, we are the largest producer of polyisobutylene in the world. Applications for polyisobutylene are diverse, from cosmetics and personal care products, through sealants and adhesives to fuel additives. _INEOS Oxide. We manufacture ethylene and propylene oxides, from which we manufacture a range of_ derivatives including ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, acetate esters and ethylidene norbornene monomer. We believe, as measured by expected aggregate annual capacity for 2009, we are the largest producer of ethylene oxide and ethylene glycol in Western Europe and one of only two producers of ethylidene norbornene monomer in the world. Ethylene oxide is a highly reactive, flammable and toxic molecule. As a consequence, ethylene oxide producers typically use a significant proportion of their ethylene oxide for captive production or sell it to third parties located reasonably close to, or on, their ethylene oxide production sites. The majority of ethylene oxide produced in Western Europe is used for captive production and there are virtually no ethylene oxide imports into, or exports from, Western Europe. INEOS Oxide uses its ethylene oxide production for the captive production of ethylene glycol, ethylene oxide derivatives and sales to third parties. Our ethylene oxide derivatives include ethanolamine, a broad range of alkoxylates, glycol ethers and GasSpec™ gas treating amines. We own and operate one of the world’s largest ethanolamine units and produce a family of molecules which are used in applications such as agrochemicals, surfactants (used in personal care products and detergent formulations), cement additives, textile chemicals, metal working fluids, electronics and pigments. We have five alkoxylate reactors based in Antwerp which we use to make a broad range of alkoxylates used in household detergents, herbicides, industrial cleaners, petroleum production, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, synthetic lubricants and surface coating. We also operate one of Europe’s largest glycol ether assets to produce a range of methyl, ethyl and butyl glycol ethers used as solvents in surface coatings, inks, and as jet fuel de-icers. We also produce GasSpec™ gas treating amines, which are high performance specialty chemical formulations, often patent-protected, which are used in oil and gas processing in order to remove hydrogen sulphide and carbon dioxide from natural gas, gasoline and ammonia production streams. We are one of only two suppliers of ethylidene norbornene monomer globally and the only producer in Europe. Ethylidene norbornene monomer is used in the production of ethylene propylene diene monomer rubber, a 123 ----- high performance rubber that is both wear and weather resistant and is increasingly used in place of conventional rubbers in automobiles, roofing materials and household appliances. Ethylene glycol is used primarily as a feedstock to produce polyethylene terephthalate for film, fiber and resin and in a variety of other industrial applications including antifreeze/coolants for automotive vehicles. Ethyl acetate is primarily used as a solvent and diluent, favored because of its low cost, low toxicity, and agreeable odor. For example, it is commonly used to clean circuit boards and some nail varnish remover. Coffee beans and tea leaves are decaffeinated with this solvent. It is also used in paints as an activator or hardener and is present in confectionery, perfumes, and fruits. In addition, we produce acetate esters which are used as solvents in surface coatings, inks and pharmaceutical manufacturing. _INEOS Phenol. According to CMAI, measured by average annual capacity in 2009 we are the largest_ producer of phenol in the world. Phenol is a primary material for a large number of chemical products. In recent years, the use of phenol for the production of bisphenol A, an intermediate product used to produce polycarbonate and epoxy resins, has increased substantially and is now the largest phenol application. Polycarbonate is an engineering thermoplastic material which, due to its superior optical qualities, structural strength and weight, has a wide range of uses, including CDs and DVDs, optic-fibers, optical lenses, bullet proof glass and other ballistic resistant materials, structural parts in cars and trucks and housings for electrical household appliances and office equipment. The primary end use for epoxy resins is for printed circuit boards and adhesives. Phenol is also combined with formaldehyde to produce phenolic resins and is used in the production of caprolactam. Caprolactam is a precursor for polyamide (nylon) which is used in the textile industry and in a range of industrial applications, primarily due to its resistance to corrosive chemicals. Phenolic resins, which represent the second largest commercial use of phenol, are used in a wide range of applications, including in the manufacturing of plywood for use in housing, and furniture, in binders for the production of insulation materials, in laminates for the construction industry, in molds in the foundry industry and in adhesives. According to CMAI, measured by average annual capacity in 2009, we are the largest producer of acetone in the world. The largest commercial use of acetone is for solvents, either through the use of acetone itself as a solvent or through the acetone-based production of solvents. The second largest commercial use of acetone is the manufacture of methylmethacrylate. Methylmethacrylate is used to manufacture polymethylmethacrylate resins, including acrylic sheets and compounds for molding and extrusion. Acrylic sheets and compounds are used in a wide range of architectural and industrial applications, ranging from point of sale retail displays to glazing and decorative light panels. The third major use of acetone is in the production of bisphenol A. Alphamethylstyrene and Acetophenone are also produced as by-products from the phenol production process. _INEOS Enterprises. According to CMAI, measured by average annual capacity for 2009, INEOS_ Enterprises is the second largest provider of synthetic ethanol in the world. Due to the high level of purity of our synthetic ethanol compared with fermentation ethanol, we are able to market this product to the cosmetics and pharmaceuticals sectors. Our competitive position in the market is led by the cost benefits of our integrated status on the Grangemouth site, as we are the only producer with an integrated position. Ammonia production finds major application in the fertilizer industry, but is also used in the production of acrylonitrile and nylon. Nitric acid is similarly used in the fertilizer industry, but also finds application in the manufacture of polyurethanes. In this highly competitive market, we benefit from a cost base lower than that of many of our competitors, having an advantaged location within our Köln integrated petrochemical site and supplying 80% of our customer volume directly by pipeline. 124 ----- Vinyl Acetate Monomer is the major component of many emulsion paint and coating systems. It is also utilized in the production of adhesives and epoxy resins. We benefit from an integrated ethylene feedstock position with supply by pipeline, supporting the lower variable costs offered by our differentiated technology. Following the recent sale of the INEOS Fluor business, two activities have been retained with management oversight from INEOS Enterprises. The first is the CDM (clean development mechanism) business, which utilize proven technology for the abatement of fluorocarbon emissions. We are a participant in three CDM projects in India and Korea which successfully operate our abatement technology. Reductions in emissions are being achieved at all locations and following successful periodic verifications, certified emission reductions (CER’s) are issued by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which we then market. The second is the fluorspar mining business (Glebe Mines). This supplies fluorspar to the Runcorn, UK site. _INEOS Films. Our films business produces an extensive range of high quality rigid polyvinyl chloride_ films. Our business focuses on manufacturing and supplying rigid films to four major markets being pharmaceutical, cards, specialties and packaging. We have strong positions in the global sector of high quality secure cards, such as credit cards and phone cards, and in pharmaceutical blister packaging. These sectors typically feature higher margins than other film sectors. We believe that measured by volume, we are the second largest polyvinyl chloride film producer in Europe In addition, our films business produces Barex resin, which when processed into bottles, sheet or film, provides a high oxygen barrier material. This is then used in the packaging of a variety of products including longlife meat products, nicotine patches, cosmetics and fruit juices. _INEOS Technologies. INEOS Technologies is a leading developer and licensor of polyolefin, polystyrene,_ nitriles, maleic anhydride, vinyls, and chlor-alkali technologies to the global petrochemical industry. It manufactures and supplies high quality catalysts and additives in support of these technologies to major companies around the world as well as to our own manufacturing assets. We view technology licensing as an effective way of establishing our products in the market and of generating additional income. In addition, we believe that the ability to offer a comprehensive technology package is a substantial advantage in attracting potential joint venture partners for equity investments in regions characterized by low feedstock costs and high growth, such as the Middle East, North Africa, Russia and China. Our approach to licensing varies from technology to technology to take into account the prevailing market conditions. For example, licensing of acrylonitrile technology is highly selective, whereas our gas phase polyethylene technology is licensed widely. Under INEOS’ ownership, the business has grown its overall licensing market share in all product lines, and on the basis of 2008 and 2009 market shares, we have become the leading licensor of polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinylchloride, vinyl chloride monomer, ethylene dichloride, and acrylonitrile technologies. A total of 18 major new licenses have been agreed since the beginning of 2008, through the activities of our sales offices located in Lisle, USA, Lyndhurst, UK and Shanghai, China. We market and sell the catalysts and additives required to operate the processes. We manufacture catalysts for polyethylene, acrylonitrile and maleic anhydride in its own facilities, and have established toll-manufacturing arrangements for polypropylene catalysts, ethylene dichloride catalysts, and some polyethylene catalysts, and for process additives for the polyvinylchloride process. Manufacturing facilities exist in Lima, USA (acrylonitrile catalysts), Green Lake, USA (maleic anhydride catalysts) Lavéra, France and Sarralbe, France (both polyethylene catalysts). In order to sustain the competitiveness of its process technologies and catalysts, we invest a substantial proportion of our Technology profits in research and development. We have major research centers in Naperville, USA, and Lavéra, France. In addition, the business has research or pilot facilities in Grangemouth, Scotland, Nederover-Heembeek, Belgium, Runcorn, England, and Porto Marghera, Italy. 125 ----- Our proprietary gas phase polyethylene technology serves the linear low-density polyethylene and highdensity polyethylene markets, which are the fastest growing segments of the commodity polyethylene markets. We own a specialized technology for the manufacture of high-density polyethylene, acquired from Solvay. This technology is based on a slurry production process and is characterized by low capital and operating costs. Our technology is based on a chemical process for the transformation of propylene into acrylonitrile called ammoxidation. We have provided five generations of acrylonitrile catalysts, and there is continuing industry demand for these catalysts. Our polyvinyl chloride process allows for rapid production rates without the need for chilled water to cool the reactors, providing substantial capital savings by eliminating the need for expensive refrigeration systems. We have developed and sell a range of leading additives to enable smooth and optimized running of the polyvinyl chloride production process.

HSE laws and regulations govern our facilities and our operations, including the manufacture, storage, handling, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, water discharges, air emissions (including greenhouse gas emissions), operation and closure of landfills, human health and safety, and the clean-up of contaminated sites. Many of our operations require permits and controls to monitor or prevent pollution. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, substantial ongoing capital and operating expenditures to ensure compliance with current and future HSE laws, regulations and permits or the more stringent enforcement of such requirements. For example, we expect to incur approximately €400 million for HSE-related costs during the period from 2010 through 2014, of which €260 million in capital costs relates to the upgrade or replacement of equipment at our refinery sites in Grangemouth, UK and Lavéra, France. We also expect to incur expenditures of approximately €20 million during the period from 2015 through 2020. Given the nature of our business, violations of HSE requirements may result in substantial fines or penalties, the imposition of other civil or criminal sanctions, cleanup costs, claims for personal injury or property damages, the installation of costly pollution control equipment, or restrictions on, or the suspension of, our operating activities. In addition, HSE laws and regulations can impose various financial responsibility requirements on us, and pursuant to these requirements we may be required to post bonds, create trust funds or provide other assurances that we will be able to remediate contamination at our sites and comply with our decommissioning obligations once our facilities reach the end of their useful lives. Our environmental management systems are intended to ensure that we both comply with applicable environmental requirements and minimize environmental risk by promoting environmental protection activities and initiatives. We actively address environmental compliance issues in connection with our operations and properties and we believe that we have systems in place to ensure that environmental costs and liabilities will not have a material adverse impact on us. Nevertheless, estimates of future environmental costs and liabilities are inherently imprecise, and the imposition of unanticipated costs or obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations in any period in which those costs are incurred.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

Industrial sites receive allowances to emit carbon dioxide and must surrender one allowance for each ton of carbon dioxide emitted. Companies which emit less carbon dioxide than their allowances cover are able to sell the excess allowances, whereas those which emit more must buy additional allowances through the EU ETS. In addition, in response to the United Kingdom Climate Change Levy, we belong to CIABATA, a division of the Chemical Industries Association established for the trading of energy credits related to emissions of carbon dioxide. As a member of CIABATA, we currently receive an 80% rebate on the amount of climate change levy we have to pay. _U.S. Clean Air Act and Climate Change Regulations_ In the United States, the Federal Clean Air Act regulates air emissions from various sources and requires, among other things, monitoring of specified pollutants, including hazardous air pollutants, stringent air emission limits and technological controls to reduce emissions to air, and operating permits for chemical plants. Facilities with Title V permits are required to make regular reports, certify compliance with operating permit conditions and report all deviations from any operating permit conditions. Strict federal and state controls on ozone, carbon monoxide, benzene, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions impact our activities and increase our costs to operate and maintain facilities in the United States. Growing concern about the sources and impacts of global climate change has led to a number of legislative and administrative measures, both proposed and enacted, to monitor, regulate and limit carbon dioxide and other GHG emissions. As of January 2010, we are required to monitor and report to the EPA annual GHG emissions from certain of our facilities. In addition, the U.S. Congress is debating several legislative proposals, each of which would seek to establish a nationwide cap-and-trade program for GHGs, which would apply to industrial and other facilities and would set emissions limits or caps that would be reduced over time. Companies which fail to reduce their emissions below the applicable limits would be required to purchase allowances to emit GHGs through market-based auctions. If climate change legislation is not enacted by the U.S. Congress, the EPA is expected to finalize a rule for regulating GHG emissions from large stationary sources, such as our facilities, under the Clean Air Act in 2011. At the international level, in December 2009 more than 27 nations, including the United States and China, signed the Copenhagen Accord, which includes a non-binding commitment to reduce GHG emissions. The international community is continuing to negotiate a binding treaty that would require reductions in GHG emissions by developed countries. Although we believe it is likely that GHG emissions will be regulated in the U.S. and other countries (as well as in the EU) in the near future, we cannot yet predict the form such regulation will take (such as a cap-and-trade program, technology mandate, emissions tax or other regulatory mechanism) or, consequently, to estimate any costs that we may be required to incur, for example, to install emissions control equipment, purchase emissions allowances, or address other regulatory obligations. Such requirements could also adversely affect our energy supply, or the costs (and types) of raw materials we use for fuel. Regulations controlling or limiting GHG emissions could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations, including by reducing demand for our products.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

The Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals, or REACH, Regulation, which came into effect in 133 ----- 2007, requires the registration of all chemicals manufactured and imported into the EU (either alone, in mixtures or in articles) with the new European Chemicals Agency (“ECHA”), which is located in Helsinki, Finland. The regulation requires formal documentation of the relevant data required for hazard assessments for each substance registered as well as development of risk assessments for their registered uses. Most uses of high hazard substances, such as carcinogens, will require authorization by the ECHA. As a corollary to the REACH Regulation, the EU has recently adopted the Classification, Labeling and Packaging Regulation to harmonize the EU’s system of classifying, labeling and packaging chemical substances with the United Nation’s Globally Harmonized System. The Regulation is expected to standardize communication of hazard information of chemicals and to promote regulatory efficiency. It introduces new classification criteria, hazard symbols and labeling phrases, while taking account of elements that are part of the current EU legislation. In the U.S., some of our products and our raw materials are subject to extensive environmental, health and industrial hygiene regulations, including under TSCA, requiring registration and safety analysis of the substances contained in them. Such regulations could result in a key raw material, chemical or substance being classified or reclassified as having a toxicological or health-related impact on the environment, on users of our products, or on our employees. Such reclassification of any of our raw materials or products could affect its availability or marketability, result in a ban on its purchase or sale, or require us to incur increased costs to comply with notification, labeling or handling requirements.

An EU directive on the control of major accident hazards, otherwise known as the Seveso II Directive (the “Directive”), regulates facilities that present a risk of accidents involving dangerous substances and imposes specific plans and procedures on them, particularly for the storage of such substances. The Directive provides for control measures aimed at preventing and limiting the consequences of major accidents. All of our major production sites are in the top tier of regulation under the Directive due to the quantity of dangerous substances stored at them. As such, we must establish a major accident prevention policy, safety reporting system, safety management system and emergency plan compliant with the requirements of the Directive. In the U.S., all of our manufacturing facilities are subject to the EPA’s Risk Management Program (“RMP”), which requires facilities that produce, handle, process, distribute or store certain highly hazardous chemicals to develop a risk management plan and program in the event of an accidental release of such chemicals. RMP also requires facilities to assess potential impacts to off-site populations in the event of a credible worst-case release and to document the policies, procedures, equipment and work practices in place to mitigate identified risks. In addition, our U.S. facilities are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration Process Safety Management (“PSM”) standard, which requires development of a program to manage workplace risks associated with highly hazardous chemicals. No material costs have been identified at any of our sites with respect to operational risk assessment under the Directive, RMP or PSM. In addition, all of our businesses are aware that effective safety management is consciously required to address and deal with these risks. We promote personal leadership for the management of these risks and our board of directors operates a business “Letter of Assurance” process whereby each of the Business Operations Directors reviews compliance with local regulations and the effectiveness of the safety management system. They then formally inform their Executive Team and Chief Executive in writing about any issues about which they need to be concerned. This process provides assurance that all businesses are in compliance in all material respects with applicable health, safety and environmental laws in the countries in which they operate. 134 ----- We have several business challenges, but most important is the process safety of our operations.

We could also be responsible for investigating and cleaning up contamination at off-site locations where we or our predecessors disposed of or arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous wastes. Under some environmental laws, liability can be imposed regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the contamination and regardless of whether the practices that resulted in the contamination were legal at the time they occurred. In connection with contaminated properties, as well as our operations generally, we also could be subject to claims by government authorities, individuals and other third parties seeking damages for alleged personal injury or property damage resulting from hazardous substance contamination or exposure caused by our operations, facilities or products. Based on current knowledge of site conditions and existing law and practice, we do not believe we currently have any material obligations or costs for investigation or remediation activities at our current or former facilities. Baseline surveys of soil and groundwater conditions were conducted at many of our sites in the EU in connection with obtaining our IPPC permits, and such data was reported to the relevant authorities. In addition, many of our other sites were the subject of intrusive investigations when they were acquired by us or in connection with historical activities or operational changes over the years.

On January 28, 2010, we transferred certain business engaged in the production of chlor-alkali and PVC to Kerling. See “Summary—Recent Developments—Split-off of Our ChlorVinyls Businesses.” Kerling has an agreement with INEOS Olefins, a business division of the INEOS Group, pursuant to which they obtain the ethylene required for vinyl chloride monomer (“VCM”) and polyvinyl chloride (“PVC”) production at their Runcorn, United Kingdom, facility by direct pipeline from INEOS Olefins’ ethylene cracker in Grangemouth, Scotland through the United Kingdom ethylene pipeline system, which also gives them access to various other suppliers. Ethylene from the Grangemouth cracker is also shipped to the Kerling VCM and PVC production facility in Wilhelmshaven, Germany. The agreement runs from 2008 through 2011, and on a continuous basis thereafter, unless earlier terminated by either party upon two years’ notice. The total annual supply volume that Kerling is entitled to obtain pursuant to the agreement ranges from 117 to 143 kilotonnes for the Runcorn facility and 99 to 121 kilotonnes for the Wilhelmshaven facility. These supply volumes are subject to periodic adjustments by both parties. Prices under the agreement are generated by reference to market indicators, in particular the monthly contract price for ethylene quoted in ICIS ethylene pricing reports. INEOS Olefins’ agreement with Kerling is on terms no less favorable to them than what they would expect to negotiate with disinterested third parties, including other suppliers connected to the United Kingdom ethylene pipeline system. As recently as 2007, Kerling purchased the majority of their ethylene requirements at Runcorn and Wilhesmshaven from suppliers other than us.

Noretyl AS operates a hydrocarbon cracking plant in Rafnes, Norway, from which Kerling is entitled to obtain approximately 288 kilotonnes of ethylene per year (approximately 50% of the facility’s total production) pursuant to a processing agreement between them and INEOS Bamble AS. Pursuant to the agreement, the ethylene is piped directly to Kerling’s VCM and PVC plant at Rafnes and shipped to their Stenungsund, Sweden, facility.

On April 9, 2009 INEOS Holdings Limited, among others, entered into an amendment agreement to reduce the overall facility amount to €1.2 billion for the remaining term of the facility and to increase the margins on amounts drawn and the commitment fee on amounts undrawn. The Securitization Program complies with the terms for a “Permitted Receivables Securitization” as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement. Under the Securitization Program, all trade receivables originated by the Sellers (other than those receivables that are specifically identified as “excluded receivables”) are sold to a bankruptcy-remote special purpose vehicle incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Ireland, INEOS Finance (Ireland) Limited (the “SPV”). The SPV finances these purchases from borrowings, primarily funded through asset-backed commercial paper (“ABCP”) conduits. The cost of funding for the ABCP conduits reflects the rating of the pooled financial assets in which they invest, thus allowing the Securitization Program to benefit from financing costs that are not linked to the group’s corporate rating. The Securitization Program is restricted to receivables denominated in U.S. Dollars, euros or Sterling that are sold to the SPV at face value less a small discount to reflect the carry cost until settlement. In some jurisdictions, the sale of the receivables requires the involvement of an intermediate purchaser in order to comply with local securities and banking regulations. The SPV acquires title, on a non-recourse basis, to new receivables as the liability arises and settles its purchases with the Sellers on a twice-monthly basis. Between settlement dates, the Sellers have the use of the cash received from customers which has been paid into segregated bank accounts, either in the name of the SPV or held on trust for the SPV. Responsibility for the administration of the receivables, including adherence to established credit and collection policies remains with the Sellers, with INEOS Holdings Limited acting on their behalf in its capacity as Master Servicer. The twice-monthly settlement period is tied to the term of the loans advanced to the SPV by the lenders against the security of the outstanding receivables. The lenders’ advance rate is adjusted each month to reflect the actual performance of the receivables portfolio and standard Rating Agency methodology for calculating loss and dilution reserves and other potential shortfalls. The balance of the SPV’s funding requirements to purchase receivables is provided by INEOS Holdings Limited through a subordinated loan facility. Subject to satisfaction of the conditions to the Exchange Offer and Consent Request, it is intended that the Securitization Program will be amended to: (i) extend the maturity to July 7, 2013; (ii) reduce the overall facility amount to €1 billion; and (iii) increase the margins on amounts drawn and the commitment fee on amounts undrawn. 165 -----",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

In the event that the Issuer, the Parent, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the security interests created under the Security Documents could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of the security interests is successful, the holders of the Notes may not be able to recover any amounts under the Security Documents.

The Security Trustee will only be permitted to enforce the Security Documents in accordance with instructions permitted to be given under the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement restricts the ability of the Notes Trustee or the holders of the Notes to instruct the Security Trustee to take enforcement action and the Security Trustee will act only at the direction of creditors with respect to the then outstanding Senior Secured Indebtedness, other than holders of the Notes and any Additional Notes, until the aggregate amount of committed or funded Senior Secured Indebtedness, other than debt under the Notes and any other senior secured notes that may accede to the Intercreditor Agreement in the future, is less than 30% of the aggregate principal amount of all committed or funded Senior Secured Indebtedness (including the Notes and any other senior secured notes that may accede to the Intercreditor Agreement).

The BP Creditor Liabilities are secured by a first priority interest in the BP Shared 175 ----- Collateral. The holders of Existing Parent Notes have, subject to Permitted Collateral Liens, a third priority interest in the Existing Parent Notes Shared Collateral. _Release of Security_ The Liens on the Collateral will be automatically and unconditionally released without any action by the Notes Trustee or Security Trustee, as the case may be, or the holders of the Notes: (a) in connection with any sale or other disposition of the property or assets to a Person that is not the Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale or other disposition complies with the requirements of the covenant set forth under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets,” regardless of whether such requirements are otherwise applicable, or is otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture; (b) if such Collateral is an asset of a Subsidiary Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries or a Holdco Group Guarantor (other than Tenderco or the Parent), in connection with any sale or other disposition of Capital Stock of that Guarantor to a Person that is not the Issuer, the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary that complies with the requirements of the covenant set forth under “— _Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets;”_ (c) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor; (d) if the Parent designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Subsidiary; (e) upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as provided below under the captions “—Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance of the Indenture” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge;” (f) as described under “—Modifications and Amendments;” or (g) in connection with an enforcement sale pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement.

No appraisal of any of the Collateral has been prepared by or on behalf of the Issuer, the Parent or the Company in connection with the issuance of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the proceeds from the sale of the Collateral remaining after sharing with other creditors entitled to share in such proceeds would be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the holders of the Notes. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral will be able to be sold in a short period of time, if at all. In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement places limitations on the ability of the Security Trustee to cause the sale of the Collateral, by reference to the interests of certain creditors, including the holders of the Notes and the Existing Parent Notes. These limitations may include requirements that some or all of the Collateral be disposed of only pursuant to public auctions or only at a price confirmed by a valuation.

If that dollar amount is less than the dollar amount expressed to be due to the recipient under any Dollar Note, the Issuer and each Guarantor of the Dollar Notes, jointly and severally, shall indemnify the recipient against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this indemnity, it will be sufficient for the holder to certify (indicating the sources of information used) that it would have suffered a loss had the actual purchase of dollars been made with the amount so received in that other currency on the date of receipt or recovery (or, if a purchase of dollars on such date had not been possible, on the first date on which it would have been possible).

Within 30 days of any Change of Control, the Issuer shall notify the Notes Trustee thereof and give written notice of such Change of Control to each holder of Notes by first class mail, postage prepaid, at the address appearing in the security register, stating, among other things: - that a Change of Control has occurred and the date of such event; - the circumstances and relevant facts regarding such Change of Control (including, but not limited to, applicable information with respect to pro forma historical income, cash flow and capitalization after giving effect to the Change of Control); - the purchase price and the purchase date which shall be fixed by the Issuer on a Business Day no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed, or such later date as is necessary to comply with requirements under the U.S. Exchange Act; - that any Note not tendered will continue to accrue interest and unless the Issuer defaults in payment of the Change of Control Purchase Price, any Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer shall cease to accrue interest after the Change of Control Purchase Date; and - certain other procedures that a holder of Notes must follow to accept a Change of Control Offer or to withdraw such acceptance.

The ability of the Issuer to repurchase Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control would constitute a mandatory prepayment event and/or a default due to a breach of undertaking under the Senior Facilities Agreement. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control under the Senior Facilities Agreement may not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture. The future Indebtedness of the Issuer, the Parent and its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the holders of the Notes of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the 184 ----- Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer and the Company. Finally, the ability of the Issuer to pay cash to the holders of the Notes upon a repurchase may be limited by its and the Company’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the holders of the Notes to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a holder’s right to require the Issuer to repurchase such holder’s Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer, the Parent or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. The Paying Agent will promptly mail to each holder of Notes properly tendered the Change of Control Purchase Price for such Notes and the Notes Trustee (or an authentication agent appointed by it (the “Authentication Agent”)) will, in respect of the global notes, make such notations thereon as are necessary to reflect the Notes (or interest therein) purchased in such Change of Control Offer and, in respect of certificated notes, cause to be authenticated and mailed to each Holder a new note or notes equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new note will be in a principal amount of €50,000 or $100,000, as applicable, or an integral multiple of €1,000 or $1,000, as applicable, in excess thereof. The Issuer will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on, or as soon as practicable after, the Change of Control Purchase Date. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether the Issuer must make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The Issuer will comply with the applicable tender offer rules, including Rule 14e-1 under the U.S. Exchange Act, and any other applicable securities laws or regulations (including those of the United States and the United Kingdom) in connection with a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any applicable securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of this covenant (other than the obligation to make an offer pursuant to this covenant), the Issuer will comply with the securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in this covenant by virtue thereof.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

provided that the maximum liability of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in respect of all such Indebtedness shall at no time exceed the gross proceeds, including the Fair Market Value of non-cash proceeds (measured at the time received and without giving effect to any subsequent changes in value), actually received by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with such disposition;

and (23) Indebtedness of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in addition to that described in clauses (1) through (22) above, and any renewals, extensions, substitutions, refinancings or replacements of such Indebtedness, so long as the aggregate principal amount of all such Indebtedness shall not exceed €350.0 million outstanding at any one time in the aggregate. For purposes of determining compliance with this “Limitation on Indebtedness” covenant, in the event that an item of Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Indebtedness described in 188 ----- clauses (1) through (23) above, or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to the paragraph (a) of this covenant, the Company will be permitted to classify such item of Indebtedness on the date of its incurrence and, except with respect to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities incurred under clause (b)(1) of this covenant, reclassify such item of Indebtedness, in each case at any time and in any manner that complies with this covenant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities outstanding on the Issue Date up to the maximum amounts permitted under clause (b)(1) of this covenant will be deemed to have been incurred pursuant to clause (b)(1) of this covenant. For purposes of determining any particular amount of Indebtedness under this “Limitation on Indebtedness” covenant, guarantees, Liens or obligations with respect to letters of credit supporting Indebtedness otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount will not be included. For purposes of determining compliance with this “Limitation on Indebtedness” covenant, the principal amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined in conformity with IFRS. Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value and the payment of interest in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this covenant. For purposes of determining compliance with any Euro-denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness where Indebtedness is denominated in a different currency, the amount of such Indebtedness will be the Euro Equivalent determined on the date of such determination; provided, however, that if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Hedging Agreement (with respect to Euro) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in Euro will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement. The principal amount of any Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred pursuant to clause (13) above, if incurred in the same currency as the Indebtedness being refinanced, will be the Euro Equivalent of the Indebtedness refinanced, determined on the date such Indebtedness being refinanced was initially incurred. The principal amount of any Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred pursuant to clause (13) above, if incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, will be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. Notwithstanding any other provision of this “Limitation on Indebtedness” covenant, the maximum amount that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may incur pursuant to this “Limitation on Indebtedness” covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded, with respect to any outstanding Indebtedness, due solely to the result of fluctuations in the exchange rates of currencies. For the purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness. _Limitation on Restricted Payments_ (a) The Company will not, and will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly take any of the following activities (each of which, other than any such action that is a Permitted Payment (as defined below) is a “Restricted Payment” and which are collectively known as “Restricted Payments”): (1) declare or pay any dividend on, or make any distribution on (A) prior to the Holdco Group Transaction Date, the Company’s Capital Stock and (B) after the Holdco Group Transaction Date, Topco’s Capital Stock to any Person (other than dividends or distributions payable solely in shares of its Qualified Capital Stock or in options, warrants or other rights to acquire shares of such Qualified Capital Stock) or make any payment of cash interest in respect of Subordinated Shareholder Funding; (2) purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value, directly or indirectly, (A) prior to the Holdco Group Transaction Date, the Company’s Capital Stock or, after the Holdco Group Transaction Date, Topco’s Capital Stock, or any Capital Stock of any 189 ----- Affiliate of the Company or Topco, as applicable (other than a Restricted Subsidiary) held by Persons other than the Company or Topco, as the case may be, or a Restricted Subsidiary, (B) options, warrants or other rights to acquire such Capital Stock or (C) any Subordinated Shareholder Funding held by any Person; (3) make any principal payment on, or repurchase, redeem, defease, retire or otherwise acquire for value, prior to any scheduled principal payment, sinking fund payment or maturity, any Subordinated Indebtedness of the type described in clause (b) of the definition thereof (other than the purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement of (A) Subordinated Indebtedness in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal installment or final maturity, in each case, due within one year of the date of purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement and (B) any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to clauses (7) or (8) of paragraph (b) of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”) or any Subordinated Shareholder Funding; (4) declare or pay any dividend or distribution on any Capital Stock of any Restricted Subsidiary to any Person (other than (A) to the Company or any of its Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiaries, (B) dividends or distributions made by a Restricted Subsidiary on a pro rata basis to all stockholders of such Restricted Subsidiary or (C) dividends or distributions payable solely in its Qualified Capital Stock or in options, warrants or other rights to acquire shares of such Qualified Capital Stock or in Subordinated Shareholder Funding); or (5) make any Investment in any Person (other than any Permitted Investments).

(4) the repurchase, redemption, defeasance, retirement, refinancing, acquisition for value or payment of principal of any Subordinated Indebtedness (other than Redeemable Capital Stock and Subordinated Shareholder Funding) through the substantially concurrent issuance of new Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that qualifies as Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness;

(b) If all or a portion of the Net Cash Proceeds of any Asset Sale is not required to be applied to repurchase or repay permanently any Indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities (or any Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof) then outstanding as required by the terms thereof, or the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary determines not to apply such Net Cash Proceeds to the permanent prepayment of such Indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities (or any Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof) or other Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is not Pari Passu Indebtedness or Subordinated Indebtedness of the type described in clause (b) of the definition thereof, or if no such Indebtedness is then outstanding, then the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may within 365 days of the Asset Sale invest, or commit to invest (provided that it actually invests within the later of 365 days of the Asset Sale and 90 days of the commitment), the Net Cash Proceeds in properties and other assets (including Capital Stock of a business) that (as determined by the board of directors of the Company) replace the properties and assets that were the subject of the Asset Sale or in properties and assets that will be used in or are related to the businesses of the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries existing on the date of the Indenture. The amount of Net Cash Proceeds not used or invested within 365 days of the Asset Sale or invested within the later of 365 days of the Asset Sale and 90 days of a commitment to invest as set forth in this paragraph constitutes “Excess Proceeds.” Pending the final application of the Net Cash Proceeds, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary may temporarily reduce Indebtedness or otherwise invest such Net Cash Proceeds in Temporary Cash Investments. (c) When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds €25.0 million, the Issuer (or the Company on the Issuer’s behalf) will apply the Excess Proceeds to the repayment of Indebtedness under the Notes and any other _Pari Passu Indebtedness (which shall be deemed to include any Permitted Receivables Financing) outstanding with similar provisions requiring the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary to make an offer to purchase such Indebtedness with the proceeds from any Asset Sale as follows: (1) the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary will make an offer to purchase (an “Offer”) from all holders of the Notes in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture in the maximum principal amount (expressed as a multiple of €1,000 in the case of Euro Notes 197 ----- and $1,000 in the case of Dollar Notes) of Notes that may be purchased out of an amount (the “Note Amount”) equal to the product of such Excess Proceeds multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the outstanding principal amount of the Notes, and the denominator of which is the sum of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness (subject to proration in the event such amount is less than the aggregate Offered Price (as defined herein) of all Notes tendered); (2) to the extent required by such _Pari Passu Indebtedness to permanently reduce the principal amount of such _Pari Passu Indebtedness, the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, will make an offer to purchase or otherwise repurchase or redeem Pari Passu Indebtedness (a “Pari Passu Offer”) in an amount (the “Pari Passu",N/A,as_expected,2010,455
1224_1,Offerings 2010.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.17,Debt Amount”) equal to the excess of the Excess Proceeds over the Note Amount;,21.17.1,,"_provided that in no event will the Issuer, the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary be_ required to make a _Pari Passu Offer in a_ _Pari Passu Debt Amount exceeding the principal amount of such _Pari Passu Indebtedness plus the amount of any premium required to be paid to repurchase such Pari Passu Indebtedness; and (3) the offer price for the Notes will be payable in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date (the “Offer Date”) such Offer is consummated (the “Offered Price”), in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture. To the extent that the aggregate Offered Price of the Notes tendered pursuant to the Offer is less than the Note Amount relating thereto or the aggregate amount of Pari Passu Indebtedness that is purchased in a Pari Passu Offer is less than the Pari Passu Debt Amount, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and _Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders thereof exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Notes Trustee shall select the Notes to be purchased on a pro rata basis. Upon the completion of the purchase of all the Notes tendered pursuant to an Offer and the completion of a Pari Passu Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds, if any, shall be reset at zero. (d) If the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary becomes obligated to make an Offer pursuant to clause (c) above, the Notes and the Pari Passu Indebtedness shall be purchased by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, at the option of the holders thereof, in whole or in part (in a principal amount of €50,000, in the case of Euro Notes, or $100,000, in the case of Dollar Notes, or an integral multiple of €1,000 or $1,000, as applicable, in excess thereof, such that no Euro Note of less than €50,000 or Dollar Note of less than $100,000 remains outstanding thereafter) on a date that is not earlier than 30 days and not later than 60 days from the date the notice of the Offer is given to holders, or such later date as may be necessary for the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary to comply with the requirements under the U.S. Exchange Act or other applicable laws or regulations (including, without limitation, those of any securities exchange on which the Notes are listed). (e) The Indenture will provide that, if the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary is required to make an Offer, the Company and such Restricted Subsidiary will comply with the applicable tender offer rules, including Rule 14e-1 under the U.S. Exchange Act, and any other applicable securities laws or regulations (including those of the United States and the United Kingdom) in connection with an Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any applicable securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of this covenant (other than the obligation to make an Offer pursuant to this covenant), the Company and such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, will comply with the securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in this covenant by virtue thereof. (f) If the Offer Date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment date, any accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name a Note is registered 198 ----- at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to holders of the Notes who tender Notes pursuant to the Offer. (g) For the purposes of clause (a)(1) of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be cash: (1) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company from the transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Temporary Cash Investments within 90 days following the closing of such Asset Sale; (2) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Sale, _provided_ that that the Company and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Sale; (3) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the type described in clause (b) of the definition thereof) received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; and (4) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Parent of any Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed 2.5% of Total Assets. _Limitation on Issuance of Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries_ (a) The Company will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary (which is not a Guarantor or the Issuer), directly or indirectly, to guarantee, assume or in any other manner become liable with respect to (i) any Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary under any Credit Facilities or (ii) any Public Debt (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any guarantee of Public Debt) of the Issuer or any Guarantor, unless such Restricted Subsidiary simultaneously executes and delivers a supplemental indenture to the Indenture providing for a Guarantee of the Notes on the same terms as the other Guarantees of the Notes by the Guarantors, except that: (1) no Guarantee shall be required as a result of any guarantee of Indebtedness that existed at the time such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary if the guarantee was not incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary; (2) no Guarantee shall be required as a result of any guarantee in connection with a Permitted Receivables Financing; (3) such Guarantee need not be secured unless required pursuant to the “Limitation on Liens” covenant; (4) if such Indebtedness is by its terms expressly subordinated to the Notes or any Guarantee, any such assumption, guarantee or other liability of such Restricted Subsidiary with respect to such Indebtedness shall be subordinated to such Restricted Subsidiary’s Guarantee of the Notes at least to the same extent as such Indebtedness is subordinated to the Notes or any other Guarantee; (5) no Guarantee shall be required as a result of any guarantee given to a bank or trust company incorporated in any member state of the European Union as of the date of the Indenture or any commercial banking institution that is a member of the U.S. Federal Reserve System (or any branch, Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof), in each case having 199 ----- combined capital and surplus and undivided profits of not less than €500.0 million, whose debt has a rating, at the time such guarantee was given, of at least A or the equivalent thereof by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw Hill Companies, Inc. (“S&P”) and at least A2 or the equivalent thereof by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”), in connection with the operation of cash management programs established for the Company’s benefit or that of any Restricted Subsidiary; (6) no Guarantee shall be required if such Guarantee could reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in (A) personal liability for the officers, directors or shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary, (B) any violation of applicable law that cannot be avoided or otherwise prevented through measures reasonably available to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary or (C) any significant cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect of any Taxes) other than reasonable out of pocket expenses and other than reasonable expenses incurred in connection with any governmental or regulatory filings required as a result of, or any measures pursuant to clause (B) undertaken in connection with, such Guarantee, which cannot be avoided through measures reasonably available to the Company or the Restricted Subsidiary; and (7) each such Guarantee will be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Guarantee by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Notes created pursuant to the provisions in paragraph (a) above may provide by its terms that it shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon: (1) any sale, exchange or transfer, directly or indirectly, to any Person that is not the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, of all of the Capital Stock held by the Company and other Restricted Subsidiaries in, or all or substantially all the assets of, such Restricted Subsidiary (which sale, exchange or transfer is not prohibited by the Indenture) and such Restricted Subsidiary is released from all guarantees, if any, by it of other Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiaries; (2) (with respect to any Guarantees created after the date of the Indenture) the release by the holders of the Indebtedness of the Company or Restricted Subsidiary described in clause (a) above of their security interest or their Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary at such time as (A) no other Indebtedness of the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary has been secured or guaranteed by such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, or (B) the holders of all such other Indebtedness which is secured or guaranteed by such Restricted Subsidiary also release their security interest in or Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary; (3) any defeasance or discharge of the Notes as provided in “Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance of Indenture” or “Satisfaction and Discharge;” or (4) the satisfaction of the requirements of any of the other provisions described under “The Guarantees—Release of the Guarantees.” 200 ----- _Limitation on Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries_ (a) The Company will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create or otherwise cause to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to: (1) pay dividends or make any other distribution on its Capital Stock or any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; (2) pay any Indebtedness owed to the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary; (3) make any loans or advances to the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary; or (4) transfer any of its properties or assets to the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary, _provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating_ distributions prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including the application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness incurred by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction. (b) the provisions of clauses (1) to (4) of paragraph (a) above will not prohibit: (1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (A) any agreement in effect on the date of the Indenture (including the Senior Facilities Agreement) and (B) any indenture for any Public Debt of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; (2) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company on the date of the Indenture in existence at the time such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company and not incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary; _provided that such encumbrances and restrictions are not applicable to the Company or_ any Restricted Subsidiary or the properties or assets of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary other than such Subsidiary which is becoming a Restricted Subsidiary; (3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or relating to any Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person which is assumed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of assets (other than Capital Stock or Indebtedness incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary entered into such transaction) and outstanding on such date, which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of any Person, other than the Person, or property or assets or capital stock of the Person, so acquired; (4) any encumbrance or restriction under the Indenture and the Notes (including Additional Notes); (5) any encumbrance or restriction under Purchase Money Obligations and Capital Lease Obligations in the ordinary course of business that impose restrictions with respect only to the property the subject thereof of the nature described in clause (6) of this paragraph (b) on the property so acquired or any restriction pursuant to a joint venture agreement that imposes restrictions on the transfer of the assets of the joint venture;

(7) contracts for the sale of assets, including any restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary pending the closing of such sale or disposition; (8) restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by leases or other agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business; (9) any customary encumbrances or restrictions created under any agreement (A) with respect to Indebtedness permitted to be incurred subsequent to the date of the Indenture pursuant to the provisions of the covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on _Indebtedness” if (i) the encumbrances and restrictions are not materially less favorable to_ the holders of the Notes than those contained in the Senior Facilities Agreement on the date of the Indenture or (ii) the encumbrances and restrictions are materially less favorable to the holders of the Notes than is customary in comparable financings (as determined in good faith by the Company) and the Company determines at the time of the incurrence of such Indebtedness that such encumbrances or restrictions will not adversely affect, in any material respect, the Issuer’s ability to make principal or interest payments on the Notes or the Company’s ability to make principal or interest payments on the Funding Loans or (B) constituting an additional intercreditor agreement entered into in compliance with the covenant described under “—Additional Intercreditor _Agreements” below;_ (10) any encumbrances or restrictions required by any governmental, local or regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or any of their businesses; (11) customary provisions in joint venture agreements; _provided,_ _however, that any such encumbrance or restriction is applicable only to such Restricted Subsidiary and provided, _further, that the Company determines that any such encumbrance or restriction will not_ materially affect the ability of the Issuer and the Company to make any anticipated principal or interest payments on the Notes and the Funding Loans, as applicable; (12) with respect to clauses (1) and (4) of paragraph (a) above only, encumbrance or restrictions existing by reason of any lien permitted under “—Limitation on Liens;” (13) any encumbrance or restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers under agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business;

202 ----- (16) contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business, not relating to Indebtedness, and that do not, individually or in the aggregate, (a) detract from the value of property or assets of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company in any manner material to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary or (b) materially interfere with the Issuer’s ability to make payments of principal or interest in respect of the Notes; and (17) any encumbrance or restriction existing under any agreement that extends, renews, refinances or replaces the agreements containing the encumbrances or restrictions in the foregoing clauses (1) through (16) or in this clause (17); _provided that the terms and conditions of any such encumbrances or restrictions are no more restrictive in any material respect than those under or pursuant to the agreement evidencing the Indebtedness so extended, renewed, refinanced or replaced. _Limitation on Layered Debt_ The Issuer will not, and the Company will not permit any other Guarantor to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise in any manner become directly or indirectly liable for or with respect to or otherwise permit to exist any Indebtedness (including Permitted Indebtedness) that is subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor unless such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or the Guarantor’s Guarantee (as applicable) and, if such Guarantor is the Company, the Funding Loans, on substantially identical terms; provided, however, that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured with different collateral, by virtue of being secured on a first or junior priority basis or by virtue of not being guaranteed. In addition, junior liens, second liens and other contractual arrangements that provide for priorities among holders of the same or different issues of Indebtedness with respect to any collateral or the proceeds of collateral or tranching of debt under Credit Facilities shall not constitute subordination in right of payment. 203 ----- _Limitation on Unrestricted Subsidiaries_ The Parent may designate, after the date of the Indenture, any Subsidiary (other than the Company, Tenderco, the Issuer or any Holdco Group Guarantor) as an “Unrestricted Subsidiary” under the Indenture (a “Designation”) only if: (a) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of or after giving effect to such Designation or would occur as a consequence of such Designation; (b) either (i) the Subsidiary to be so designated has total assets of €1,000 or less or (ii) the Company would be permitted to make an Investment at the time of Designation (assuming the effectiveness of such Designation) pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted _Payments” above in an amount (the “Designation Amount”) equal to the greater of (1) the net_ book value of the Company’s interest in such Subsidiary calculated in accordance with IFRS or (2) the Fair Market Value of the Parent’s interest in such Subsidiary; (c) such Unrestricted Subsidiary does not own any Capital Stock of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company which is not simultaneously being designated an Unrestricted Subsidiary; and (d) such Unrestricted Subsidiary is not a party to any agreement, contract, arrangement or understanding at such time with the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary unless the terms of any such agreement, contract, arrangement or understanding are no less favorable to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary than those that might be obtained at the time from Persons who are not Affiliates of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or would be permitted to the extent described under “—Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates” or, in the event such condition is not satisfied, the value of such agreement, contract, arrangement or understanding to such Unrestricted Subsidiary shall be deemed a Restricted Payment. In the event of any such Designation, the Company will be deemed to have made an Investment constituting a Restricted Payment pursuant to the covenant “Limitation on Restricted Payments” for all purposes of the Indenture in the Designation Amount. The Indenture will also provide that the Company will not and will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary to at any time (a) provide a guarantee of, or similar credit support for, or subject any of its property or assets (other than the Capital Stock of any Unrestricted Subsidiary) to the satisfaction of, any Indebtedness of any Unrestricted Subsidiary (including any undertaking, agreement or instrument evidencing such Indebtedness) or (b) be directly or indirectly liable for any Indebtedness of any Unrestricted Subsidiary, except to the extent permitted under the covenant “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” For purposes of the foregoing, the Designation of a Subsidiary of the Company as an Unrestricted Subsidiary shall be deemed to be the Designation of all of the Subsidiaries of such Subsidiary as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. The Company may redesignate an Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary (a “Redesignation”) if: (a) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of and after giving effect to such Redesignation or would occur as a consequence of such Redesignation; (b) all Liens and Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary outstanding immediately following such Redesignation would, if incurred at such time, have been permitted to be incurred for all purposes of the Indenture; and (c) unless such redesignated Subsidiary shall not have any Indebtedness outstanding (other than Indebtedness that would be Permitted Indebtedness), immediately after giving effect to such proposed Redesignation, and after giving _pro forma effect to the incurrence of any such 204 ----- Indebtedness of such redesignated Subsidiary as if such Indebtedness was incurred on the date of the Redesignation, the Company could incur €1.00 of additional Indebtedness (other than Permitted Indebtedness) pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on _Indebtedness.”_ All Designations and Redesignations must be evidenced by a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company delivered to the Notes Trustee certifying compliance with the foregoing provisions. _Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_ If on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then, beginning on that day and continuing until such time, if any, at which the Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status, the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following captions will not apply to the Notes: “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on _Indebtedness,” “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments,” “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates,” “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sale of Assets,” “—Certain Covenants— Limitation on Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries,” the provisions of_ clause (c) of the covenant described under “—Consolidation, Merger, Sale of Assets—Issuer,” clause (c) of the covenant described under “—Consolidation, Merger, Sale of Assets—Company and the Parent” and clause (c) of the covenant described under “—Consolidation, Merger, Sale of Assets—Guarantors other than the Company and the _Parent” and any related default provisions of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable to_ the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries. Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the first day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to actions of the Company properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension Event, and the “Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant will be interpreted as if it had been in effect since the date of the Indenture except that no default will be deemed to have occurred solely by reason of a Restricted Payment made while that covenant was suspended. _Impairment of Security Interest_ The Parent, the Company and Tenderco will not, and the Company will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or knowingly or negligently omit to take, any action which action or omission might or would have the result of materially impairing the security interest with respect to the Collateral for the benefit of the Notes Trustee and the holders of the Notes, and the Parent, the Company and Tenderco will not, and the Company will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Trustee or Notes Trustee, for the benefit of the Notes Trustee and the holders of the Notes (other than Additional Notes) and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral, except as permitted in the Security Documents, but subject to the succeeding paragraph, the Parent, Tenderco, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may (i) incur Permitted Collateral Liens and (ii) implement any transaction permitted under the second paragraph under the caption “Consolidation, Merger, Sale of Assets—General.” The Indenture will provide that, at the direction of the Company and without the consent of the holders of the Notes, the Notes Trustee and the Security Trustee may from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the Security Documents to: (i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency therein or reflect changes of a minor, technical or administrative nature, (ii) provide for Permitted Collateral Liens, (iii) add to the Collateral, (iv) make any change necessary or desirable, in the good faith determination of the Board of Directors of the Company, in order to implement any transactions permitted under the second paragraph under the caption “Consolidation, Merger, Sale of Assets—General” or (v) make any other change thereto that does not adversely affect the holders of the Notes in any material respect; _provided,_ _however, that no Security Document may be amended and no waiver of any of the requirements of, or granting of any consent under, any Security Document may be made unless any such amendment, waiver or consent applies equally to the holders of all security granted under the Security Document. 205 ----- _Additional Intercreditor Agreements_ The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Company, at the time of, or prior to, the incurrence of any Indebtedness that is permitted to share the Collateral pursuant to the definition of Permitted Collateral Liens, the Issuer, each Guarantor, any other Restricted Subsidiary and the Notes Trustee and the Security Trustee are authorized (without any further consent of the holders of the Notes) to enter into an additional intercreditor agreement on terms substantially the same as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms more favorable to holders of the Notes) or an amendment to the Intercreditor Agreement to permit such Indebtedness to be subject to (and benefit from) substantially the same terms with respect to the release of the Collateral and Guarantees, enforcement of security interests, turnover, limitations on enforcement and other rights and limitations of the creditors of Senior Secured Indebtedness as contained in the Intercreditor Agreement in effect as of the Issue Date (or, in the case of any such terms, terms more favorable to the holders of the Notes). The Indenture will also provide that, at the direction of the Company and without the consent of the holders of the Notes, the Notes Trustee and the Security Trustee will upon direction of the Company from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement or any additional intercreditor agreement or deed to: (i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency therein; (ii) increase the amount of Indebtedness or the types covered thereby that may be incurred by the Company, a Restricted Subsidiary or the Parent that is subject thereto and to provide for Permitted Liens; (iii) add Guarantors or other parties (such as representatives of new issuances of Indebtedness) thereto; (iv) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes); (v) make provision for equal and ratable grants of Liens on the Collateral to secure Additional Notes or to implement any Permitted Collateral Liens; (vi) make any change necessary or desirable, in the good faith determination of the Board of Directors of the Company, in order to implement any transactions permitted under the second paragraph under the caption “Consolidation, Merger, Sale of Assets—General;” provided that such change does not adversely affect the rights of the holders of the Notes in any material respect or (vii) make any other such change thereto that does not adversely affect the rights of the holders of the Notes in any material respect.

Insolvency Regulation states that the “centre of main interests” of a debtor should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and “is therefore ascertainable by their parties.” In that respect, factors such as where board meetings are held, the location where the company conducts the majority of its business and the location where the large majority of the company’s creditors are established may all be relevant in the determination of the place where the company has its “centre of main interests.” The point at which a company’s “centre of main interests” is determined is at the time that the relevant insolvency proceedings are opened. If the centre of main interests of a company is and will remain located in the state in which it has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under the E.U. Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction, and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the E.U. Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State under the E.U. Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be opened in another Member State. If the “centre of main interests” of a debtor is in one Member State (other than Denmark) under Article 3(2) of the E.U. Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open “territorial proceedings” only in the event that such debtor has an “establishment” (in the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member State. The effects of those territorial proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State. If the company does not have an establishment in any other Member State, no court of any other Member State has jurisdiction to open territorial proceedings in respect of such company under the E.U. Insolvency Regulation. 266 -----",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

If the net assets of the debtor have fallen below 50% of the debtor’s registered capital, the continuity of the enterprise is always presumed to be at risk. As long as the court overseeing a judicial restructuring has not issued a ruling on the restructuring petition, the debtor cannot be declared bankrupt or wound up by court order. In addition, during the period between the filing of the petition and the court’s decision, none of the debtor’s assets may be disposed of by any of its creditors as a result of the enforcement of any security interests that such creditors may hold with respect to such assets. Within a period of ten days as from the filing of the petition and subject to the satisfaction of the filing conditions, the court will declare the judicial restructuring procedure open, allowing a temporary moratorium for a maximum period of six months. At the request of the debtor and pursuant to the report issued by the delegated judge, the moratorium period can be extended by six months. In exceptional circumstances (such as due to the size of the business, the complexity of the case or the impact of the procedure on employment), and in the interest of the creditors, the court may order an additional extension of the moratorium period for six months. The granting of the moratorium operates as a stay. No enforcement measures with respect to pre-existing claims in the moratorium can be continued or initiated against any of the debtor’s assets from the time that the moratorium is granted until the end of the period. During the duration of the moratorium, no attachments can be made with regard to pre-existing claims. Conservatory attachments that existed prior to the opening of the judicial restructuring retain their conservatory character, but the court may order their release, provided that such release does not have a material adverse effect on the situation of the creditor concerned. Receivables pledged by the debtor in favor of a creditor prior to the opening of the judicial restructuring procedure are not covered by the moratorium, and the holder of such pledged receivables is permitted to take enforcement measures against the estate of the initial counterparty of the debtor (e.g., the debtor’s customers) during the moratorium. A pledge on financial instruments or cash held on accounts in the meaning of the Financial Collateral Law of 15 December 2004 can be enforced notwithstanding the enforcement prohibition imposed by the moratorium. Personal guarantees granted by third parties in favor of the debtor’s creditors are not covered by the enforcement prohibition imposed by the moratorium, nor are the debts payable by co-debtors. The moratorium also does not prevent the voluntary payment by the debtor of claims covered by the moratorium. During the judicial restructuring procedure, the board of directors and management of the debtor continue to exercise their management functions. However, upon request of the debtor or any other interested party and to the extent it is deemed useful for reaching the aims of the restructuring, the court may appoint, in its decision to open 267 ----- the judicial restructuring procedure or at any other point in time during the course of the procedure, a judicial administrator (gerechtsmandataris/mandataire de justice) to assist the debtor during the restructuring. The restructuring procedure aims to preserve the continuity of a company as a going concern. Consequently, the initiation of the procedure does not terminate any contracts, and contractual provisions which provide for the early termination or acceleration of the contract upon the initiation or approval of a restructuring procedure, and certain contractual terms such as default interest, may not be enforceable during such a procedure. The Belgian law on judicial restructuring provides that a creditor may not terminate a contract on the basis of a debtor’s default that occurred prior to the restructuring procedure if the debtor remedies such default within a 15-day period following the notification of such default. As an exception to the general rule of continuity of contracts, the debtor may cease performing a contract during the restructuring procedure, provided that the debtor notifies the creditor, and the decision is necessary for the debtor to be able to propose a reorganization plan to its creditors or to transfer all or part of the company or its assets.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

In the case of a judicial restructuring by collective agreement, the creditors agree to a restructuring plan during the restructuring procedure. The plan must be filed with the Clerk’s Office of the Commercial Court at least 14 days in advance of the date on which the creditors will vote on the approval of the restructuring plan. The court needs to ratify the restructuring plan prior to its taking effect. Within a period of 14 days following the ruling declaring the judicial restructuring procedure open, the debtor must inform each of its creditors individually of the amount of its claims against the debtor as recorded in the books of the debtor, as well as of details regarding security interests, if applicable. Creditors with pre-existing claims, as well as any other interested party that claims to be a creditor, can challenge the amounts and the ranking of the secured claims declared by the debtor. The court can determine the disputed amounts and the ranking of such claims on a preliminary basis for the purpose of the restructuring procedure, or definitively, on the condition that it has jurisdiction in that respect, but that the decision relating to the dispute cannot be taken in a sufficiently short time frame.

The question of corporate benefit is determined on a case-by-case basis and consideration has to be given to any direct and/or indirect benefit that the company would derive from the transaction. Two principles apply to such evaluation: (i) the risk taken by the company in issuing the guarantee must be proportional to the direct and/or indirect benefit derived from the transaction and (ii) the financial support granted by the company should not exceed its financial capabilities. If the corporate benefit requirement is not met, the directors of the company may be held liable (i) by the company for negligence in the management of the company and (ii) by third parties in tort. Moreover, the guarantee or collateral could be declared null and void and, under certain circumstances, the creditor that benefits from the guarantee or collateral could be held liable for up to the amount of the guarantee. Alternatively, the guarantee or collateral could be reduced to an amount corresponding to the corporate benefit, or the creditor may be held liable for any guarantee amount in excess of such amount. These rules have been seldom tested under Belgian law, and there is only limited case law on this issue. In order to enable Belgian subsidiaries to grant a guarantee and collateral to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Belgian rules on corporate benefit, it is standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to contain so-called “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries incorporated or established in Belgium. Accordingly, the Purchase Agreement, the Indenture and the security documents will contain such limitation language and the security and the guarantees of the Belgian Guarantors will be so limited. The Indenture will expressly provide, substantially to the effect that, the obligations of each Belgian Guarantor under the guarantee clause of the Indenture: (a) shall not include any liability which would constitute unlawful financial assistance (as determined in article 329/430/629 of the Belgian Company Code); and (b) shall be limited to a maximum aggregate amount equal to the greater of (a) 90% of such Belgian Guarantor’s net assets (as defined in article 320/429/617 of the Belgian Company Code) as shown in its most recent audited annual financial statements as approved at its meeting of shareholders, and (b) the aggregate of the amounts, either directly or through one or more other companies of the INEOS Group, made available to such Belgian Guarantor and its subsidiaries (if any) using all 270 ----- or part of the proceeds of the notes (increased by all interests, commissions, costs, fees, expenses and other sums accruing or payable in connection with such amount).",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

The court issuing the bankruptcy order may determine, based on serious and objective indications, that the cessation of payments occurred on an earlier date. Such earlier date may not be earlier than six months before the date of the bankruptcy order, except in cases where the bankruptcy order relates to a company that was dissolved more than six months before the date of the bankruptcy order in circumstances suggesting an intent to defraud its creditors, in which case the date of cessation of payments may be determined as being the date of such decision to dissolve the company.

Conditions for a bankruptcy order (declaration de faillite/aangifte van faillissement) are that the debtor must be in a situation of cessation of payments (cessation de paiements/staking van betaling) and be unable to obtain further credit (ebranlement de credit/wiens krediet geschokt is). Cessation of payments is generally accepted to mean that the debtor is not able to pay its debts as they fall due. Such situation must be persistent and not merely 268 ----- temporary. In bankruptcy, the debtor loses all authority and decision rights concerning the management of the bankrupt business. The bankruptcy receiver (curateur/curator) becomes responsible for the operation of the business and implements the sale of the debtor’s assets, the distribution of the sale proceeds to creditors and the liquidation of the debtor. The rights of creditors in the process are limited to being informed of the course of the bankruptcy proceedings on a regular basis by the receiver. Creditors may oppose the sale of assets by bringing an action before the court, or may request the temporary continued operation of the business. The receiver must decide whether or not to continue performance under ongoing contracts (i.e., contracts existing before the bankruptcy order). The receiver may elect to continue the business of the debtor, provided the receiver obtains the authorization of the court and such continuation does not cause any prejudice to the creditors. However, two exceptions apply: (a) the parties to an agreement may contractually agree that the occurrence of a bankruptcy constitutes an automatic early termination or acceleration event; and (b) _intuitu personae contracts (i.e., contracts whereby the identity of the other party constitutes an essential element upon the signing of the contract) are automatically terminated as of the bankruptcy judgment, since the debtor is no longer responsible for the management of the company. Parties can agree to continue to perform under such contracts. The bankruptcy receiver may elect not to perform the obligations of the bankrupt party which are still to be performed after the bankruptcy under any agreement validly entered into by the bankrupt party prior to the bankruptcy if such decision is necessary for the management and liquidation of the bankrupt estate. The counterparty to that agreement may make a claim for damages in the bankruptcy (and such claim will rank _pari _passu with claims of all other unsecured creditors) and/or seek a court order to have the relevant contract dissolved._ The counterparty may not seek injunctive relief or require specific performance of the contract. The enforcement rights of individual creditors are suspended upon the rendering of the court order opening bankruptcy proceedings, and after such order is made, only the bankruptcy trustee may proceed against the debtor and liquidate its assets. However, such suspension does not apply to a pledge of financial instruments or cash held on account. For creditors with claims secured by movable assets, such suspension would normally be limited to the period required for the first report of verification of the claims. At the request of the bankruptcy receiver, the suspension period may be extended for up to one year from the bankruptcy judgment. Such extension requires a specific order of the court, which can only be made if the further suspension will allow for a realization of the assets in the interest of all creditors but without prejudicing the secured creditors, and provided that those secured creditors have been given the opportunity to be heard by the court. For creditors with claims secured by immovable assets, the intervention of the bankruptcy receiver is necessary to pursue the sale of the assets. The receiver will do so upon an order of the court, given either at its request or at the request of a mortgagee. A first-ranking mortgagee will generally be entitled to pursue the enforcement of its mortgage as soon as the first report of claims has been finalized; the court may suspend such enforcement for a period of not more than one year from the date of the bankruptcy if the suspension will allow for a realization of the assets without prejudicing the mortgagee, provided that the mortgagee has been given the opportunity to be heard by the court. However, a pledge on financial instruments or cash held on accounts can be enforced during the suspension period. As from the date of the bankruptcy judgment, no further interest accrues against the bankrupt debtor on its unsecured debt, or debts secured by a general privilege, like tax administration or social security. The debts of the bankrupt estate generally will be ranked as to priority on the basis of complex rules. The following is a general overview of such rules: 269 ----- (a) Estate debt: Costs and indebtedness incurred by the receiver during the bankruptcy proceedings, the so-called “estate debts”, have a senior priority. In addition, if the receiver has contributed to the realization and enforcement of secured assets, such costs will be paid to the receiver in priority out of the proceeds of the realized assets before distributing the remainder to the secured creditors; (b) Security interests: Creditors that hold a security interest have a priority right over the secured asset (whether by means of appropriation of the asset or on the proceeds upon realization); (c) Privileges: Creditors may have a particular privilege on certain or all assets (e.g., tax claims, claims for social security premiums, etc.). Privileges on specific assets rank before privileges on all assets of the debtor; and (d) _Pari passu: Once all estate debts and creditors having the benefit of security interests and privileges have been satisfied, the proceeds of the remaining assets will be distributed by the receiver among the unsecured creditors who rank _pari passu (unless a creditor agreed to be subordinated).",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

Bankruptcy and insolvency matters are within the jurisdiction of the federal government of Canada, but provincial laws can affect bankruptcy and insolvency proceedings relating to those entities. In the event of the insolvency of any Canadian Guarantor, insolvency proceedings with respect to that Canadian Guarantor may be initiated in Canada. Canadian insolvency laws and applicable provincial legislation would govern those proceedings (subject to laws or protocols that may be applicable to international insolvencies if proceedings also occur in other jurisdictions in respect of those Guarantors). The insolvency laws of Canada and related provincial legislation may restrict, delay or limit certain of your rights and remedies, including in respect of priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post-filing interest and other amounts and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and hence may limit your ability to recover payments due on the notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under insolvency laws of other jurisdictions. On September 18, 2009, significant amendments to Canadian insolvency law went into force, and apply to Canadian insolvency proceedings commenced on or after September 18, 2009. In Canada, there are two primary federal statutes that govern insolvency and restructuring proceedings of corporate debtors. The Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (the “BIA”) contains provisions for the liquidation of insolvent companies (in a manner loosely akin, in substance, to U.S. Chapter 7 proceedings, although there are important distinctions) and for the restructuring of corporations (in a manner loosely akin, in substance, to U.S. Chapter 11 proceedings, although there are important distinctions). Similar to bankruptcy proceedings in the U.S., a corporate debtor may be petitioned into bankruptcy (i.e., involuntary proceedings) or file for bankruptcy or reorganization (i.e., voluntary proceedings). In addition to the BIA, Canada also has the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (“CCAA”), which is a restructuring statute that operates, in practice, in a manner loosely akin to U.S. Chapter 11 proceedings (with important distinctions). CCAA proceedings are only available to insolvent debtor companies having debts in excess of CDN$5 million (or such other amount prescribed by regulation under the CCAA). Insolvency proceedings in Canada, whether under the BIA or the CCAA, are court-supervised. Upon the bankruptcy of a debtor corporation, whether voluntarily or upon the application of a creditor, the BIA imposes a stay of any action, execution or other proceeding by unsecured creditors in respect of the debtor, unless the creditors first obtain leave of the applicable court. In a liquidation (as opposed to restructuring) context, the stay of proceedings does not generally apply to secured creditors, who are free to exercise their rights of selfhelp or to otherwise realize on their security outside of the BIA. However, upon the application of the debtor, the court may, in exceptional cases, stay the rights of a secured creditor for up to six months. Upon becoming bankrupt, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, all of a debtor’s assets (subject to very limited exceptions) vest in a trustee in bankruptcy (subject to the rights of secured creditors with validly perfected security interests), at which point the debtor no longer has any ability to deal with those assets. The trustee typically proceeds to liquidate the assets and distribute the proceeds of the assets in accordance with the provisions of the BIA. The BIA sets out the priority scheme for the payment of claims against a bankrupt debtor, which priority scheme takes precedence over any operative priority scheme outside of bankruptcy. Subject to certain statutory priority claims enumerated in the BIA (including, without limitation, “super priority” charge under the BIA against a debtor’s current assets for employee wages of up to CDN$2,000 per employee, expenses up to 1,000 per employee and certain pension plan contribution) and true trust claims, secured creditors have the right to look first to the assets charged by their validly perfected security for payment. Thereafter, the BIA provides a list of preferred creditors who recover their debts in priority to the general body of unsecured creditors. Preferred claims are paid in full, in order of their ranking. before any payments to lower ranking preferred creditors or general unsecured creditors. All other claims will be considered general unsecured claims and rank pari passu. If there is any surplus after payment 272 ----- to the unsecured creditors, the balance will be used to pay interest from the date of the bankruptcy at 5% per annum on all claims proved in the bankruptcy according to their priority. Any remaining amount would then be available for shareholders. In the present instance, the proceeds resulting from the realization of the estate of an insolvent Canadian debtor that has guaranteed the notes may not be sufficient to satisfy secured claims or your deficiency claims as unsecured creditors under the guarantees granted by each Canadian Guarantor after the applicable Canadian Guarantor’s prior-ranking secured creditors and other claims that rank in priority to claims of holders of notes have been satisfied. Corporate restructurings in Canada may be implemented under either the BIA or the CCAA, with the latter being more commonly used by larger corporations. In either case, a broad stay of creditors’ rights and enforcement proceedings is generally implemented (in the case of the BIA by a statutory stay, and in the case of the CCAA by a court-ordered stay). The stay generally applies to secured creditors, subject to certain limited exceptions. Under this court-ordered protection, the debtor will typically formulate a restructuring proposal or plan or conduct an orderly wind-down or a sale as a going concern. In the event of a restructuring proposal or plan, a double majority of the creditors (i.e., a simple majority in number having two-thirds in value of the claims in question) present and voting either in person or by proxy at a meeting of creditors for each designated class must approve the proposal or plan, and the proposal or plan must be sanctioned by the court. Secured creditors may be included in such a proposal or plan (in which case they may have a right to vote in a separate class) or may be dealt with outside of the proposal or plan. In the event of a liquidation, proceeds are generally distributed in accordance with the priority established by statute and the court (which may differ in some respects from those in a bankruptcy under the BIA). The court may also authorize the creation of priority charges ranking ahead of other creditors in both CCAA and BIA restructurings (for example, for DIP financings, directors’ and officers’ indemnification and administration costs). In the present instance, the proposed treatment of secured and unsecured creditors under the guarantee granted by the Canadian Guarantors in a restructuring proposal or plan is generally at the discretion of the Canadian Guarantors, subject to the rights of creditors affected by the proposal or plan to vote on such proposal or plan. Where a debtor deals with his property in a manner that prejudices its creditors (particularly where such debtor is or becomes thereafter insolvent), such transactions by the debtor may be subject to challenge by creditors and the scrutiny of the court. Under Canadian federal and provincial law, there are a number of statutory means to challenge or avoid such transactions. Where a transaction subject to review is held to be contrary to Canadian law, the transaction is subject to be impugned and a wide variety of possible remedies may be imposed. Should the Canadian Guarantors become insolvent within applicable time periods, the granting of the guarantees, and the grant of security in connection therewith, could be subject to challenge and the guarantees and security potentially avoided, and any amounts obtained under the guarantee or security in support thereof that is avoided would have to be repaid. Should the holders of the notes be repaid or otherwise recover from the Canadian Guarantors at a time when such Guarantors are insolvent, or if the Canadian Guarantors thereafter become insolvent within applicable time periods, the repayment or recovery may be subject to challenge. Secured creditors may enforce their security by applying to the court for the appointment of a receiver or a receiver/manager. Where the debtor is insolvent, the conduct of the receivership will be governed by provincial law and the relevant provisions of the BIA and will be under the supervision of the Court.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

Under English law there is a possibility that a court could find that the fixed security interests expressed to be created by a security document could take effect as floating charges because the description given to them as fixed charges is not determinative. Whether fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed interests rather than floating security interest will depend, among other things, on whether the chargee has the requisite degree of control over the relevant chargor’s ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the chargee in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the secured assets without the consent of the chargee, the court is likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

An administrator can also be appointed out of court by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge and different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointor. During the administration, in general no proceedings or other legal process may be commenced or continued against the debtor, or security enforced over the company’s property, except with leave of the court or the consent of the administrator. Certain creditors of a company in administration may be able to realize their security over that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to a “security financial collateral agreement” (generally, cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradable capital market debt instruments) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003. If an English Obligor were to enter administration, it is possible that the security granted by it or the guarantee granted by it may not be enforced while it is in administration. In addition, other than in limited circumstances, no administrative receiver can be appointed by a secured creditor in preference to an administrator, and any already appointed must resign if requested to do so by the administrator. Where the company is already in administration no other receiver may be appointed. In order to empower the Security Trustee to appoint an administrative receiver or an administrator to the company, the floating charge granted by the relevant English Obligor must constitute a “qualifying floating charge” for purposes of English insolvency law and, in the case of the ability to appoint an administrative receiver, the qualifying floating charge must, unless the security document pre-dates September 15, 2003, fall within one of the exceptions in the Enterprise Act 2002 to the prohibition on the appointment of administrative receivers. In order to 274 ----- constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which (a) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it; (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by Section 29(2) of the U.K. Insolvency Act 1986. The Security Trustee will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if such floating charge security, together (if necessary) with the fixed charge security interests, relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the relevant English Obligor’s property and at least one such security interest is a qualifying floating charge. The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception relating to “capital market arrangements” (as defined in the U.K. Insolvency Act 1986, as amended), which will apply if the issuer of the notes creates a debt of at least £50,000,000 for the relevant company during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital markets investment” (which is defined in the U.K. Insolvency Act 1986, as amended, but is generally a rated, listed or traded debt instrument). An administrator, receiver (including administrative receiver) or liquidator of the company will be required to ringfence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security for the benefit of unsecured creditors. Under current law, this applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of floating charge realizations and 20% of the remainder over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of £600,000. Whether the assets that are subject to the floating charges and other security will constitute substantially the whole of the relevant English Obligor’s assets at the time that the floating charges are enforced will be a question of fact at that time. In addition, under English insolvency law any debt payable in a currency other than pounds sterling (such as euro or U.S. dollars in the case of the notes) must be converted into pounds sterling at the “official exchange rate” prevailing at the date when the debtor went into liquidation or administration. This provision overrides any agreement between the parties. The “official exchange rate” for these purposes is the middle market rate at the London Foreign Exchange Market at close of business as published for the date in question or, if no such rate is published, such rate as the court determines. Accordingly, in the event that an English Obligor goes into liquidation or administration, holders of the notes may be subject to exchange rate risk between the date that such English Obligor went into liquidation or administration and receipt of any amounts to which such holders of the notes may become entitled. There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English company of security and guarantees can be challenged. In most cases this will only arise if the company is placed into administration or liquidation within a specified period (as set out in more detail below) of the granting of the guarantee or security. Therefore, if during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is appointed to an English company, he may challenge the validity of the guarantee or security given by such company.

It will only be a transaction at an undervalue if at the time of the transaction or as a result of the transaction, the English company is insolvent (as defined in the U.K. Insolvency Act 1986, as amended). The transaction can be challenged if the English company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of two years from the date the English company grants the security interest or the guarantee. A transaction might be subject to being set aside as a transaction at an undervalue if the company makes a gift to a person, if the company receives no consideration or if the company receives consideration of significantly less value, in money or money’s worth, than the consideration given by such company.

If the court determines that the transaction was a preference, the court has very wide powers for restoring the position to what it would have been if that preference had not been given, which could include reducing payments under the notes and the guarantees (although there is protection for a third party who enters into one of the transactions in good faith and without notice). However, for the court to determine a preference, it must be shown that the English company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect.

It is available only at the request of a debtor company. The debtor must be solvent (i.e. not unable to pay its due debts out of its available assets) but experiencing difficulties that cannot be overcome. The safeguard proceedings are public and include an automatic stay of all actions against the debtor for up to six months, renewable for an additional six months with court approval and which can be extended to a maximum of 18 months upon request of the public prosecutor. During the safeguard procedure, payments by the debtor of any debts incurred prior to the opening of the procedure are prohibited, subject to limited exceptions. The bankruptcy judge can authorize payments for prior debts in order to discharge a lien on property needed for the continued operation of the business or get back goods or rights transferred as collateral in a fiduciary estate (patrimoine fiduciaire). Debts arising after the commencement of the safeguard procedure will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the safeguard procedure if they relate to expenses necessary for the business’s ordinary activities or are for the requirements of the procedure. One of the main features of the safeguard procedure consists in the creation of two creditors’committees (mandatory for companies employing more than 150 persons or with a turnover exceeding twenty million euros, optional below such 277 ----- thresholds), one consisting of banks and financial institutions and the other of trade creditors, and a general meeting of noteholders in the event the concerned debtor would have issued bonds, to which the debtor submits proposals to reach agreement on a recovery plan. The committees must accept or reject proposals for a plan within a minimum of 15 days of such proposals. The plan is approved where members of each committee voting in favor of the plan account for at least two-thirds of the outstanding claims of the creditors expressing a vote. In cases where bonds have been issued by the concerned French company, the plan, if approved by the committees, is then submitted to the general meeting of noteholders (majority of two-thirds of the outstanding claims of the noteholders expressing a vote). The committees and the general meeting of noteholders, if any, shall vote on the plan within 6 months from the date of the judgment opening the procedure. The plan submitted to the committees and the noteholders, if any, may include rescheduling of debts but also cancellation of debts and debt-for equity swaps. Following approval by the creditors’ committees and the general meeting of noteholders, if any, and subject to verification by the court that creditors’ interests are adequately preserved, the court can approve the plan, in which case the plan will be binding on dissenting members of the committees and the general assembly of noteholders (if any) though not on creditors who are not members of one of the committees and who are not noteholders. Creditors who are not members of committees and who are not noteholders are consulted on an individual basis. For those individual creditors who have not reached a negotiated agreement, the court can reschedule repayment of their claims over a maximum period of 10 years, except for debts with maturity dates of more than 10 years, in which case the maturity date may remain the same. The court cannot oblige such creditors to waive part of their claim. The first payment must be made within a year of the judgment adopting the plan (in the third and subsequent years, the amount of each annual installment must be of at least 5% of the total admitted pre-filing liabilities). The court can also impose a plan if one or both of the committees, or the general meeting of noteholders, does not approve the debtor company’s proposed plan, either by failing to vote within the specified 6-month period or by rejecting the plan. In such a case, the rules are the same as the one applicable to creditors who are not members of the committees and who are not noteholders (in particular, the court can only impose a rescheduling of the repayment of the debts over a maximum period of 10 years, except for debts with maturity dates of more than 10 years, in which case the maturity date may remain the same).",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

Consequently, in the event of an insolvency of any such Guarantor, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Germany. Such proceedings would then be governed by German law. However, pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a German company conducts business in more than one member state of the European Union, the jurisdiction of the German courts may be limited if the company’s “centre of main interests” is found to be in a member state other than Germany (see—“European Union”). There are a number of factors that are taken into account to ascertain the “centre of main interests”, which should correspond to the place where the company conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and is therefore ascertainable by third parties. The point at which this issue falls to be determined is at the time that the relevant insolvency proceedings are opened. Under German law, insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event of over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) or illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) of the debtor. The debtor is overindebted if its liabilities exceed the value of its assets (according to temporary legislation being in force until the end of 2013, the debtor is not considered over-indebted if its continuation as a going concern is highly likely). The debtor is illiquid if it is unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due. In addition, the debtor can file for insolvency proceedings if it is imminently at risk to be unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due (drohende _Zahlungsunfähigkeit). The insolvency proceedings are court controlled, and the court opens the insolvency_ proceedings if certain formal requirements are met and if there are sufficient assets to cover at least the costs of the proceedings. If insolvency proceedings are opened, the court appoints an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) who has full power to manage the business and dispose of the debtor’s assets, whereas the debtor is no longer entitled to manage the business or dispose of its assets. The insolvency administrator may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s operations, and satisfaction of these 280 ----- liabilities as preferential debts of the estate (Masseschulden) will be preferred to any insolvency liabilities created by the debtor (including secured debt). All creditors, whether secured or unsecured, who wish to assert claims against the debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings. Any individual enforcement action brought against the debtor by any of its creditors is subject to an automatic stay once insolvency proceedings have been opened. Secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce their security interests outside the insolvency proceedings. However, secured creditors have certain preferential rights. The enforcement proceeds minus certain contributory charges for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets and (ii) realizing the secured assets are paid to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. Remaining amounts are distributed among the unsecured creditors. If the German Guarantors grant security over their assets to other creditors than the holders of the notes, such security may result in a preferred treatment of creditors secured by such security. The proceeds resulting from such collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the holders of the notes under the guarantees granted by the German Guarantors after such secured creditors have been satisfied. A different distribution of enforcement proceeds can be proposed in an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) that can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and requires the consent of the debtor as well as the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules. Under German insolvency law, there is no consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency. In case of a group of companies, each entity, from an insolvency law point of view, has to be dealt with separately (i.e., there is no group insolvency concept under German insolvency law). As a consequence, there is, in particular, no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, but rather claims of and vis-à-vis each entity have to be dealt with separately.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

KG, a limited partnership with a GmbH (Limited Liability Company) as its sole general partner. Consequently, the grant of collateral by these Guarantors is subject to certain provisions of the GmbH-Gesetz (Limited Liability Company Act). Sections 30 and 31 of the GmbH-Gesetz (“Sections 30 and 31”) prohibit a GmbH from disbursing its assets to its shareholders to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s net assets (i.e., assets minus liabilities and liability reserves) is or would fall below the amount of its stated share capital. Guarantees, share pledges and any other collateral granted by a GmbH in order to guarantee or secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company are considered disbursements under Sections 30 and 31. Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to grant collateral to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Sections 30 and 31, it is standard market practice for credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to contain so-called “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries in the legal form of a GmbH or a limited partnership with a GmbH as its sole general partner incorporated or established in Germany. Pursuant to such limitation language, the secured parties agree to enforce the collateral and the beneficiaries of the guarantees agree to enforce the guarantees against the German subsidiary only to the extent that such enforcement does not result in the subsidiary’s net assets falling below its stated share capital. Accordingly, the documentation in relation to the guarantees and the security interests, to the extent they concern the German Guarantors, contains such limitation language and such guarantees and security interests are limited in the manner described. In addition to the limitations resulting from the capital maintenance rules, the guarantees and most of the security interests granted by the German subsidiaries of the Issuer will contain additional provisions limiting the enforcement in the event the enforcement would result in an illiquidity of the relevant German subsidiary. German capital maintenance rules are subject to ongoing court decisions. We can not assure you that future court rulings may not further limit the access of shareholders to assets of its subsidiaries constituted in the form of a limited liability company or of a limited partnership, the general partner or general partners of which is or are a limited liability company, which can negatively affect the ability of the Issuer to make payment on the notes, of the 281 ----- subsidiaries to make payments on the guarantees, of the secured parties to enforce the collateral or of the beneficiaries of the guarantees to enforce the guarantees. Under German law it is unclear whether all of the security interests in the Collateral give the Security Trustee a right to prevent other creditors of the German Guarantors from foreclosing into and realizing the Collateral. Some courts have held that certain types of security interests only give their holders priority (according to their rank) in the distribution of any proceeds of such realization. Accordingly, the Security Trustee and the noteholders may not be able to avoid foreclosure by unsecured creditors into the Collateral, even if they consider such foreclosure untimely.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

Based on these rules, an insolvency administrator may challenge transactions that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and were effected prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings. Such transactions can include the payment of any amounts to the holders of the notes as well as granting them any security interest. The administrator’s right to challenge transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions during the ten-year period prior to the filing of the petition for commencement of insolvency proceedings. In the event such a transaction is successfully avoided, the holders of the notes would be under an obligation to repay the amounts received or to waive the guarantee or security interest. In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which term includes the provision of security or the repayment of debt) may be avoided in the following cases: - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction (i) if such act was performed during the last three months prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of the insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) at the time when such act was taken and the creditor had knowledge of such illiquidity at such time, or (ii) if such act was performed after the filing of the petition for the commencement of the insolvency proceedings and the creditor had knowledge of the illiquidity of the debtor or the filing of such petition; - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction to which such creditor was not entitled or which was granted or obtained in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was not entitled to such security or satisfaction if (i) such act was performed during the last month prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of the insolvency proceedings or after such filing, (ii) such act was performed during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was illiquid at such time, or (iii) such act was performed during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of 282 ----- the insolvency proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such act was detrimental to the other insolvency creditors; - any transaction by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors if (i) it was entered into during the three months prior to the filing of the petition of the commencement of the insolvency proceedings, the debtor was illiquid at the time of such transaction and the counterparty to such transaction had knowledge of the illiquidity at such time or (ii) it was entered into after such filing and the counterparty to such transaction had knowledge of either the debtor’s illiquidity or such filing at the time of the transaction; - any act whereby a debtor grants security for a third-party debt, which might be regarded as having been granted gratuitously (unentgeltlich), if it was effected in the four years prior to the filing of a petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings against the debtor; - any act performed by the debtor during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings with the intent to prejudice the insolvency creditors and the other party knew of such intention at the time of such act; - any act that provides security or satisfaction for a shareholder loan made to the debtor or a similar claim if (i) in the case of the provision of security, the act occurred during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of the insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition, or (ii), in the case of satisfaction, the act occurred during the last year prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of the insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition; and - any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to a third party if (i) the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for commencement of insolvency proceedings or thereafter and (ii) a shareholder of the debtor had granted security or was liable as a Guarantor (Bürge) (in which case the shareholder has to compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)). If any of the guarantees given or any security interest granted by any of the German Guarantors were avoided or held unenforceable for any reason, you would cease to have any claim in respect thereof. Any amounts received from a transaction that has been avoided would have to be repaid to the insolvent estate. Furthermore, even in the absence of an insolvency proceeding, a third-party creditor who has obtained an enforcement order but has failed to obtain satisfaction or its enforceable claims by a levy of execution, under certain circumstances, has the right to avoid certain transactions, such as the payment of debt and the granting of security pursuant to the German Code on Avoidance (Anfechtungsgesetz).",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

Accordingly, the Courts of Jersey may not recognize the powers of an administrator, administrative receiver or other receiver appointed in respect of Jersey situs assets. However, under Article 49(1) of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law, the Jersey court may assist the courts of prescribed countries and territories in all matters relating to the insolvency of any person to the extent that the Jersey court thinks fit. These prescribed jurisdictions include the United Kingdom. Further, in doing so, the Royal Court may have regard to the UNCITRAL model law, even though the model law has not been (and is unlikely to be) implemented as a separate law in Jersey. If the request comes from a prescribed country but not by a court-made request or from a non-prescribed country, then common law and principles of comity will be considered by the Royal Court by virtue of its inherent jurisdiction. If insolvency proceedings are afoot in another jurisdiction in relation to the company, the nature and extent of the cooperation from Jersey is likely to depend on the nature of the requesting country’s insolvency regime. If the requesting country adheres to principals of territoriality, as opposed to universality, and, for instance, ring-fences assets for local creditors, full cooperation is highly unlikely. If, however, the jurisdiction applies similar fundamental principles as Jersey the Royal Court’s approach is more likely to be similar to the position where prescribed countries are involved. In the case of both statutory and non-statutory requests for assistance, it should not be assumed that the UNCITRAL provisions will automatically be followed. That is a matter for the discretion of the Royal Court. It would also be wrong to assume for European countries that the position will be in accordance with EU Insolvency Regulation. Jersey does not form part of the European Community for the purposes of implementation of its directions. Accordingly, the EU Insolvency Regulation does not apply as a matter of Jersey domestic law and the automatic test of centre of main interests does not apply as a result.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

Consequently, in the event of an insolvency of any of the Malta Guarantors, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Malta. Such proceedings would then be governed by Maltese law. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Maltese insolvency law. 290 ----- In general once insolvency proceedings are set in motion, a creditor will be precluded from pursuing his claim other than through the winding up process. When insolvency sets in, by law any benefit of time which may have been afforded to the debtor/borrower for the performance of obligations or the repayment of a loan, ceases and thus the obligations of the debtor accelerate in terms of law. Under the Companies Act, Cap 386 of the laws of Malta, the causes of dissolution can be divided into 3 main categories: those situations under which the company is voluntarily dissolved and consequently wound up, those situations where the company _may be dissolved and wound up by the Court and those situations where the company shall be dissolved by the Court. For a Maltese company to be considered insolvent it must satisfy either of the following tests (a) if a debt due by the company has remained unsatisfied in whole or in part after twenty-four weeks from the enforcement of an executive title against the company by any of the executive acts in terms of the Code of Organization and Civil Procedure, Cap 12 of the laws of Malta; or (b) if it is proved to the satisfaction of the Court that the company is unable to pay its debts, account being taken also of contingent and prospective liabilities of the company. Obviously, if both tests are satisfied then it should be clearer for the Court that there is an impellent need for winding up. However, it is enough for a Maltese company to satisfy just one of these two tests outlined below in order for it to be considered insolvent.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

An application to the Court to order the winding up of a Maltese company may be presented by the company itself (acting in the General Meeting), the directors, any creditor or creditors, any debenture holder, any one or more of the company’s creditors’ or contributories, the Official Receiver or the Registrar of Companies. The Court has wide powers on the hearing of a petition. It may dismiss the application or make an order acceding thereto (this is referred to as a “winding up order”) and make such other orders including provisional orders and adjourn the hearing conditionally or otherwise as it thinks fit. The consequences of a winding up order are: (1) any disposal of the Maltese company’s property, any transfer of shares, and any alteration in the status of members of the company made after the date of its deemed dissolution, is void, unless the Court orders otherwise; (2) any act or warrant, whether precautionary or executive, other than a warrant of prohibitory injunction, issued or carried into effect against the Maltese company after the date of its deemed date of dissolution, is void; (3) a copy of the winding up order must be forwarded by the Registrar of Courts to the Registrar of Companies for registration; (4) judicial actions against the Maltese company are stayed, unless the Court orders otherwise; (5) on a winding up order being made, the Official Receiver becomes the liquidator and he continues to act until another person becomes liquidator; and (6) on a winding up order being made, the powers of the directors cease and are assumed by the liquidator. Immediately after a winding up order is made, the Official Receiver is appointed by the Court to act as a liquidator for the Maltese company until the appointment of a liquidator by the creditors. The Official Receiver also acts as liquidator for the Maltese company during any vacancy. 291 ----- The Official Receiver’s primary role at the initial stage of the winding up is to decide whether to summon meetings of the company’s creditors and contributories so that they may resolve whether one or more persons shall be appointed as liquidator/s in place of the Official Receiver; and whether to constitute a liquidation committee to supervise the liquidator’s conduct. Secondly, the Official Receiver is obliged to investigate the causes of the company’s insolvency or its failure to pay its debts. Furthermore, the Official Receiver shall also investigate the promotion, formation, business dealings, and affairs of the company, and make a report/s to the Court as he may deem fit. Once a liquidator is appointed, such liquidator is in fact bound to give to the Official Receiver such information and such access to and facilities for inspecting the accounts, accounting records and documents of the company and generally, such aid as may be requisite for enabling the Official Receiver to perform his duties under the Companies Act, 1995, Cap 386 of the laws of Malta.

The law stipulates that: (a) a Maltese company enters into a transaction at an undervalue if: (i) the company makes a gift or otherwise enters into a transaction on terms that provide for the company to receive no consideration; or (ii) the company enters into a transaction for a consideration the value of which, in money or money’s worth, is significantly less than the value in money or money’s worth of the consideration provided by the company; (b) a company gives a preference to a person if: (i) that person is one of the company’s creditors or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or other liabilities; and (ii) the company does anything or suffers anything to be done which, in either case, has the effect of putting that person into a position which, in the event of the company going into insolvent winding-up, will be better than the position he would have been had that act or omission not occurred. 292 ----- There is also another general rule found in the Civil Code, Cap 16 of the Laws of Malta, which may be applicable.

As a result, the borrower and the guarantors are jointly and severally liable to make payments in terms of the agreements. When debtors are jointly and severally liable they are all bound for the same obligation in such a way that each of them may be compelled to discharge the whole debt, and the payment made by one of them operates so as to release the others as against the creditor. In terms of the Civil Code, this kind of guarantee is regulated by the institute of ‘suretyship’ and a guarantor is known as a surety. A number of provisions relating to suretyship are of direct relevance to us, including that: (i) a suretyship can only exist in respect of a valid obligation; (ii) a suretyship which exceeds the debt or is contracted under more onerous conditions shall only be valid to the extent of the principal obligation; (iii) a surety who has paid the principal debt succeeds ipso jure to all the rights which the creditor had against the debtor; (iv) a surety may set up against the creditor all the pleas which appertain to the principal debtor and which are inherent in the debt; (v) a surety, even if jointly and severally bound, is released if the subrogation to the rights, hypothecs and privileges of the creditor cannot take place in his favor owing to the creditor’s fault; and (vi) if the creditor releases one of his sureties without the consent of the other sureties, such release operates also in favor of the other sureties to the extent of the share of the surety so released. Of the above, the most important provisions to keep in mind is that under the laws of Malta, guarantees and pledges are accessory to the principal obligation they secure and consequently, should the principal obligation being secured be null, the guarantees and pledges would also be null. This rule that a surety cannot be liable for more than the principal debtor is likely to be treated as a rule of public policy by Maltese courts.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

The key features of the Norwegian bankruptcy proceedings are (i) the seizure and subsequent disposal of debtor’s assets, (ii) assessment and ranking of claims, (iii) testing and revocation of transactions (including securing of existing claims) made prior to bankruptcy, (iv) handling of the debtor’s contractual relationships and (v) distribution of funds (if any) in accordance with the priority rules. If the business operations of the bankrupt company are continued, they are in practice continued at the risk of, and only to the extent guaranteed by, the creditors. Bankruptcy proceedings may be opened provided that the debtor is insolvent. Both the debtor and the creditors (holding or pretending to hold a claim) can petition for bankruptcy. 293 ----- There are two requirements for a debtor to be deemed to be insolvent. The debtor must (i) be unable to service its debt as it becomes due (the “cash flow test”), and (ii) the debtor must be in “deficit” (the company’s debts must exceed the sum of its assets and revenues) (the “balance sheet test”). During bankruptcy proceedings the debtor’s assets are controlled by the court appointed liquidator (generally a lawyer), on behalf of the bankruptcy estate. The main task of the liquidator is to turn all the debtor’s assets into cash in the manner assumed to be most profitable for the estate (the creditors), and then distribute the available cash to the rightful creditors. All the debtor’s assets will in practice be seized by the bankruptcy estate, and the debtor may not dispose of the seized assets in any way while the bankruptcy proceedings are ongoing. The bankruptcy estate may also seize assets held by third parties, if these assets are acquired from the debtor in an unlawful manner, or if the acquisition lacks legal protection, or if the transaction can be reversed according to the Recovery Act. The bankruptcy estate is a separate legal entity, which is authorized to exercise all ownership interests/rights with respect to the seized assets, including but not limited to the realization of assets. Secured creditors are, in principle, not deemed to be part of the bankruptcy proceedings to the extent the value of the security is sufficient to cover the underlying obligations of the debtor. The secured creditors may, in principle, realize the security and cover their claims, however, keeping in mind that the realization of a number of categories of security the first six months after the opening of a bankruptcy will be subject to the approval of the bankruptcy estate (the same principles apply to official debt negotiations). The bankruptcy estate may, subject to certain conditions being fulfilled, also decide to realize the security and divide the proceeds between the secured creditors and others holding legal rights in the assets. Any under-secured amount (any amount exceeding the value of the secured assets) will be deemed as an ordinary (unsecured) trade claim. In a Norwegian bankruptcy, the creditors will be paid according to the following priority: - Secured claims (valid and perfected security covered up to the value of the secured asset—either after the realization by the secured creditor itself or after realization undertaken by the bankruptcy estate). - Super priority claims (claims which arise during the bankruptcy proceedings, liquidator’s costs, obligations of the estate). - Salary claims (within certain limitations). - Tax claims (such as withholding tax and value-added tax within certain limitations). - Ordinary unsecured claims (all other claims unless subordinated, including unsecured debt, trade creditors and indemnity claims). - Subordinated claims (including interest incurred after the opening of bankruptcy proceedings, claims subordinated by agreement, liquidated damages and penalty claims). Pursuant to the Recovery Act, the bankruptcy estate may be entitled to set aside or reverse transactions carried out in the three up to twelve month period (and in respect of transactions in favor of related parties up to two years) before the opening of the bankruptcy, such as extraordinary payments of certain creditors, security established for old debt and transaction at under-value. The bankruptcy estate may also, under certain circumstances, be entitled to set aside or reverse transactions made in bad faith or negligently which in an improper manner increase the debtor’s debt, favor one creditor at the expense of others or deprive the debtor of assets which may otherwise have served to cover the creditors’ claims, in which case the time limit for challenges by the estate is increased to ten years. 294 ----- It should also be noted that the bankruptcy estate has a statutory first lien of up to five per cent of the respective asset’s estimated value or sales value over assets mortgaged/pledged by the debtor or mortgaged/pledged by a third party for the debtor’s indebtedness (limited however to the Norwegian Court Fee (presently being in the amount of 860 Norwegian krone) multiplied by 700 for assets registered in an asset register (“realregister”)). Such statutory lien is not applicable to financial security pursuant to the Norwegian Financial Security Act no. 17/2004 (cash deposits and financial instruments), cf. the Norwegian Liens Act no. 2/1980 section 6-4 (9).",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

The above restriction does not, however, apply to credit or security/guarantee for the obligations of a parent company or another company within the same “group.” This exemption must be read in conjunction with the group definition in Section 1-3 of the Norwegian Companies Act which, broadly speaking, includes Norwegian limited liability companies. The group exemption is, according to Section 1-4 of the Norwegian Companies Act, extended to limited liability companies established within the European Economic Area, but only to the extent such European Economic Area group companies are subject to laws that are correspondent to or more stringent than the Norwegian rules with respect to lending to, guaranteeing or providing security for the obligations of shareholders or a related party (a qualification which is difficult to apply in practice). Without having made a comparative analysis between Norwegian and English law on those issues, it should be deemed that a PLC company or a limited company subject to English law is not regarded as subject to laws that are equivalent to or more stringent than the Norwegian rules in this respect. In addition to the restrictions with regard to, among others, upstream and cross-stream guarantees and security as outlined above, Section 8-10 of the Norwegian Companies Act prohibits a Norwegian private or public limited liability company from providing financial assistance in connection with the acquisition of its shares or the shares in the parent company. The prohibition against financial assistance applies irrespective of whether the company in which shares are acquired is a Norwegian or foreign company, and there are no general exemptions available. The assistance is prohibited if made “in connection with” the acquisition of the shares, which may also cover financial assistance after completion of the acquisition, for instance by way of a refinancing of acquisition debt. A loan, guarantee or security interest infringing the limitations set out in Section 8-7 and Section 8-10 of the Norwegian Companies Act is void and any funds paid out will have to be repaid. In addition, loans, securities and guarantees of Guarantors incorporated in Norway may be deemed void for failing to comply with the provisions in Chapter 3 of the Norwegian Companies Act. The principle of corporate benefit also exists in Norway and may in some situations impose a restriction on a Norwegian company’s ability to offer credits or a guarantee and provide security to shareholders (or close associates of the shareholders) in addition to the restrictions on financial assistance and upstream/cross-stream guarantees and security described above. Accordingly, any guarantees and security for the notes provided by Guarantors incorporated in Norway may be void under Norwegian law as infringing one or more of the above limitations.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

Only creditors of a claim may have active judicial standing in a Norwegian court, therefore, a security agent may seek enforcement of a claim but such claim may have to be supported by the actual creditors of such claim.

In Scotland, forms of security are closely tied to specific types of property. Since Scots law does not recognize the English law concept of ‘equity’ there is more focus on the legal formalities rather than the intention of the parties with respect to the creation of security interests. If the strict legal requirements under Scots law are not met, there will be no security over the subject notwithstanding the intention of the parties. 296 ----- In respect of movable property, it is essential that the security holder has some form of possession (which may take different forms) over the subject in order to create a valid security interest. Scots law does not differentiate between legal and equitable ownership of property so, for instance, in order to create a security interest over shares in companies incorporated in Scotland, the security holder (or its nominee) must be registered as the shareholder. Furthermore, there is no Scottish equivalent of an English law of equitable assignment, a Scottish interest in incorporeal property will only be created when the assignation is notified to the relevant parties. Fixed charges over land and buildings situated in Scotland may only be created using a standard security (which is the English law equivalent of a legal mortgage over an interest of land) and is governed by statute.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

An administrator can also be appointed out of court by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge and different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointor. During the administration, in general no proceedings or other legal process may be commenced or continued against the debtor, or security enforced over the company’s property, except with leave of the court or the consent of the administrator. Certain creditors of a company in administration may be able to realize their security over that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to a “security financial collateral agreement” (generally, cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradable capital market debt instruments) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003. If the Scottish Guarantor were to enter administration, it is possible that the security granted by it or the guarantee granted by it may not be enforced while it is in administration. In addition, other than in limited circumstances, no administrative receiver can be appointed by a secured creditor in preference to an administrator, and any already appointed must resign if requested to do so by the administrator. Where the company is already in administration no other receiver may be appointed. In order to empower the Security Trustee to appoint an administrative receiver or an administrator to the company, the floating charge granted by the relevant Scottish Guarantor must constitute a “qualifying floating charge” for purposes of Scottish insolvency law and, in the case of the ability to appoint an administrative receiver, the qualifying floating charge must, unless the security document pre-dates September 15, 2003, fall within one of the exceptions in the Enterprise Act 2002 to the prohibition on the appointment of administrative receivers. In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which (a) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it; (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company; (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver; or (d) purports to empower the holder of a floating charge in Scotland to appoint a receiver who on appointment would be an administrative receiver (although this is only permitted under limited circumstances). The Security Trustee will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if such floating charge security, together (if necessary) with the fixed charge security interests, relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the Scottish Guarantor’s property and at least one such security interest is a qualifying floating charge. The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception relating to “capital market arrangements” (as defined in the U.K. Insolvency Act 1986, as amended), which will apply if the issue of the notes creates a debt of at least £50,000,000 for the relevant company during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital markets investment” (which is defined in the U.K. Insolvency Act 1986, but is generally a rated, listed or traded debt instrument). An administrator, receiver or liquidator of the company will be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security for the benefit of unsecured creditors. Under current law, this applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of net floating charge realizations and 20% of the remainder over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of £600,000. Whether the assets that are subject to the floating charges and other security will constitute substantially the whole of the Scottish Guarantor’s assets at the time that the floating charges are enforced will be a question of fact at that time. In addition, under Scottish insolvency law any debt payable in a currency other than pounds sterling (such as euro or U.S. dollars in the case of the notes) must be converted into pounds sterling at the rate of exchange for that currency at the mean of the buying and selling spot rates prevailing in the London market at close of business on the date of commencement of winding up. Accordingly, in the event that the Scottish Guarantor goes into liquidation 297 ----- or administration, holders of the notes may be subject to exchange rate risk between the date that went into liquidation or administration and receipt of any amounts to which such holders of the notes may become entitled. There are circumstances under Scottish insolvency law in which the granting by a Scottish company of security and guarantees can be challenged. In most cases this will only arise if the company is placed into administration or liquidation within a specified period of the granting of the guarantee or security. Therefore, if during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is appointed to a Scottish company, he may challenge the validity of the guarantee or security given by such company. The following potential grounds for challenge may apply to guarantees and charges:",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

It will only be a gratuitous alienation if at the time of the transaction or as a result of the transaction, the Scottish company is insolvent (as defined in the U.K. Insolvency Act 1986, as amended). The transaction can be challenged if the Scottish company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of two years from the date the Scottish company grants the security interest or the guarantee or five years in the case of an ‘associate’ of the Scottish Company. A transaction might be subject to being set aside as a gratuitous alienation if the company makes a gift to a person (save in certain specified circumstances), if the company receives no consideration or if the company receives consideration of significantly less value, in money or money’s worth, than the consideration given by such company. However, a court generally will not intervene if the person seeking to uphold the alienation establishes (i) that immediately or at any other time or after the alienation the company’s assets were greater than its liabilities, (ii) the alienation was made for adequate consideration; or (iii) the alienation was a birthday, Christmas or other gift for a charitable purpose to a person not an associate of the company, which in all circumstances it was reasonable for the company (without prejudice to any right or interest acquired in good faith and for value from the recipient of the alienation) to make. If the court determines that the transaction was a gratuitous alienation the court can grant a reduction or for restoration of the property or assets or such other redress as may be appropriate. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the Scottish company was insolvent (the test for which is set out in (i) above).

The transaction can be challenged if the Scottish company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of six months from the date the Scottish company grants the security interest or the guarantee.

Therefore, any insolvency proceedings by or against the Scottish Guarantor would likely be based on Scottish insolvency laws.

There are a number of factors that are taken into account to ascertain the centre of main interests. The centre of main interests should correspond to the place where the company conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and is therefore ascertainable by third parties. The place of the registered office of the company is presumed to be the centre of main interests in the absence of proof to the contrary. The point at which this issue falls to be determined is at the time that the relevant insolvency proceedings are opened.

Until the floating charge security crystallizes, a company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating charge security in the ordinary course of business, meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the charging company so as to give a third party good title to the assets free of the floating charge and so as to give rise to the risk of security being granted over such assets in priority to the floating charge security. In addition, a floating charge security created within six months of the commencement of winding up of the chargor company may be invalid, unless it is proved that the chargor company was solvent immediately after the creation of the charge. Where the assets of the chargor company are insufficient to pay certain preferential debts (these include winding up costs, wages and salaries and retrenchment benefits), those preferential debts would have priority over assets secured by a floating charge. 299 ----- Amounts received in a winding-up or receivership from the realization of assets subject to a floating charge must first be used to pay the holders of any fixed charge over such assets and then certain preferential creditors if applicable (explained above) before any distribution is made to the holders of a floating charge. It is open to a court to find that assignments and charges described as fixed charges constitute floating charges rather than fixed charges, the description given to them as fixed charges not being determinative. One of the three characteristics of a floating charge is the ability of the chargor to carry on business in the ordinary course so far as concerns the particular class of assets in question until some further step is taken by or on behalf of the chargee. Where the chargor, without the consent of the chargee, is free to deal with the assets or the proceeds of such assets that form the subject matter of the charge, the court would be likely to hold that the charge in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge.

The receiver is, in effect, an agent of the chargor company. Its rights and obligations are usually set out in the security document itself. _Appointment_ Receivers can be appointed on the basis of the powers set out in the security document. A person appointed on the basis of a fixed charge over specific assets will act as receiver in respect of those assets. However, mortgages containing a floating charge over all of the assets and undertaking typically provide for enforcement by means of the appointment of a receiver having full powers as a receiver and manager over all of the secured assets (i.e., all of the assets and undertaking of a chargor), including the power of sale of the assets. **USA** Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance laws, the incurrence of the obligations under the notes, the issuance of the guarantees and the grant of security, whether now or in the future, by the Issuer and the Guarantors (together, the “Obligors”) could be avoided, if, among other things, at the time the Obligors incurred the obligations, issued the related guarantee or gave the security, the Obligors intended to hinder, delay or defraud any present or future creditor; or received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the incurrence of such indebtedness or the grant of such security and either: - were insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence or grant of security; - were engaged in a business or transaction for which the Obligors’ remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital; or - intended to incur, or believed that they would incur, debts beyond their ability to pay such debts as they mature. The right of a holder of the notes to enforce its security interests against the Obligors upon the occurrence of an event of default under the indenture governing the notes is likely to be significantly impaired by applicable U.S. bankruptcy law if we became subject to a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code before such security interest was enforced. Upon the commencement of a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor such as a holder of notes is prohibited by the automatic stay imposed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code from obtaining possession or exercising control over its collateral or enforcing its security interest against a debtor in a U.S. bankruptcy case, without bankruptcy court approval, which may not be given. Moreover, the U.S. Bankruptcy Code permits the debtor to continue to retain and use collateral even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection.” The term “adequate protection” is not defined in the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, but it includes making periodic cash payments, providing an additional or replacement lien or granting other relief, in each case to the extent that the collateral decreases in value during the pendency of the bankruptcy case as a result of, among other things, the use, sale or lease of such collateral or the imposition of the automatic stay. The type of adequate protection provided to a secured creditor may vary according to circumstances. A U.S. bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor may not require additional adequate protection for a diminution in the value of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the amount of the debt that it secures. In view of the automatic stay, the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection” and the broad discretionary power of a U.S. bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict: - whether or when a holder of the notes could enforce its security interests; 301 ----- - the value of the collateral at the time of the bankruptcy petition; or - whether or to what extent holders of the notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the collateral through the requirement of “adequate protection.” Any future grant of security interest with regard to the collateral in favor of the notes, including pursuant to security documents delivered after the date of the indenture governing the notes, might be avoidable by the grantor (as debtor in possession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy as a preference if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if the grantor is insolvent at the time of the grant, the security interest permits the holders of the notes to receive a greater recovery than if the bankruptcy case were a case under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code and the security had not been given and a bankruptcy case in respect of the grantor is commenced within 90 days following the grant, or in certain circumstances, a longer period. 302 -----",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

Neither the Issuer nor the initial purchasers are responsible for those operations or procedures. DTC has advised the Issuer that it is: - a limited purpose trust company organized under New York Banking Law; - a “banking organization” under New York Banking Law; - a member of the Federal Reserve System; - a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code; and - a “clearing agency” registered under Section 17A of the U.S. Exchange Act. 306 ----- DTC was created to hold securities for its participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions among its participants. It does this through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of securities participants, eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. DTC’s owners are the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., the American Stock Exchange, Inc., the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and a number of its direct participants. Others, such as banks, brokers and dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant also have access to the DTC system and are known as indirect participants. Like DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic bookentry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions, such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies, that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Because DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the 144A Global Notes only through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream participants.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

The Issuer expects that secondary trading in any certificated notes will also be settled in immediately available funds. Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the Global Notes, cross-market transfers between participants in DTC, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be done through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of each of Euroclear or Clearstream by its common depository; however, such cross market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and regulations and within the established deadlines of such system (Brussels time). Euroclear or Clearstream will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to the common depository to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the Global Notes by DTC, and making and receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement application to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the common depository. Because of the time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant purchasing an interest in a Global Note from a participant in DTC will be credited, and any such crediting will be reported to the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream participant, during the securities settlement processing day (which must be a business day for Euroclear and Clearstream) immediately following the settlement date of DTC. Cash received in Euroclear and Clearstream as a result of a sale of an interest in a Global Note by or through a Euroclear or Clearstream participant to a participant in DTC will be received with value on the settlement date of DTC, but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account only as of the business day for Euroclear or Clearstream following DTC’s settlement date. Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, 307 ----- they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuer, any Guarantor, the Trustee, the Registrar or the Principal Paying Agent will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect participants, of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

While the notes are, and continue to be, quoted Eurobonds, payments of interest on the notes may be made without deduction or withholding for or on account of UK income tax. Securities that have been admitted to the Official List by the Société de la Bourse de Luxembourg and are admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market will meet the requirement to be listed on a recognized stock exchange. So long as this remains the case with respect to the notes, they will therefore constitute quoted Eurobonds. If the notes do not constitute “quoted Eurobonds,” an amount may, subject to any relief available under any applicable double taxation treaty and to the availability of any other relief, have to be withheld on account of UK income tax from payments of interest on the notes at the “basic rate” of UK income tax (currently 20%). If interest were to be paid under deduction of UK income tax, holders of the notes who are not resident in the United Kingdom may be able to recover all or part of the tax deducted if there is an appropriate provision in an applicable double taxation treaty. The interest will have a UK source and accordingly may be chargeable to UK income or corporation tax by direct assessment even where paid without withholding. However, where the interest is paid without deduction or withholding, the interest will not be assessed to UK tax in the hands of holders of the notes who are not resident in the United Kingdom, except where the holder carries on a trade, profession or vocation through a branch or agency (or, in the case of a corporate holder, a permanent establishment) in the United Kingdom in connection with which the interest is received or to which the notes are attributable, in which case (subject to exemptions for interest received by certain categories of agent) tax may be levied on the UK branch, agency or permanent establishment. Holders of the notes may wish to note that the provisions referred to in “Description of the Notes— Payment of Additional Amounts” would not apply if HMRC sought to assess directly the person entitled to the relevant interest to UK tax. However, exemption from, or reduction of, such UK tax liability might be available under an applicable double taxation treaty. Holders of the notes who are individuals may wish to note that HMRC has power to obtain information (including the name and address of the recipient or beneficial owner of the relevant payment) from any person in the United Kingdom who either pays interest to, or receives interest for the benefit of, an individual. Any information obtained may, in certain circumstances, be provided by HMRC to the tax authorities of other jurisdictions. 309 -----",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

If the notes do not constitute deeply discounted securities, the disposal of the notes by an individual holder who is resident or ordinarily resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom or who carries on a trade, profession or vocation in the United Kingdom through a branch or agency to which the notes are attributable may give rise to a chargeable gain or allowable loss for the purposes of UK tax on chargeable gains, depending on individual circumstances. In calculating any gain or allowable loss on the disposal of the notes, sterling values are compared at acquisition and transfer. Accordingly, a taxable gain can arise even where the euro or dollar amount received on a disposal is less than or the same as the euro or dollar amount paid for the notes. Special rules may apply to individuals who have ceased to be resident or ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom and who dispose of their notes before becoming once again resident or ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom. Noteholders are advised to consult their own professional advisors if they require any advice or further information relating to residency. On the disposal of the notes by a holder (if they do not constitute deeply discounted securities), any interest which has accrued since the last interest payment date may be chargeable to tax on income under the rules relating to accrued income profits as set out in Chapter 2 of Part 12 of ITA if that holder is resident or ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom or carries on a trade in the United Kingdom through a branch or agency to which the notes are attributable. Further, if the notes are regarded as variable rate securities for the purposes of the accrued income scheme, the holder may be subject to income tax on such amount as HMRC deems just and reasonable and the transferee of the notes would not be entitled to any corresponding allowance under the accrued income scheme. A note is deemed to be a variable rate security unless throughout the period from issue to redemption the note carries: (i) interest at a fixed rate; (ii) interest bearing a fixed relationship to a standard, published base rate; or (iii) interest bearing a fixed relationship to a published index of prices. Holders of the notes are advised to consult their own professional advisors if they require any advice or further information about the rules relating to accrued income profits in general and the potential tax consequences of holding variable rate securities.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

In connection with the offering, the initial purchasers may purchase and sell the notes in the open market. These transactions may include short sales and purchases on the open market to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the initial purchasers of a greater principal amount of the notes than they are required to purchase in the offering. The initial purchasers must close out any short position by purchasing the notes in the open market. A short position is more likely to be created if the initial purchasers are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the notes in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering. Similar to other purchase transactions, the initial purchasers’ purchases to cover the syndicate short sales may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of the notes or preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the notes. As a result, the price of the notes may be higher than the price that might otherwise exist in the open market.

None of the Canadian Provinces currently have a treaty with the United States of America or any state thereof providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any Federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. Federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in the Canadian Provinces. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in any Canadian Province, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in such Canadian Province (a “Canadian Court”).

The United States and Germany currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters.

Notwithstanding the preceding, a final judgment for payment rendered by any Federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. Federal securities laws, would generally be recognized in an action before a German court, and such German court generally will not investigate the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court. The recognition of the U.S. judgment by a German court would be conditional upon all of the following: - U.S. courts could take jurisdiction of the case in accordance with the principles on jurisdictional competence according to German law; - the document introducing the proceedings was duly made known to the defendant in a timely manner that allowed for adequate defense; - the judgment is not contrary to (i) any prior judgment which became _res judicata rendered by a German court or (ii) any prior judgment which became res judicata rendered by a foreign court which is recognized in Germany and the procedure leading to the respective judgment is not in contradiction to any such prior judgment; - the effects of its recognition will not be in conflict with material principles of German law, including, without limitation, fundamental rights under the constitution of Germany (Grundrechte). In this context, it should be noted that any component of a U.S. Federal or state court civil judgment awarding punitive damages or any other damages which do not serve a compensatory purpose, such as treble damages, will not be enforced in Germany. They are regarded to be in conflict with material principles of German law; - the reciprocity of enforcement of judgments is guaranteed; and - the judgment became res judicata in accordance with the law of the place where it was pronounced.

The United States and Ireland currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any Federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. Federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in Ireland. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in Ireland, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in Ireland.

The 1960 Law provides for the registration and enforcement in Jersey of judgments given in the superior courts of countries which accord reciprocal treatment to judgments given in Jersey. Presently, the reciprocating countries and their superior courts are as follows: - England and Wales House of Lords, Court of Appeal, High Court of Justice; - Scotland Court of Session, Sheriff Court; - Northern Ireland Supreme Court of Judicature; - Isle of Man Her Majesty’s High Court of Justice (including the Staff of Government Division); and 327 ----- - Guernsey Royal Court, Court of Appeal. Not all judgments given by such superior courts can be registered. The registration procedure set out in Part 2 of the 1960 Law applies only to judgments or orders given or made in civil proceedings, or in criminal proceedings for the payment of a sum of money in respect of compensation or damages to an injured party. It does not apply to judgments given by such superior courts on appeal from an inferior court nor, for example, to an English County Court judgment given in proceedings later transferred to the High Court for enforcement. In addition, the judgment must: - be final and conclusive as between the parties (whether or not an appeal in the foreign court is pending or possible); - provide for the payment of a sum of money, but not in respect of taxes or similar charges, or a fine or other penalty; - be for a moneys sum which has not been wholly satisfied; and - be able to be enforced by execution. Further detailed provisions in relation to the enforcement of foreign judgments in Jersey are contained in the 1960 Law. If a foreign judgment falls within Part 2 of the 1960 Law, the judgment creditor must use the registration procedure, as further described in the 1960 Law. Where registration under the 1960 Law is not available, it will be necessary for a holder of a foreign judgment to commence fresh proceedings in Jersey, which proceedings might, inter alia, involve a reexamination of the merits of the case.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

F-15 ----- IAS23 requires the capitalisation of borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset as part of the cost of that asset, in respect of qualifying assets for which the commencement date for capitalisation is on or after 1 January 2009. Previously the Group expensed all borrowing costs immediately. IAS 23 does not require prior periods to be restated. During the year ended 31 December 2009 the Group capitalised €nil of borrowing costs. IAS 1 (Revised) introduces changes to the presentation of the primary financial statements but does not impact on the underlying measurement of transactions, assets or liabilities and accordingly net income, total assets, total liabilities, total equity and cash flows are not affected. Comparative information has been re-presented on a consistent basis. The amendment to IFRS7 requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurement and liquidity risk. In particular, the amendment requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of a fair value measurement hierarchy. As the change in accounting policy only results in additional disclosures, there is no impact on the consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, financial position or cash flows. The revisions to IFRS 3 Business Combinations and IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements introduce a variety of changes to the accounting for acquisitions, including requirements to charge transaction costs to the income statement and in relation to contingent consideration. However, adoption of the revisions had no material impact on the net income for the year ended 31 December 2009 given that no significant acquisitions occurred during that year. The revisions have been applied for all business combinations occurring after 1 January 2009. The change in accounting policy is applied prospectively and accordingly comparative information has not been restated. IFRIC 16 “Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation” applies to an entity that hedges the foreign exchange risk arising from its net investments in foreign operations and wishes to qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with IAS 39. The main expected change in practice is to eliminate the possibility of an entity qualifying for hedge accounting for a hedge of the foreign exchange differences between the functional currency of a foreign operation and the presentation currency of the parent’s consolidated financial statements. The IFRIC recognises the difficulty that entities would face in preparing adequate documentation from the inception of the hedge relationship and therefore requires prospective application of the guidance. This interpretation has had no material impact on this consolidated financial information.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The financial information of subsidiaries are included in this consolidated financial information from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. _Special purpose entities (“SPE”)_ An SPE is consolidated if, based on an evaluation of the substance of its relationship with the Group and the SPE’s risks and rewards, the Group concludes that it controls the SPE. The Group has established an SPE, INEOS Finance Ireland Limited, for a debt securitisation programme. The Group does not have any direct or indirect shareholdings in this SPE. INEOS Finance Ireland Limited is controlled by the Group as it was established under terms that impose strict limitations on the decision-making powers of the SPE’s management that result in the Group receiving the majority of the benefits related to the SPE’s operations and net assets, being exposed to the majority of risks arising from the SPE’s activities, and retaining the majority of the residual or ownership risks related to the SPE and its assets. INEOS Finance Ireland Limited is therefore regarded as an SPE and has been consolidated in this consolidated financial information. F-16 ----- _Associates and jointly controlled entities (equity accounted investees)_ Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20 and 50 percent of the voting power of another entity. Jointly controlled entities are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement and requiring the venturers’ unanimous consent for strategic financial and operating decisions. Associates and jointly controlled entities are accounted for using the equity method (equity accounted investees) and are initially recognised at cost. The Group’s investment in associates and jointly controlled entities includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses. The consolidated financial information include the Group’s share of the total comprehensive income and equity movements of equity accounted investees, from the date that significant influence or joint control commences until the date that significant influence or joint control ceases. When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee, the Group’s carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of an investee.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the consolidated income statement except for differences arising on the retranslation of a financial liability designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation, or qualifying cash flow hedges, which are recognised in other comprehensive income. Nonmonetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign exchange are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined. The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to the Group’s presentational currency, euros, at foreign exchange rates ruling at the reporting date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. The Group applies an average rate for the year where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Exchange differences arising from this translation of foreign operations are taken directly to the translation reserve. They are recycled into the consolidated income statement upon disposal. Exchange differences arising from a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation, the settlement of which is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, are considered to form part of a net investment in a foreign operation and are recognised directly in equity in the translation reserve. Foreign exchange differences arising on the retranslation of a borrowing designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation are recognised directly in equity, in the translation reserve, to the extent that the hedge is effective. When the hedged part of a net investment is disposed of, the associated cumulative amount in equity is transferred to profit or loss as an adjustment to the profit or loss on disposal. The Group has taken advantage of the relief available in IFRS 1 to deem the cumulative translation differences for all foreign operations to be zero at the date of transition to IFRSs (1 January 2007).

To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability.

Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses. _Trade and other payables_ Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value less transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. _Investments in debt and equity securities_ Investments in loans and receivables are stated at amortised cost less impairment. Other investments in debt and equity securities held by the Group are classified as being available-for-sale and are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss being recognised directly in equity (in a fair value reserve), except for impairment losses and, in the case of monetary items such as debt securities, foreign exchange gains and losses. When these investments are derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised directly in equity is recognised in profit or loss. Where these investments are interest-bearing, interest calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in profit or loss. Where no reliable measurement of fair value is available, available-for-sale investments are stated at historic acquisition cost (see Note 15). _Cash and cash equivalents_ Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of the statement of cash flows. F-18 ----- _Interest-bearing borrowings_ Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses. _Debt restructuring_ The Group derecognises financial liabilities in accordance with the provisions in IAS 39. When debt is modified, the Group analyses the modifications from both a quantitative and qualitative perspective to determine if the modifications are substantial and meet the IFRS requirements for derecognition, in which case the debt is treated as extinguished. All fees paid in connection with a debt extinguishment are expensed immediately.

The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement as finance income or expense. Where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged (see below). _Cash flow hedges_ Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in the hedging reserve. Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement as finance income or expense. When the forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or nonfinancial liability, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from the hedging reserve and is included in the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability. If a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability, the associated gains and losses that were recognised directly in equity are reclassified into profit or loss in the same period or periods during which the asset acquired or liability assumed affects profit or loss, e.g. when interest income or expense is recognised. For cash flow hedges, other than those covered by the preceding two policy statements, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and included in the consolidated income statement as an adjustment to turnover and cost of sales in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects turnover and cost of sales in the consolidated income statement. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the Group revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs. If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised in the consolidated income statement immediately. F-19 ----- _Hedge of net investment in foreign operation_ The Group applies hedge accounting to foreign exchange differences arising on the retranslation of a foreign currency loan where the loan is designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation in accordance with IAS 21 and IAS 39. Exchange differences arising on retranslation of foreign currency loans designated as a net investment hedge are taken directly to equity via the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. Cost may include the cost of materials, labour and other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to a working condition for their intended use. Cost may also include the cost of dismantling and removing items and restoring the site on which they are located. Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment. Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are classified as finance leases. Where land and buildings are held under leases the accounting treatment of the land is considered separately from that of the buildings. Leased assets acquired by way of finance lease are stated at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and less accumulated impairment losses. Lease payments are accounted for as described below. Depreciation is charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment. Depreciation commences from the date an asset is brought into service. Land and assets in the course of construction are not depreciated. The estimated useful lives are as follows: - Buildings.......................................................................................................... 10 - 40 years - Plant and equipment and fixtures and fittings.................................................. 3 - 40 years Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date. The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Where an indicator of impairment exists, the Group makes an estimate of the recoverable amount, which is the higher of the asset’s fair value less cost to sell and value in use. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. Assets are derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying value of the asset) is included in the consolidated income statement in the period in which the item is derecognised.

Goodwill represents amounts arising on acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and jointly controlled entities. In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred since 1 January 2007, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. For any acquisitions occurring on or after 1 January 2009, all transaction costs are expensed as incurred. Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to groups of cashgenerating units and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment. In respect of equity accounted investees, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment in the investee. IFRS 1 grants certain transition exemptions from the full requirements of IFRSs in the transition period. The Group elected not to restate business combinations that took place prior to 1 January 2007. In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2007, goodwill is included at 1 January 2007 on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under UK GAAP which was broadly comparable to IFRS save that only separable intangible assets were recognised and goodwill was amortised. On transition to IFRS amortisation of goodwill has ceased and negative goodwill recognised under UK GAAP is included within retained earnings. Negative goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement. _Intangible assets_ Intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. These intangible assets principally comprise intellectual property rights, customer relationships, non-compete agreements and license fees. Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are carried initially at cost. The initial cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of other consideration given to acquire the assets. An intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination is recognised separately from goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably. _Amortisation_ Amortisation is charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and goodwill are systematically tested for impairment at each reporting date. Other intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use. The estimated useful lives are as follows: - Customer relationships.................................................................................. 3 years - Intellectual property rights............................................................................ 10 - 15 years - Non-compete agreements.............................................................................. life of the agreement - Licenses ........................................................................................................ up to 15 years These intangible assets are tested for impairment at the end of the reporting period if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Useful lives are examined on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis. _Research and development_ Expenditure on research activities is recognised in the consolidated income statement as an expense as incurred. F-21 ----- Expenditure on development activities is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and the Group intends to and has the technical ability and sufficient resources to complete development, future economic benefits are probable and if the Group can measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development. Development activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products or processes. The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads. Where regulatory and other uncertainties are such that the criteria are not met, the expenditure is recognised in the income statement. Other development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.

A financial asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events have had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life and intangible assets that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated at the end of the reporting period. An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement. Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to cash-generating units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro rata basis. A cash generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. Goodwill, assets that have an indefinite useful life and intangible assets that are not yet available for use were tested for impairment as at 1 January 2007, the date of transition to IFRSs, even though no indication of impairment existed. When a decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset has been recognised directly in equity and there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired, the cumulative loss that had been recognised directly in equity is recognised in profit or loss even though the financial asset has not been derecognised. The amount of the cumulative loss that is recognised in profit or loss is the difference between the acquisition cost and current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in profit or loss. F-22 ----- **NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION FOR THE YEARS ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2009, 2008 AND 2007 (FORMING PART OF THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION) 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES** _Calculation of recoverable amount_ The recoverable amount of the Group’s receivables is calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition of these financial assets). Receivables are not discounted where their duration is less than one year or where the effect of discounting is not material. The recoverable amount of other assets is the greater of their fair values less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. _Reversals of impairment_ An impairment loss in respect of a held-to-maturity security or receivable carried at amortised cost is reversed if the subsequent increase in recoverable amount can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised. An impairment loss in respect of an investment in an equity instrument classified as available for sale is not reversed through profit or loss. If the fair value of a debt instrument classified as available-for-sale increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in profit or loss, the impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed when there is an indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist and there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

The Group also provides unfunded early retirement benefits, long service awards and an incentive plan for certain employees. The Group provides health care insurance to eligible retired employees and their dependants, primarily in the United States and Belgium. _Defined contribution plans_ A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the consolidated income statement as incurred. _Defined benefit plans_ A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans and other post employment benefits is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets (at bid price) are deducted. The liability discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on AA credit rated bonds denominated in the currency of, and that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of, the Group’s obligations. The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised as an expense in the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested. To the extent that the benefits vest immediately, the expense is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement. All actuarial gains and losses as at 1 January 2007, the date of transition to IFRSs, were recognised. In respect of actuarial gains and losses that arise subsequent to 1 January 2007, the Group recognises them in the period they occur directly in equity through the statement of comprehensive income. Where the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the asset recognised is limited to the net total of any unrecognised actuarial losses and past service costs and the present value of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. The pension scheme surplus (to the extent that it is recoverable) or deficit is recognised in full. The movement in the scheme surplus/deficit is split between: - cost of sales, - net finance costs and, - in net expense recognised directly in equity, the actuarial gains and losses. F-24 ----- _Short-term benefits_ Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably. _Incentive plan_ Certain employees of the Group are eligible to participate in an incentive plan (the Plan) operated by INEOS Limited, the ultimate parent of INEOS Group Holdings plc in the United Kingdom. INEOS Limited issues “Business Tracker Shares” in relation to each of the businesses operated by INEOS Limited and its subsidiaries, including those businesses within the INEOS Group Holdings plc group. These Business Tracker Shares entitle the holder of the share to appreciation in market value (rather than the totality of the market value) of the relevant business compared with the market value at the date of acquisition of the relevant share. Determination of market values, and any discretionary adjustments, is made by a committee (the Special Committee) of INEOS Limited. The Plan is considered to be in the nature of a Share-based Payment arrangement within the scope of IFRS 2. The INEOS Group Holdings plc group neither receives nor makes any payments and incurs no liabilities in respect of its employees’ participation in the Plan. Under IFRS 2 (as amended in June 2009 for “Group Cash-settled Share-based Payment Transactions” which the Directors have elected to adopt early) the Group recognises any deemed cost of the arrangement in accordance with the requirements applicable to equity-settled share-based payment transactions, with a corresponding increase in equity as a contribution from the parent. Participating employees purchase Business Tracker Shares from the Trust which administers the Plan at a price which is related to the approximate market value of the relevant Business Unit. Accordingly the Directors believe that the net fair value of the benefit at the date of grant after taking account of the payment for the shares is not significant and no cost has been recognised in this consolidated financial information.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

Revenue arising from the sale of goods is recognised when the goods are either dispatched or delivered depending on the relevant delivery terms and the point at which risks and rewards have been transferred to the buyer when the prices are determinable and when collectability is considered probable. Services provided to third parties include administrative and operational services provided to other chemical companies with units on our sites and services under tolling arrangements.

Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.

The business segments are determined based on the Group’s management and internal reporting structure and the aggregation criteria set out in IFRS 8. Segment results that are reported to the Board of Directors include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.

The Scheme encourages companies to reduce carbon emissions by offering financial incentives if they achieve their annual reduction targets. If a company reduces emissions beyond their target then the surplus may be traded in the form of emissions permits. The incentive money due from the EU Emissions Trading Scheme is recognised in the consolidated income statement once the reduction targets have been met. The emissions permits allocated under the Scheme are at nil cost. The Group recognises the revenue from such permits upon their sale to third parties. The Kyoto Protocol sets legally binding targets for cutting emissions and provides for three international “flexible mechanisms” to be used by developed countries in cost effectively meeting their greenhouse gas emissions targets, one of which is the Clean Development Mechanism (“CDM”). This permits industrialised countries to meet part of their commitments through projects in developing countries. The CDM programme provides incentives for the project participants in the form of Certified Emissions Reductions (“CERs”). It is the trading of these CERs that provides the market incentive to reduce emissions. The Group is involved in a number of CDM projects. CERs produced from these projects are recorded at nil cost. CERs purchased from third parties are recognised within stock on the basis of purchased cost. The Group recognises the revenue from sale of CERs upon their sale to third parties. The Group recognises a provision for emissions produced. The provision is measured at the carrying amount of the emission rights held (nil if granted, otherwise at cost) or, in the case of a shortfall, at the current fair value of the emission rights needed.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

The interpretation is part of the IASB’s annual improvement project published in April 2009. This interpretation provides guidance on accounting for arrangements whereby an entity distributes noncash assets to shareholders either as a distribution of reserves or as dividends.

OPERATING SEGMENTS,2434.7,,2434.7.1,,"The determination of the Group’s operating segments is based on the business units for which information is reported to the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker. The Group has four reportable segments, as described below. - The Group’s Olefins and Polymers business units produce olefins and related products and a broad range of polymers. The Group’s olefins businesses are focused on ethylene and propylene, which are the two largest volume olefins globally and are key building blocks for polymers. These olefins are primarily used as feedstock for the Group’s polymers business. In addition, the Group sells olefins to third party customers for a variety of industrial and consumer applications, including plastics, rubber and fibre. O&P North America segment—In North America, the group’s Olefins and Polymers business comprises five sites including major facilities in Chocolate Bayou, Texas, and Battleground, Texas. O&P Europe segment—In Europe, the Group owns and operates three major cracker complexes, two that are integrated with our refineries in Grangemouth, United Kingdom and Lavéra, France and one in Cologne, Germany. Each of these sites includes polymers and derivatives units. - Refining—Oil refining is the process of separating, converting and treating hydrocarbon molecules present in crude oil to produce marketable finished petroleum products, such as gasoline, diesel, liquefied petroleum gas (‘LPG’), naphtha, heating and fuel oils and bitumen. Refining is primarily a margin based business where both the feedstocks and refined petroleum products are commodities. The Group owns and operates two refineries which are both fully integrated with petrochemical plants located at the same sites. The Group’s principal refining products are transport fuels (particularly diesel fuel and gasoline), LPG, naphtha, and heating and fuel oils. - Chemical Intermediates—This reportable segment is the aggregation, in compliance with IFRS 8, of a number of different business units with similar economic and other characteristics. Chemical Intermediates are high-value added chemical products used as key components in a variety of consumer and industrial products. The Group’s chemical intermediates businesses are exposed to similar key commodities, namely oil and gas. They produce a range of products including phenol, alpha olefins, solvents, industrial chemicals, chlorine, PVC, hydrofluorocarbons, specialty fluorochemicals and nitriles. The Chemical Intermediates processes are similar in that they are all F-28 ----- capital intensive and based upon processing and mixing chemical raw materials to produce chemical products for the next stage along the value chain. The Chemical Intermediates products are distributed on a business-to-business basis across the world. This is performed using similar conventional methods of pipeline, truck, rail or ship container depending on the customer location and size of the order. The Chemical Intermediates customer base is similar in that the customers are generally manufacturers of consumer and industrial products in developed markets and mature industrial economies. The accounting policies of all of the reportable segments are as described in Note 1. Information regarding the operations of each reportable segment is included in the following tables. Performance is measured based on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and exceptional items other than exceptional cost of sales items, measured under UK GAAP (“Segment EBITDA”) except that share of associate’s revenue is not allocated to segments as would be the case under UK GAAP. Segment EBITDA is used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries. Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arm’s length basis. Information regarding segments reviewed by management includes management accounts comprising the balance sheet, profit or loss, cash flows and other financial and non financial information used to manage the business. Adjustments in the following tables comprise the following items: - Corporate assets and liabilities such as the Group headquarters, investments in associates and joint ventures and the major group borrowings; - Elimination of inter-segmental transactions and balances; and - Differences arising from conversion of UK GAAP to IFRS. These include treatment of negative goodwill, amortisation of goodwill, accounting for derivatives, treatment of deferred tax on pensions and accounting for joint ventures.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

The valuation technique used a discounted cash flow technique using an estimated yield for similar debt to determine the fair value of the modified debt. The estimated yield was determined by reference to consensus pricing in respect of the Existing Facilities Agreement debt as adjusted for market illiquidity and other factors distorting prices during July 2009 due to the impact of the global financial crisis.

The forecasts are based on current performance and management’s assumptions regarding the future development of individual parameters including raw material prices and profit margins, utilising available market pricing forecasts. Future assumptions regarding market demand are based on external macroeconomic sources and specific data relevant to the petrochemical industry and management’s knowledge of the local markets in which it operates. The cash flows after the plan period are based on an average of each of the years in the five year plan to take account of the cyclical nature of the industry extrapolated using long term growth rates as set out in the table below. No impairment charge has been recorded in these accounts as a result of the annual impairment test. Trading performance in 2009 was in line with plan despite the market turbulence at the end of 2008 which had a significant effect in 2009. The market has recovered steadily throughout 2009 and this is forecast to continue over the plan period.

At 31 December 2007, 2008 and 2009 there were no significant trade, related party or other receivable balances not past due that were subsequently impaired. Due to the global activities and diversified customer structure of the Group, there is no significant concentration of credit risk other than with BP Plc (‘BP’) which represents approximately 14% of trade receivables. The concentration of credit risk arises due to the number of commercial agreements that the Group has with BP. The credit risk associated with these receivables is managed through a master bilateral netting agreement where, in the event of termination of commercial agreements, balances owed from BP will be offset against the Group’s balances payable to BP. During the normal course of business amounts owed by BP are normally less than the Group’s payable to BP in relation to purchases of crude oil, feed stocks and other inputs. During 2007, 2008 and 2009 there were no significant trade, related party or other receivable balances that were subject to renegotiation of terms. Credit enhancements are held in respect of trade and other receivables in the form of €295.7 million (2008: €255.5 million, 2007: € 464.9 million) of assets pledged as security against amounts owed to the Group of which €12.0 million (2008: €33.8 million, 2007: €31.2 million) is in respect of amounts falling overdue. Trade receivable balances totalling €1,096.7 million (2008: € 1,118.5 million, 2007: €1,858.6 million) have been pledged as security against amounts drawn down under the Receivables Securitisation Facility, described in Note 20, totalling €605.5 million (2008: €750.6 million, 2007: €1,089.7 million). In accordance with IAS 39 F-57 ----- ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ the trade receivable balances pledged as security do not qualify for derecognition and are included within the trade receivable balances above.

The Term Loans outstanding at 31 December 2009 before issues costs were €4,425.8 million (2008: €4,669.8 million, 2007: €5,020.2 million), of which €260.0 million (2008: €231.9 million, 2007: € 224.7 million) is due within one year. The total amounts outstanding on Term Loan A were €727.2 million (2008: €929.0 million, 2007: €1,151.8 million), Term Loan B were €1,524.3 million (2008: €1,545.4 million, 2007: €1,609.2 million), Term Loan C were €1,524.3 million (2008: €1,545.4 million, 2007: € 1,609.2 million), Term Loan D were €650.0 million (2008: € 650.0 million, 2007: €650.0 million). The Revolving Credit Facility outstanding at 31 December 2009 before issues costs was € 577.9 million (2008: €410.0 million, 2007: €nil). As a result of the substantial modification of the Existing Facilities Agreement Debt on 17 July 2009 (see below and Note 5), the unamortised issue costs at this date were written off. F-59 ----- Term Loan A is repayable in 14 semi-annual instalments beginning on 31 December 2006 ranging from 6.0% to 10.0% of the principal amount of the loan up until the final repayment on 16 December 2012. Term Loan B is repayable in 9 instalments beginning on 31 December 2006 ranging from 1.0% to 46.5% of the principal amount of the loan up until the final repayment on 16 December 2013. Term Loan C is repayable in 10 instalments beginning on 31 December 2006 ranging from 1.0% to 46.5% of the principal amount of the loan up until the final repayment on 16 December 2014. Term Loan D is repayable in full on 16 December 2015. On 19 December 2008, the Group obtained a waiver from its senior banking syndicate of its Debt Service Cover and Interest Cover tests, together with an amendment to its Leverage test for the period ending 31 December 2008. The amended leverage test was subsequently met. The Group also obtained an agreement to defer the testing of the Interest Cover and Leverage tests for the period ending 31 March 2009 until 31 May 2009. On 17 July 2009 the Group successfully reached agreement with its senior lenders on a package of amendments to the Group’s financing arrangements, including a reset of the Group’s financial covenants. The remuneration for the senior lenders consisted of a consent fee of € 79.0 million. The Group has assessed that the package of amendments to the Senior Facilities Agreement represents a substantial modification and results in the extinguishment of the existing debt. As a result, the existing debt has been derecognised and the modified debt recognised at fair value. The Group has estimated the fair value of the modified debt by reference to a valuation technique as the Senior Facilities Agreement debt is not quoted and information about transactions in the Group’s debt is not available. The valuation technique used a discounted cash flow model using an estimated yield for similar debt to determine the fair value of the modified debt. The estimated yield was determined by reference to consensus pricing in respect of the Existing Facilities Agreement debt as adjusted for market illiquidity and other factors distorting prices during July 2009 due to the impact of the global financial crisis. The leverage, interest cover and debt service cover covenants have now been reset for the remaining term of the Senior Facilities Agreement. In addition, a new senior leverage covenant and a minimum available liquidity covenant have been introduced. There have also been a number of amendments to the definitions used for the financial covenants. Net debt denominated in currencies other than the euro will be translated at the average rate for the period rather than the period end rate to match the rates used to translate the operating results for the same period. The operating results of the Group will now be measured on the basis of replacement cost EBITDA for Refining and historical cost EBITDA for the rest of the Group, rather than just historical cost EBITDA. This change will remove most of the current volatility in our operating results caused by unpredictable fluctuations in crude oil prices. The Term Loans and Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to a margin plus either EURIBOR or LIBOR. The applicable per annum cash margins as at December 31, 2009 are 4.00% per annum for the Term Loan A facility; 4.50% per annum for the Term Loan B facility; 5.00% per annum for the Term Loan C facility; 6.00% per annum for Revolving Credit Facility; and 6.00% per annum for the Term D Loan Facility. With effect from July 17, 2009 the Term Loans are also subject to a Payment in Kind (‘PIK’) margin of 2.00% per annum. The cash margins on Term Loans A and B are subject to a reduction based on certain financial tests. The PIK margin is subject to a reduction based upon achieving certain reductions in total leverage, together with achieving certain credit ratings with Moody’s and Standard and Poor. A US dollar LIBOR floor of 3.00% applies to all US dollar denominated Term Loans and is payable in cash. A EURIBOR floor of 3.25% applies to all Euro denominated Term Loans. The difference between actual EURIBOR at the start of each interest period and the floor will be accrued over the period and is not payable in cash until the final repayment dates of the applicable loans. If available liquidity (cash and amounts available under the Revolving Credit Facility) of the Group exceeds €750 million the EURIBOR floor reduces to 3.00% and will become payable in cash. INEOS Group Holdings plc and substantially all of its material subsidiaries are guarantors of the Senior Facilities Agreement. Their obligations are secured by fixed and floating charges over all of the assets of INEOS Holdings Limited and substantially all of the assets of those material subsidiaries. F-60 ----- The Senior Facilities Agreement contains numerous customary operating and financial covenants including requirements to maintain minimum coverage of interest expense, minimum coverage of total debt service and a maximum leverage ratio. In addition, the Senior Facilities Agreement includes covenants relating to, among other things, limitations on indebtedness, ability to give guarantees, creation of security interests, making acquisitions and investments, disposing of assets and paying dividends.",N/A,as_expected,2010,455

Management considers that there is no geographical concentration of credit risk. The Group has established a credit policy under which each new customer is analysed individually for creditworthiness before the Group’s standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered or are adjusted accordingly.

The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group. The Group’s exposure to liquidity risk is limited by the fact that it operates with significant cash resources, and it maintains the most appropriate mix of short, medium and long-term borrowings from the Group’s lenders. F-76 ----- The Group is reliant on committed funding from a variety of sources at Group and subsidiary company level to meet the anticipated needs of the Group for the period covered by the Group’s budget. The Group forecasts on a regular basis the expected cash flows that will occur on a weekly and monthly basis. This information is used in conjunction with the weekly reporting of actual cash balances at bank in order to calculate the level of funding that will be required in the short and medium term. On a monthly basis the level of headroom on existing facilities is reported and forecast forward until the end of the financial period.

F-79 ----- Foreign exchange risk arises from net investments in foreign operations, future commercial transactions, and recognised assets and liabilities. The Group applies hedge accounting to foreign currency differences arising on the retranslation of a financial liability designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. When the settlement of a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, foreign exchange gains and losses arising from such a monetary item is considered to form part of a net investment in a foreign operation and changes in the fair value are recognised directly within equity. A substantial portion of the Group’s revenue is generated in, or linked to, the US dollar and the euro. In the refining business the prices of finished products and of the underlying raw materials are primarily denominated in US dollars, while the costs are largely denominated in euros and sterling. In the European petrochemical business, product prices, certain feedstock costs and most other costs are denominated in euro and sterling. In the US petrochemical and specialty chemicals businesses, product prices, raw materials costs and most other costs are primarily denominated in US dollars. The Group generally does not enter into foreign currency exchange instruments to hedge foreign currency transaction exposure, although the Group has done so in the past and may do so in the future. The Group benefits from natural hedging, to the extent that currencies in which net cash flows are generated from the Group’s operations, are matched against long-term indebtedness.

Available for sale financial assets are accounted for at fair value based on the present value of future cash flows where such information is readily available. However, as explained in Note 15, the Group’s available for sale financial assets include certain equity interests which are not quoted and for which there is no active market. In these circumstances, in the absence of reliable information, the Group considers that a reliable determination of fair value is not practicable and such investments are recorded at their acquisition cost. The fair value has therefore been presented as the equivalent to the carrying value at the reporting date. The remainder of available for sale financial assets are valued at fair value based on the present value of future cash flows estimated from financial information made available during the year as a result of a recent transaction in the investment. For the available for sale investments carried at fair value a 10 percent increase and decrease in transaction prices at the reporting date would have decreased and increased the loss for the year by €4.6 million.

The Group defines its capital employed of €6,517.1 million (2008: €7,351.7 million, 2007: €8,279.4 million) as shareholders’ equity of €(570.1) million (2008: €54.1 million, 2007: €1,000.1 million) and net debt (net of debt issue costs) of €7,087.2 million (2008: €7,297.6 million, 2007: € 7,279.3 million). The significant reduction in capital employed during the year arises in respect of the loss for the year, actuarial losses on defined benefit pension schemes and foreign exchange losses. F-82 ----- The principal sources of debt available to the Group at 31 December 2009 include the Senior Facilities Agreement, Senior Notes, INEOS Vinyls Senior Notes and Receivables Securitisation Facility and are described in Note 20 along with the key operating and financial covenants that apply to these facilities. As described in Note 20, on 19 December 2008 the Group obtained a waiver in respect of certain covenants in the Senior Facilities Agreement. On 19 July 2009 the Group successfully reached agreement with its senior lenders on a package of amendments to the Senior Facilities Agreement, including the reset of financial covenants (see Note 20). These amendments are key to the Group meeting its objectives for managing capital. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, issue new shares, raise new debt or sell assets to reduce debt.
