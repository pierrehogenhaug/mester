(c) VEIL was incorporated on October 26, 2010 and acquired Vue Enterainment Investment Limited and its subsidiaries on December 21, 2010. This also impacts the comparability of our segmental results, as presented in greater detail in ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations’’, as the results of operations of Multikino and CinemaxX are included in our Continental Europe segment, and the results of operations of Apollo are included in our U.K. segment, since the respective dates of acquisition of each business.

The reclassifications (i) amend the allocation of certain results of operations of CinemaxX between revenue, cost of sales and administrative expenses as compared to their allocation in the 2012 consolidated financial statements, and has no impact on the total ‘Loss for the Period’ or EBITDA; and (ii) amend the allocation of certain amounts due to creditors between loans and other creditors.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475
887,Offerings 2014.md,4,CERTAIN DEFINITIONS,4.4,Acquisition of The Space,4.4.1,Summary of Certain Differences Between U.K. GAAP and IFRS,"Outlined below is a summary of certain differences between U.K. GAAP and IFRS. We cannot offer any assurance that the differences described below would, in fact, be the accounting principles creating the greatest differences between the financial statements of the Issuer and VEIL, or the financial information for xiii ----- the 12 months ended June 30, 2014 of The Space, prepared under IFRS and under U.K. GAAP. In addition, we cannot estimate the net effect that (i) applying IFRS would have on the Issuer’s or VEIL’s results of operations or financial condition, or any component thereof, in any of the presentations of financial information in this offering memorandum or (ii) applying U.K. GAAP would have on the financial information for the 12 months ended June 30, 2014 of The Space presented in the section ‘‘Summary Historical Financial Information and Operating Data’’ in this offering memorandum. Nevertheless, the effect of such differences may be material. In making an investment decision, investors must rely upon their own examination of the Company, the terms of the offering and the financial information. Potential investors should consult their own professional advisers for an understanding of the differences between IFRS and U.K. GAAP, and how those differences might affect the financial information contained herein. _Financial Statement Presentation_ Under IFRS, the presentation of the balance sheet is based on either a current/non-current split of assets and liabilities or based on liquidity where such a presentation provides information that is reliable and more relevant. Under U.K. GAAP, the balance sheet cannot be presented on a liquidity basis only. Under U.K. GAAP, the cash flow statement is based on changes in cash, which represents cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand less overdrafts repayable on demand. Under IFRS, the cash flow statement is based on changes in cash, which represents cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand and cash equivalents, which are short-term highly liquid investments, less overdrafts repayable on demand, which form an integral part of an enterprise’s cash management. There are several presentational differences between IFRS and U.K. GAAP in respect of the balance sheet, including: (1) software development and purchased software costs are recognised within tangible assets under U.K. GAAP but are reclassified as an intangible asset under IFRS, and (2) cash placed on short-term deposit with original maturities of greater than three months are classified as cash at bank and in hand under U.K. GAAP but are reclassified as a financial asset under IFRS. The disclosures in the explanatory notes to the financial statements are also more extensive under IFRS than U.K. GAAP. _Business Combinations_ U.K. GAAP requires that intangible assets be separately recognized in a business combination only if they can be disposed of separately without disposing of the business of the entity and if their value can be measured reliably on initial measurement. IFRS requires that all the intangible assets at the acquisition date be recognized separately in the consolidated financial statements if they meet the definition of an intangible asset and if their fair value can be measured reliably. In contrast to U.K. GAAP, an intangible asset is required to be recognized if it arises from contractual or other legal rights, regardless of whether those rights are transferable or separable from the entity or from other rights and obligations. Under IFRS, there is a rebuttable presumption that the fair value of the intangible asset can be measured reliably if it has a finite useful life. U.K. GAAP requires that goodwill is amortized over its estimated useful life and tested for impairment annually and if events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable. IFRS prohibits the amortization of goodwill. Instead, the acquirer must perform a goodwill impairment test annually and if events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable, in accordance with lAS 36. Under IFRS, all acquisition related costs, except costs to issue debt or equity, are recognized immediately in the income statement. Under U.K. GAAP, these costs can be capitalized as part of goodwill. _Operating Segments_ Under UK GAAP segment information is presented on a ‘‘risks and rewards’’ basis. Under IFRS information must be disclosed to enable users of its financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business activities and environments in which it operates. Segment information is required to be presented on the same basis as for internal reporting. _Deferred Taxes_ IFRS takes a balance sheet approach to deferred tax whereby deferred tax is recognized in the balance sheet by applying the appropriate tax rate to the temporary differences arising between the carrying value of assets and liabilities and their tax base. Under U.K. GAAP, deferred tax is provided in respect of timing xiv ----- differences arising in the profit and loss account. U.K. GAAP permits, but does not require, the discounting of deferred tax liabilities. IFRS prohibits discounting. _Loans and Borrowings_ Under U.K. GAAP, loans and borrowings such as bank debt are recognized at the nominal value of the debt assumed. Under IFRS, the debt is recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. It is then subsequently stated at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest method is used to calculate the amortized cost of the debt and to allocate the associated interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts the cash flows associated with the debt to its net carrying amount at initial recognition. _Financial Instruments_ Under U.K. GAAP, certain financial instruments, such as derivative financial instruments, are not recorded in financial statements where the underlying transaction to which they are associated is recorded. IFRS requires many financial instruments, such as derivative financial instruments, to be carried on the balance sheet at fair value. _Leases_ Under U.K. GAAP, lease incentives are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the period to the next rent review date. Under IFRS, lease incentives are recognized as a reduction of rental expense over the term of the lease. Under U.K. GAAP contractual increases acting as a proxy for inflation are generally accounted for in the period in which they arise. IFRS requires non-contingent contractual rent payments to be spread on a straight line basis over the term of the lease, resulting in an additional liability and increased rent expense being recognised in early years which unwinds over time. U.K. GAAP considers land and buildings together when determining classification as an operating or finance lease. Under IFRS the land and building elements of a property lease are considered separately to classify based on fair values. Under U.K. GAAP a lessee recognises the aggregate benefits of incentives received from a landlord as a reduction of rental expense over the shorter of the lease term and a period ending on a date from which it is expected that the prevailing market rental will be payable (i.e., a market rent review). Under IFRS, the aggregate benefit is recognised over the lease term (market rent reviews are ignored) on a straight line basis unless another systematic basis is representative of the true pattern of the benefit of the leased asset.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475
887,Offerings 2014.md,4,CERTAIN DEFINITIONS,4.4,Acquisition of The Space,4.4.2,,"On October 16, 2014, the Issuer entered into The Space Acquisition Agreement to acquire, directly and indirectly, the entire corporate capital of Capitolosette from RTI and 21 Investimenti, on behalf of Fondo 21 Investimenti II, and to acquire the shares in The Space Entertainment S.p.A. held by Mr. Corrado and Mr. Canepa (together with RTI and 21 Investimenti, ‘‘the Sellers’’). Upon completion of The Space Acquisition, Capitolosette will become a subsidiary of The Space Bidco, which itself is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Issuer. We intend to account for The Space Acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that we recognize the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingencies assumed at their fair value as of the completion of the applicable acquisition. If we complete The Space Acquisition, The Space’s results of operations will be consolidated with ours in the future. As a result, our financial results in the future would not be directly comparable to those in this offering memorandum.

Such pro forma measures are not financial measures defined in accordance with U.K. GAAP or IFRS and, as such, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. For a further description of the pro forma financial information as of and for the 52 weeks ended August 28, 2014 presented below, see ‘‘Presentation of _Financial and Other Information — Pro Forma Financial Information.’’_ Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA for the 52 weeks ended August 28, 2014 is derived as (i) the Adjusted EBITDA for the Issuer for the 52 weeks ended August 28, 2014, plus (ii) the pre-acquisition Adjusted EBITDA of Multikino for the period September 1, 2013 to September 30, 2013 which is derived from its underlying books and records provided to us in the course of the acquisition process, which were maintained in accordance with IFRS, plus (iii) the Estimated Adjusted EBITDA of The Space for the 12 months ended June 30, 2014 which is derived from the underlying books and records of The Space which are maintained in accordance with IFRS. See ‘‘— Summary of Certain Differences Between U.K. GAAP and IFRS.’’ The calculation of Estimated Adjusted EBITDA of The Space is based in part on the judgement of management of The Space with respect to certain costs and expenses, which are considered non-recurring, and the unaudited management information and books and records of The Space. These numbers have not xv ----- been audited or reviewed by our independent auditors or the independent auditors of The Space. The Estimated Adjusted EBITDA of The Space is included in this offering memorandum as we believe it provides a useful measure of our results of operations after giving effect to the results of The Space; however, this information does not constitute a measure of financial performance under U.K. GAAP or IFRS and should not be considered a substitute for operating profit, net profit, cash flow or other financial measures computed in accordance with U.K. GAAP or IFRS, or as a measure of our future results of operations or liquidity. Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may differ from the definition of Estimated Adjusted EBITDA used by The Space, and therefore these measures may not be comparable. As all companies do not calculate these financial measures in the same manner, the presentation of each financial measure may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Results indicated by certain of these measures may not be realized, and funds depicted by certain of these measures may not be available for management’s discretionary use if such results are not realized. It should also be noted that U.K. GAAP differs in certain respects from IFRS. With respect to the adjustment for the Estimated Adjusted EBITDA of The Space it does not give effect to the differences between U.K. GAAP and IFRS. These differences could be material to Estimated Adjusted EBITDA of The Space, and as as a consequence, to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA. A summary of certain differences between U.K. GAAP and IFRS that our management believes could have a significant impact on these measures is included above in ‘‘— _Summary of Certain Differences Between _U.K. GAAP and IFRS’’._ The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities Act, the Prospectus Directive or any generally accepted accounting standards. The unaudited pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Neither the assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments nor the resulting unaudited pro forma combined financial information have been audited or reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted auditing standards. The unaudited _pro forma consolidated financial information is for informational purposes only and should not be considered indicative of actual results that would have been achieved had the Transactions and the acquisition of Multikino been completed on the dates indicated and do not purport to indicate our future consolidated results of operations or financial position. The actual results may differ significantly from those reflected in the unaudited pro forma combined financial information for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, differences in assumptions used to prepare the unaudited _pro forma combined financial information. The unaudited _pro forma financial information should be read in conjunction with the information contained in ‘‘Selected Historical Consolidated Financial Information,’’ ‘‘Management’s Discussion and _Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,’’ and the Consolidated Financial Statements._",N/A,as_expected,2014,475
887,Offerings 2014.md,4,CERTAIN DEFINITIONS,4.6,Other Financial Measures,4.6.1,,"We have presented certain information in this offering memorandum that are non-U.K. GAAP and non-IFRS measures. As used in this offering memorandum, this information includes ‘‘EBITDA,’’ ‘‘Adjusted EBITDA,’’ ‘‘Adjusted EBITDA Margin,’’ ‘‘pro forma Adjusted EBITDA,’’ ‘‘EBITDAR’’ and ‘‘Adjusted EBITDAR.’’ Our management believes that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, pro forma Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDAR and Adjusted EBITDAR are meaningful for investors because they provide an analysis of our operating results, profitability and ability to service debt and because EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, pro forma Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDAR and Adjusted EBITDAR are used by our chief decision makers to assess our operating results, establish operational and strategic targets and make business decisions. In addition, we believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, _pro forma Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDAR and Adjusted EBITDAR are measures commonly used by investors and other interested parties in our industry. Although we are presenting these measures to enhance the understanding of our historical operating performance, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, _pro forma Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDAR and Adjusted EBITDAR or any other non-U.K. GAAP or non-IFRS financial measures should not be considered alternatives to operating profit as an indicator of our operating performance, or alternatives to cash flows from operating activities as measures of our liquidity. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, pro forma Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDAR and Adjusted EBITDAR have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation. Some of these limitations are: - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; xvi ----- - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; - they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to service interest or principal payments, on our debts; - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDAR and Adjusted EBITDAR do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such replacements; - some of the exceptional items that we eliminate in calculating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDAR and Adjusted EBITDAR reflect cash payments that were made, or will in the future be made; and - the fact that other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDAR and Adjusted EBITDAR differently than we do, which limits their usefulness as comparative measures. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, pro forma Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDAR and Adjusted EBITDAR are unaudited and are not measures of financial performance under U.K. GAAP or IFRS. Our computation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, pro forma Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDAR and Adjusted EBITDAR and other non-U.K. GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDAR and Adjusted EBITDAR, we encourage you to evaluate each and the reasons we consider it appropriate as a method of supplemental analysis. You should be aware that as an analytical tool, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDAR and Adjusted EBITDAR are subject to all of the limitations applicable to EBITDA. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDAR and Adjusted EBITDAR are not audited. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDAR and Adjusted EBITDAR should be viewed as measures of operating performance that are a supplement to, and not a substitute for U.K. GAAP or IFRS measures of income or cash flows, and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of our competitors.

887,Offerings 2014.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Overview,9.1.1,,"We believe we are Europe’s third largest cinema operator by number of screens with operations predominantly in the United Kingdom, Germany and Poland. We have grown our portfolio through a combination of new cinema developments and acquisitions of cinemas in the United Kingdom and internationally. We currently operate 150 cinemas with 1,359 screens located across eight countries, and upon completion of The Space Acquisition, we will operate 186 cinemas with 1,721 screens located across nine countries. We believe our cinema portfolio in the United Kingdom represents the newest, most modern chain of cinemas in the country. In the United Kingdom, 98.8% of our cinemas are multiplexes, 95.9% have stadium seating that provides unobstructed views of the screen and all are fully digital. In the United Kingdom, all of our cinemas use Sony Digital Cinema 4K digital projection technology, which provides four times the resolution of 2K digital projectors. We have a broad reach in the United Kingdom and we estimate that over 65% of the population lives within a 30-minute drive of a Vue cinema. According to IBOE/Rentrak, our GBOR market share in the United Kingdom was approximately 23.4% for the 52 weeks ended November 28, 2013 and 22.8% for the 39 weeks ended August 28, 2014. We operate five of the top 20 grossing box office cinemas in the United Kingdom, with a strong presence in the key London and West End markets, including our Westfield London site which was the highest grossing box office cinema in the United Kingdom for the 52 weeks ended November 28, 2013 and the 39 weeks ended August 28, 2014. We have leveraged our strong operational knowledge and experience with successful integrations of acquisitions to enter new European markets through selective strategic acquisitions of leading cinema operators. These European markets are generally more fragmented and less developed than the United Kingdom and we believe they offer opportunities for consolidation and growth. In August 2012, we established our presence in Germany and Denmark through the acquisition of CinemaxX, Germany’s second largest cinema operator by number of screens (excluding Cineplex Group, a co-operative of independent operators) currently and at the time of the acquisition of CinemaxX. Our cinemas in Germany are typically situated in premium city center locations within the 20 largest German cities where population densities are highest. We believe that all of our German cinemas offer state-of-the-art facilities; for example, all of our cinemas in Germany have 4K digital projection technology. We also recently expanded into Poland, Latvia and Lithuania through the acquisition of Poland’s second largest cinema operator by number of screens, Multikino, in September 2013. Approximately 94% of Multikino’s cinemas are multiplexes and all are fully digital. In addition, we operate a 14-screen cinema in Dublin, Ireland and a 16-screen cinema in Taipei, Taiwan, each of which is a multiplex cinema and has stadium seating. We also recently signed a sale and purchase agreement for The Space, Italy’s largest cinema operator by admissions and GBOR, operating 36 multiplex cinemas with 362 fully digital screens. We expect The Space Acquisition to close on or about the Issue Date. On a pro forma basis, assuming The Space Acquisition had occurred on August 30, 2013, our Adjusted EBITDA for the 52 weeks ended August 28, 2014 would have been £99.6 million.

In Poland, Multikino is the second largest cinema operator as measured by number of screens. According to Dodona Research, in the United Kingdom, total market GBOR grew from approximately £944 million in 2009 to approximately £1,083 million in 2013. According to IBOE/Rentrak, GBOR declined to £694.1 million in the thirty-four weeks ended August 28, 2014 (a decrease of 4.2% compared to the corresponding period in 2013). In Germany, according to Dodona Research, total market GBOR grew from approximately c976 million in 2009 to approximately c1,023 million in 2013. According to IBOE/Rentrak, GBOR declined slightly to c589.7 million in the eight months ended August 31, 2014 (a decrease of 3.2% compared to the corresponding period in 2013). According to Dodona Research, in Poland, total GBOR decreased from approximately PLN 681 million in 2009 to approximately PLN 665 million in 2013. According to Boxoffice.pl, GBOR recovered to PLN 458.0 million in the thirty-five weeks ending September 4, 2014 (an increase of 4.2% compared to the corresponding period in 2013). Despite recent declines in total market GBOR in the United Kingdom, Germany and Poland, we believe these markets should continue to grow and provide opportunities for increasing our revenue. In Italy, The Space is the second largest cinema operator, in terms of GBOR, and total market GBOR in Italy decreased from c664.1 million in 2009 to c646.3 million in 2013, according to Dodona Research. Our operations in multiple attractive European markets provide us with certain economies of scale and the benefits of operating leverage across markets. We believe our multi-territory presence across these markets mitigates film revenue fluctuations and improves our negotiating position with our key commercial counterparties, including film distributors, concessions suppliers, landlords, technology providers and advertisers who we believe consider us a valuable and important partner. We believe that our established relationships have enabled us to secure commercially attractive contract terms with leading international suppliers. For example, in 2013, we extended our relationship with Sony Digital Cinema outside of the United Kingdom to Germany and Denmark, where they have provided their 4K digital technology to our CinemaxX cinemas. In addition, we have recently completed an international tender to leverage our European size to get the best possible lamp pricing, and we are currently in the middle of an international tender for 3D glasses across all territories. We are now Sony Digital Cinema’s largest customer outside of the United States. We believe the available choices, flexibility and caliber of our commercial partners enhance our consumer offering, brand image and positioning.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475
887,Offerings 2014.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.2,"Conveniently Located, High Quality Venues and Modern, State-of-the-Art Cinema Facilities","We believe our cinemas are well-located to maximize potential admissions. For example, we estimate that over 65% of the population in the United Kingdom lives within a 30-minute drive of a Vue cinema. We also have cinemas in the United Kingdom that are situated in flagship commercial locations with high foot fall, such as Westfield London, Westfield Stratford City and Leicester Square. In Germany, our cinemas are typically situated in premium city center locations within the 20 largest German cities where population densities are highest. In Poland, Multikino has four sites in densely populated Warsaw, with a total of 16 sites in the 10 most populous cities in Poland, based on Poland Central Statistical Office population data as of December 31, 2013. The Space has cinemas in the Northern, Central and Southern regions of Italy. Approximately three-quarters of its box office revenues were generated in Northern and Central Italy in 2013. The Space has cinemas in many of Italy’s major cities and conurbations, including Rome, Milan, Naples, Florence, Bologna, Parma, Bari and just outside of Venice. We believe that we operate one of the most modern and technologically advanced cinema portfolios in Europe. In the United Kingdom, 98.8% of our cinemas are multiplexes, which allows for greater film flexibility in terms of time, format and selection and provides certain cost efficiencies as employee staffing per screen in multiplexes is typically lower as compared with non-multiplex cinemas. In the United Kingdom, 95.9% of our screens have stadium seating that provides unobstructed views of the screen, and all of our cinemas are fully digital, providing consistent presentation quality to customers and greater flexibility in terms of content for cinema operators. Across the Group, 97.3% of our cinemas are multiplexes and 97.6% of our screens have stadium seating. In addition, we believe that the average age of our cinemas in the United Kingdom is lower than that of our primary competitors. In the United Kingdom, a fiber roll-out is currently underway that will connect all sites with high capacity links to improve resilience and speed, in order to support the processing of customer transactions and exchange of corporate data. There are no current plans to deliver films via this network. In Germany, we have continued to invest in refurbishment in recent years and, in July 2013, completed the process of upgrading all of our German cinemas to 4K digital projection technology. In the United Kingdom, we also have developed a proprietary premium large format screen, Vue Xtreme, which allows us to show large-screen content without paying royalties and licensing fees for alternative branded large-screen technology. We are in the process of replacing our current 3D equipment supplier RealD with 2 ----- Sony 3D and Masterimage in the United Kingdom and Germany. This will allow us to own our 3D equipment rather than leasing it from a third party which will be more cost effective for the Group. The Space cinemas are fully digitalized, and as of June 30, 2014, 94% of its cinemas are multiplexes, 99% of its cinemas have stadium seating and 40% of its screens are 3D-enabled.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475
887,Offerings 2014.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.3,Proven Operational Excellence,"We apply a rigorous and analytical approach to our cinema operations where we focus on revenue enhancement and cost optimization. For example, we constantly review our ticket pricing structure and believe we have been able to increase our box office revenue in our cinemas in the United Kingdom through changes to our pricing strategy, such as the introduction of ‘‘peak’’ and ‘‘off-peak’’ pricing and the introduction of our ‘‘Super Tuesday’’ offer. Our pricing strategy also entails increasing pricing flexibility by cinema location based on variables including time of day, day of the week and type of customer for each film, resulting in ticket price increases in certain circumstances and in increased use of discounts in others. We aim to maximize revenue by offering premium propositions, such as VIP seating, for customer segments that value these elements while selectively using discounts, such as ‘‘Kids AM’’ to drive admissions volume. These strategies have positively impacted our average ticket price. We also analyze film scheduling in order to deliver the ‘‘right’’ film, on the ‘‘right’’ screen at the ‘‘right’’ time in order to achieve optimal attendance. We systematically test our film scheduling changes, which have driven increases in our admissions and box office revenue while decreasing variable staff costs as compared to a control group of our cinemas. We have also improved our cost structure by applying certain management principles and practices across our business and our newly acquired companies when integrating them into the Group. For example, we have applied a disciplined approach to our cost components by employing competitive tendering processes for both capital expenditures and for supply costs. We also seek to manage our staff costs in order to match, to the extent possible, staffing levels with admissions levels. We also renegotiate our lease costs where possible and have achieved cost savings at certain sites in the United Kingdom, Germany and Poland. We have also invested in energy savings initiatives to reduce electricity and other utility costs across our cinemas in all territories as well as optimizing costs by leveraging our pan-European platform to establish strong relationships with key suppliers such as Sony Digital Cinema. For the 52 weeks ended November 28, 2013, our capital expenditures were £22.3 million (net of landlord contributions, including two months of Multikino). We expect capital expenditures in 2014 to be less than £30 million (net of landlord contributions, including the full year effect of Multikino) and in 2015 to be less than £38 million (net of landlord contributions, including The Space). We believe a significant portion of our capital expenditure investments is discretionary.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475
887,Offerings 2014.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.4,Track Record of Profitable Growth,"We have grown our cinema portfolio through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions across geographies. Since November 2005, we have developed 21 new cinemas with 200 screens in the United Kingdom. We believe we have been able to maximize operating results in terms of total admissions, average ticket price, concession spend per person and return on investment by strategically selecting the ‘‘right’’ place, building the ‘‘right’’ size and paying the ‘‘right’’ rent for our new builds. For example, our cinemas range from larger cinemas such as Vue Stratford City in London, which is a 17-screen, 63,500 square-foot, state-of-the-art multiplex as part of an approximately £1.5 billion commercial development project for the 2012 London Olympics, to smaller cinemas such as Vue Halifax, which is a 9-screen, 27,100 square-foot cinema located within an approximately £55 million mixed use development project in Halifax town center. As a result of this rigorous approach to capital expenditure, during the period from 2006 through 2013, we have progressively reduced the average number of years to pay back our initial investment in new cinema developments. In Italy, we believe our acquisition of The Space will bolster our growth track record, as The Space’s admissions market share grew by 5.3% between 2010 and 2013, according to Dodona Research. We have extensive experience and a successful track record of value accretive acquisitions. These acquisitions have allowed us to consolidate in our existing markets and expand into new markets in Europe that are attractive because they remain fragmented and have significant growth potential. We believe our selective and disciplined approach to acquisitions has resulted in tangible operating performance gains for our acquisitions. We apply strict criteria when evaluating target acquisitions, which need to demonstrate 3 ----- clear financial and strategic logic in terms of payback targets and investment hurdles, and a potential for operational improvement and accelerated growth.

Cinema operators are an integral component of revenue generation for film distributors. According to the British Film Institute 2013 Statistical Yearbook, approximately 27% of a film’s total revenue in the United Kingdom is earned in cinemas. According to the National Association of Theatre Owners, the amount of time a film is exclusively licensed for cinematic display prior to licensing for other distribution channels has generally stabilized over the last five years leading to a more stable and predictable revenue stream. Furthermore, a successful cinema release supports a film’s revenue generation in channels after its initial theatrical release, such as DVD, Blu-ray, pay-per-view and cable. We believe attending the cinema remains one of the most popular and affordable out-of-home entertainment options for consumers. The market has been relatively resilient even during economic downturns. For example, based on GDP data from the IMF and GBOR data from the Cinema Exhibitors’ Association and the Germany Federal Film Board, as real GDP decreased in the United Kingdom and Germany, respectively, between 2007 and 2009, GBOR increased over the same period in both these markets. We believe our conveniently located, state-of-the art cinemas, as well as our strong market positions in the United Kingdom, Germany and Poland, have enabled us to maintain stable and consistent cash flows in those markets. In addition, we offer premium propositions to customers, such as VIP seating, 3D and our premium large format screens, Vue Xtreme, to generate revenue, while selectively using discounts to drive admissions volume. As a result, our average admissions levels and average ticket prices have remained relatively stable, including during the most recent economic downturn. In Italy, upon completion of The Space Acquisition, we plan to introduce VIP seating and certain concession offerings, including pick-and-mix confectionary, in addition to pricing initiatives, customer relationship management (‘‘CRM’’) improvements and utility efficiencies.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

We believe this has been a key strength in the past and we plan to continue to extend these best-practices to our acquired cinemas in Germany, Denmark, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania and, upon completion of The Space Acquisition, Italy. We will continue to focus on our operational strengths where historically we have been successful. For example, in 2012, in order to improve film scheduling, we analyzed and identified key drivers and conducted controlled scheduling trials at 24 cinemas in the United Kingdom for nine weeks. As a result, we were able to implement strategic changes that increased admissions and revenue at these cinemas while decreasing variable staff costs. We then rolled out these film scheduling strategies throughout our United Kingdom cinemas, and in 2014, we have been conducting further film scheduling improvement trials in both the United Kingdom and Germany to help us deliver the ‘‘right’’ film, on the ‘‘right’’ screen, at the ‘‘right’’ time, which we believe will help us to increase profitability. We believe this analytical testing approach to film scheduling should allow us to continue to increase profit across all of our operations. In Poland, we are implementing strategic trials to test the success of VIP seating and the Xtreme premium large-screen format. We have also reviewed the capital expenditure involved in planned new site developments in Poland, which have resulted in improvements in the projected returns on these new sites. We are also implementing new approaches to film scheduling in Poland, which we believe will increase revenues as we will be able to schedule films during optimal time slots. In Italy, upon completion of The Space Acquisition, we plan to implement a number of operational improvements, including adding VIP seating and occupancy controls for air conditioning units in certain sites. We also intend to continue to apply a disciplined approach to all of our cost components. We have controlled our costs through a combination of competitive tendering processes, for both capital expenditures and for supply costs, which we intend to apply across our entire cinema portfolio. For example, we have recently begun to renegotiate leases to reduce property occupancy costs which will help us secure tenancy at key sites that are expected to deliver good long-term revenue generation. We also plan to continue our flexible staffing strategy to adjust employee-related costs in response to variations in admissions levels and to continue to invest in energy savings initiatives to reduce electricity and other utility costs across our cinemas. We also plan to renegotiate lease terms to reduce rental costs where possible. We believe we can continue to apply these costs strategies across our historical cinema portfolio and implement these practices across our acquired cinemas.

We plan to pursue growth opportunities from our existing cinemas by attracting new customers and maximizing revenue from existing customers, opening new cinemas in the near term. We will also continue to evaluate and pursue selective acquisitions, such as The Space Acquisition. We seek to provide a wide range of customer propositions from value offers to premium offers in order to both attract new customers and maximize revenue from existing customers. We plan to continue to deliver an innovative cinema experience, with packaged, branded and tailored offerings supported by high quality standards that drive and protect revenue streams. For example, in the United Kingdom, we have ‘‘Kids AM’’ for children as well as ‘‘Over 18s Screenings’’ for adults. We also intend to continue screening film and alternative content to improve utilization generally in periods of low film demand and to provide unique content offerings for customers, such as opera, concerts, ballet and sporting events, such as the 2014 FIFA World Cup, at premium pricing levels. We are also working on implementing CRM initiatives across our markets through which we will target promotions and marketing to customers based on their past cinemagoing and purchasing activities to ensure a tailored cinema experience for our customers. We believe a key component in customer choice is having easily accessible cinema locations with good public transport links and plentiful car parking. In our new sites, we seek to develop cinemas in locations with complementary services, such as in retail malls with restaurants and other leisure activities. We actively monitor new cinema developments and maintain a shortlist of potential locations. We are also investigating the feasibility across all markets of developing smaller multiplexes in areas with catchments of less than 5 ----- 100,000 people. In the 52 weeks ended November 29, 2013, we opened five new sites, totalling 36 screens. In the 52 weeks ended August 28, 2014, we opened four new sites totaling 31 screens. We intend to continue to apply rigorous analytics of local catchment population, propensity to visit the cinema, income levels and local competition to ensure each cinema’s configuration closely matches market capacity of the catchment area. We also believe that our experiences managing landmark cinemas, such as Westfield London, Westfield Stratford City and Leicester Square, and our experience in lease negotiation and capital expenditure control should enable us to minimize development costs to achieve superior payback periods on new cinemas. We will continue to seek value-enhancing growth based on disciplined and sustainable strategies, including the careful evaluation, selection and pursuit of strategic opportunities throughout Europe. As with our acquisitions in the United Kingdom, Germany, Poland and Italy, we may seek to acquire cinema operators in Europe or elsewhere where we believe we can realize attractive returns on investment and generate significant free cash flow.

We seek to continue to differentiate our cinema experience by expanding and improving our customer propositions. In addition to location and price, we believe that customers also choose cinemas based on the quality of the cinema experience. We are focused on creating a consistent brand image, synonymous with a state-of-the-art cinematic experience. We are also focusing on customer satisfaction in terms of ease of booking tickets, premium viewing options and offering a wide range of concessions. As the film industry produces franchise blockbusters that take advantage of premium formats such as 3D, we believe we can gain customers with our modern, state-of-the-art stadium-seated cinemas with digital technology such as Sony Digital Cinema 4K, which differentiates our cinema offering from less modern cinemas. We plan to continue to provide 3D formats and Vue Xtreme, which has premium large format screens and enhanced sound systems and have completed our digital investment with Sony Digital Cinema to provide 4K technology to our customers in Germany and Denmark. We are also currently considering the opportunity to introduce IMAX screens into certain of our cinemas in the United Kingdom, Germany and Denmark during 2015. We also plan to continue our emphasis on customer choice in terms of pricing, film selection and amenities. For example, we intend to continue offering across our cinema portfolio premium pricing options such as VIP seating where customers can enjoy larger, more luxurious seating in prime locations in the auditorium, as well as customer discount propositions such as ‘‘Kids AM’’ and ‘‘Super Tuesday’’ offers in the United Kingdom. In addition, we intend to continue to offer customer propositions like internet booking and mobile applications that allow customers greater flexibility and ease in purchasing their tickets across our cinemas. We plan to continue to emphasize customer satisfaction and focus on training and motivating our employees to provide an exceptional cinema experience. For example, we have cinema incentive plans that reward employees based on cinema profitability and customer service standards. We also provide our cinema employees with a modular training program that covers all aspects of running a cinema, including cinema management, in order to provide better customer service. Additionally, in order to gain critical customer insight, we employ a number of internal and external sources that provide detailed pictures of customer behavior, trends and attitudes. Listening to customers and understanding their behavior is core to our ability to deliver successful new offers, enhance existing offers and to better predict demand in the future. We actively track customer service metrics to check we are delivering high quality service to our customers with our friendly and helpful staff.

Funds for the acquisition were provided by the existing investors and new investors. Following this acquisition, SBC changed its name to Vue Entertainment and became the operator of the second largest cinema chain by number of screens in the United Kingdom. The combined 400-screen state-of-the-art stadium seating multiplex cinema portfolio including the flagship Leicester Square cinema was fully rebranded as ‘‘Vue’’ within six months. The Vue portfolio continued to grow both organically and through a series of acquisitions including the acquisition of Ster Century in 2005, which at the time operated the highest grossing cinema in the United Kingdom and Ireland at the Liffey Valley Shopping Centre in Dublin. In 2006, we completed a management buyout backed by Bank of Scotland Integrated Finance and simultaneously acquired the five cinemas we had been managing under contract for Village Roadshow. Between 2006 and the end of 2010, we developed an additional 14 cinemas in the United Kingdom, adding 133 screens to the portfolio and acquired Hoyts’ 6-screen Wood Green cinema, bringing our portfolio to 70 cinemas and 679 screens. Between 2010 through 2012, we achieved several significant milestones including opening two market leading cinemas in London, our 14-screen cinema at Vue Westfield London in 2010 and our 17-screen cinema at Vue Westfield Stratford City in 2011, which, according to IBOE/Rentrak, were the number one and four cinemas, respectively, in the United Kingdom for the 52 weeks ended August 28, 2014, as measured by GBOR.

The proceeds that Midco lent to the Issuer pursuant to the Bridge Loan Agreement were advanced to Midco from Finco pursuant to an intercompany loan in connection with the issuance of the Bridge Loan Notes. The Bridge Loan Notes are 11% fixed rate unsecured notes issued by Finco to the AIMCo Entities and OMERS Entities. As of 28 August 2014, the principal and accrued interest on the Bridge Loan Notes was £38.1 million. The Intercreditor Agreement and Indenture permits payments to be made by the Issuer in respect of the Bridge Loan to the extent such payments are permitted or not prohibited under the RCF Facility Agreement and the Indenture, subject to a maximum payment of £38.0 million for principal and accrued interest. As part of the Transactions, the initial Bridge Loan amounting to £34.1 million will be repaid by the previously restricted German Restricted Cash, and interest on the Bridge Loans amounting to £3.9 million will be repaid using internally generated funds. After this repayment an as-adjusted Bridge Loan balance of £89,000 will remain outstanding as of August 28, 2014. The amount of £38.0 million that will have been repaid to the AIMCo Entities and OMERS Entities, pursuant to repayment of the Bridge Loan Notes, will be reinvested by these entities as a New Issuer Loan to fund The Space Acquisition. See ‘‘Certain Relationships _and Related Party Transactions — Bridge Loan and — New Issuer Loan.’’_ As part of the Transactions, in addition to the drawings to partially fund the acquisition (see ‘‘Use of _Proceeds’’), we may draw under the Revolving Credit Facility to manage seasonal working capital_ requirements which are expected to reverse in the fourth quarter of 2014. The amount drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility will change depending on the level of cash and debt at the closing of The Space Acquisition, which is due to take place before or on November 25, 2014, pursuant to The Space Acquisition Agreement.

These measures are prepared by management because we believe they provide a view of our recurring operating performance that is unaffected by our capital structure and allows management to readily view operating trends and identify strategies to improve operating performance. Our use of each of these measures is as follows: - We define EBITDA as our consolidated loss on ordinary activities before taxation, adjusted for interest receivable and similar income, interest payable and similar charges, depreciation and amortization. - We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, adjusted to remove the effect of certain non-recurring or non-cash items which we believe are not indicative of our underlying operating performance and to reflect certain cost savings that we would have realized if we had adopted certain 3D technology (that we expect to adopt in the future) in historical periods, in locations where our current 3D technology licenses have expired or will expire in the next 24 months. - We define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of turnover. - We define EBITDAR as EBITDA, adjusted for rent expense on land and buildings (including turnover rent and rent-free adjustments). - We define Adjusted EBITDAR as Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted for rent expense on land and buildings (including turnover rent and rent-free adjustments). The EBITDA measures presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. We encourage you to review our financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure. See ‘‘Presentation of Financial and _Other Information — Other Financial Measures’’ for an explanation of certain limitations to the use of these measures._ (8) The following table presents a reconciliation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDAR and Adjusted EBITDAR information to our loss on ordinary activities before taxation for the periods presented.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

(h) Represents the strategic decision to purchase certain digital equipment related to the projection of 3D films, expected to result in significant savings in costs. We currently have license arrangements on rolling five year terms and where such licenses have terminated or will terminate within the next 24 months, we have added back the associated costs as we consider such cases to be non-recurring. In connection with our strategic decision to purchase certain digital equipment related to projection of 3D films, we estimate that we will incur capital expenditures amounting to approximately £2.9 million over the next 24 months in relation to licenses that have terminated or will terminate in the next 24 months. (i) Represents the non-cash share based compensation charge relating to the grant of class D ordinary shares in Holdco to employees in return for services rendered to the Issuer. We recognise the fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair value of the class D ordinary shares, over the vesting period, as an increase to staff costs. (j) Represents one-time VAT credits received from HMRC in relation to sales of certain concession items, net of associated legal fees. (k) Represents a non-cash provision for onerous leases at three previously discontinued CinemaxX sites in 2014 (Hamm, Rosenhoff and Mannheim) and UK sites in 2013. (l) Represents one-time site abandonment and pre-opening costs. (9) Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA represents the Issuer’s Adjusted EBITDA for the 52 weeks ended August 28, 2014, as adjusted to give pro forma effect to The Space Acquisition (which is expected to close prior to the end of November 2014) and the Multikino Acquisition, which occurred on September 30, 2013. Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA therefore gives effect to the acquisitions of Multikino and The Space as if they had occurred on August 30, 2013. The Estimated Adjusted EBITDA of The Space is derived from the underlying books and records of The Space which are maintained in accordance with IFRS. It should also be noted that U.K. GAAP differs in certain respects from IFRS and therefore the Estimated Adjusted EBITDA of The Space does not give effect to the differences between U.K. GAAP and IFRS. These differences could be material to Estimated Adjusted EBITDA of The Space, and as as a consequence, to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA.

The figures in the above table presented herein are for informational purposes only. This information does not represent the results we would have achieved had the acquisition of The Space occurred on August 30, 2013. The calculation of Estimated Adjusted EBITDA of The Space is based in part on management judgment of The Space with respect to certain costs and expenses which are considered non-recurring and the unaudited management information and books and records of The Space. These numbers have not been audited or reviewed by our independent auditors or the independent auditors of The Space. The Estimated Adjusted EBITDA of The Space is included in this offering memorandum as we believe it provides a useful measure of our results of operations after giving effect to the results of The Space; however, this information does not constitute a measure of financial performance under U.K. GAAP or IFRS and should not be considered a substitute for operating profit, net profit, cash flow or other financial measures computed in accordance with U.K. GAAP or IFRS, or as a measure of our future results of operations or liquidity. Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may differ from the definition of Estimated Adjusted EBITDA used by The Space, and therefore these measures may not be comparable. Furthermore, other companies, including those in our industry, may calculate similarly titled financial measures differently from us. As all companies do not calculate these financial measures in the same manner, the presentation of each financial measure may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Results indicated by certain of these measures may not be realized, and funds depicted by certain of these measures may not be available for management’s discretionary use if such results are not realized. The Estimated Adjusted EBITDA for The Space is for the twelve months ended June 30, 2014. This period does not align with the period for our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA. This difference in periods is due to the different reporting periods for the Issuer and The Space. As a result of this difference, our Adjusted EBITDA and the Estimated Adjusted EBITDA for The Space may not be directly comparable. 24 ----- (10) Total _pro forma third party borrowings represents total current and non-current third party borrowings, adjusted for the Transactions, as described in the ‘‘Use of Proceeds’’ as if the Transactions had occurred on August 30, 2013.

887,Offerings 2014.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and the Industry,13.1.1,We depend on film production and performance.,"Our ability to operate successfully depends upon the availability, diversity, appeal and commercial success of films and on our ability to license films on favorable terms. We mostly license first-run films, the success of which depends in part on the marketing efforts of the major film studios. Our revenues may, therefore, be volatile and are dependent on the efforts of others, as well as on factors outside of our control. Poor box office performance or any disruption in film production, including by reason of a strike or a reduction in the marketing efforts of the major film studios, could adversely affect our business by resulting in fewer customers interested in the films we exhibit and reduced revenue. Conversely, the successful performance of films, particularly the sustained success of any one film may generate positive results for us during a specific fiscal period or year that may not necessarily be indicative of, or comparable to, our future results of operations. A change in the type and breadth of films offered by film studios, including whether 3D films are produced in the future, may also adversely affect cinema admissions and revenue. In addition, premium pricing on ticket sales including for 3D films, VIP seating and for premium screens such as our premium, large format screen Vue Xtreme, has become an important source of revenue for our cinemas. Our ability to charge premium pricing similarly depends on the quality and breadth of films available. 3D films may not maintain their current levels of popularity in the future, and we may not be able to maintain a VIP seating or premium screen pricing strategy, as customers may not continue to perceive that VIP or other premium seating or the value of viewing a film in 3D outweighs the incremental cost.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

The film distribution business is highly concentrated and dominated by the major Hollywood film studios, with a number of smaller film distributors also operating in the markets in which we have a presence. Film distributors license films to cinema operators, including us, on a film-by-film and cinema-by-cinema basis. Consequently, we cannot guarantee a supply of films by entering into long-term arrangements with major film distributors, but must discuss and agree supply on a film-by-film basis. The cost of each film, the date we can debut each film at our cinemas and the date we must stop running each film are subject to the agreement we are able to negotiate with each film distributor. Furthermore, film distributors determine the timing of releases, which may either result in limited content during certain periods, or the commercial underperformance of individual films as a result of other competing films being released or other events being held during the same period. Our business, therefore, particularly depends on maintaining good relations with these major film distributors, as this affects our ability to negotiate commercially favorable terms for first-run films. Our business also depends on smaller film distributors including those that distribute locally produced content in our markets, particularly in Italy, Poland and Germany. Our business may be adversely affected if our access to films is limited or delayed because of deterioration in our relationships with one or more film distributors or for some other reason. These factors have had and may continue to have the ability to impact our results of operations during specific reporting periods. To the extent that we are unable to license a popular film for exhibition in our cinemas or are not able to negotiate favorable terms or reach an agreement on terms for the exhibition of films, including films that are expected to be popular across a wide range of audiences, our business, results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

Competitors may be national, regional or independent cinema 26 ----- operators and may have more resources with which to compete. In the United Kingdom, we operate in a relatively consolidated market with two primary competitors, Cineworld and Odeon. In contrast, the German cinema market is more fragmented, with the top three market players, Cinestar, CinemaxX and UCI Kinowelt, comprising in total less than a quarter of screens in 2013. Similar to the United Kingdom market, the Polish market is relatively consolidated with the three significant market players, Cinema City, Multikino and Helios, operating the majority of multiplexes. Similar to the German market, the Italian market is relatively fragmented, with the top three operators, The Space, Odeon UCI and Giometti accounting for less than a quarter of screens in 2013, according to Dodona Research. Outside of the top five operators, small independent operators account for over three-quarters of screens, according to Dodona Research. We also compete with other, smaller multiplex operators and independent operators across all of our markets. Competition among cinema companies is often intense with respect to the following factors: Attracting customers:_ The competition for customers is dependent upon factors such as the location (including the size and demographics of the catchment area) and number of cinemas, screens and seating capacity in a given market, the type of screens (including 3D or premium large format screens (equivalent to our Vue Xtreme screens)), pricing, the popularity of films screened, film showtime availability, customer service quality and the comfort and quality of the cinemas, including quality of projection and sound equipment. Our competitors have sought to increase the number of screens that they operate, program films differently or use pricing or promotions to attract customers away from our cinemas. Acquiring attractive cinema sites:_ We compete with other cinema operators and other businesses in our efforts to locate and acquire attractive sites for our cinemas. Competitors have built or may be planning to build cinemas in certain areas where we operate, which could result in excess capacity and increased competition for customers. Competition for new and desirable sites is intense and we cannot prevent competing cinema operators from opening cinemas that may reduce our attendance levels. Acquiring cinemas:_ We also anticipate significant competition from other cinema operators and financial buyers when trying to acquire cinemas, and we may be unable to acquire such cinemas at reasonable prices or on favorable terms. Moreover, some of these possible buyers may be stronger financially than we are. In addition, given our size and geographical presence, we may be required by competition regulatory authorities to dispose of cinemas in connection with any future acquisitions that we make. As a result of the foregoing, we may not succeed in acquiring cinemas or may face the prospect of having to purchase cinemas on comparatively unfavorable terms. Licensing films:_ We believe that the principal competitive factors with respect to film licensing include licensing terms, number of screens available for a particular picture, revenue potential, the location and condition of an operator’s cinemas and demographics. Cinema operators with operations in more markets than us may be able to leverage their scale to obtain more favorable terms than those which we can obtain. If we are unable to compete with our competitors for any of the above or other reasons, our business, results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affected.

If these activities improve in value, frequency or attractiveness, the share of the public’s leisure time and disposable income spent at the cinema may decrease and, as a result, our admissions and revenue from ticket sales may be negatively impacted, especially in years with high-profile sporting and other public events. For example, in summer 2014, our results of operations during the summer season were adversely impacted by the 2014 FIFA World Cup. We also compete with other film delivery methods, including network, rental, cable and satellite television, in-home television (2D and 3D), DVDs and Blu-ray, video-on-demand, pay-per-view services, streaming and downloads via the Internet. Competition from Internet downloads and streaming may increase as broadband technology improves, downloading speeds increase and the offerings of Internet streaming providers such as Netflix, Amazon and iTunes become more appealing, and if the window between a film’s exclusive release in cinemas to its release in alternative delivery formats shortens or becomes 27 ----- non-existent. See ‘‘— Our results of operations may be impacted by shrinking film release windows and the increasing popularity of alternative, real-time entertainment options, including Internet streaming.’’ An increase in the popularity of these alternative film delivery methods and other forms of entertainment such as an increase in the time spent on the Internet, whether on gaming, shopping or other pastimes, could reduce admissions at our cinemas, limit the prices we can charge for admission and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, an increase in the availability or popularity of pirated films, including through illegal Internet downloads and streaming, counterfeit DVDs or other forms of piracy, may result in film studios reducing their investment in films, resulting in the release of fewer films and lower quality films with less commercial appeal or the use of alternative delivery channels such as digital downloads, which could adversely affect our admissions and, as a result, our business, results of operations or financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

Generally, the most commercially successful films have been released during holiday periods, especially the summer and around the Christmas holidays. The unexpected emergence of a commercially successful film during other periods or the failure of an expected success at a key time could alter this trend. The timing of film releases have had and will likely continue to have a significant effect on our results of operations, and the results of one period are not necessarily indicative of results for the next period or for the same period in the following year. We expect fluctuations due to the variable nature of film production and release, but unexpected events can have a significant impact on our cash flow, as we are subject to events beyond our control, such as distribution release schedules, weather conditions and competing events. Title-by-title success of films at the box office can be highly unpredictable. Unexpected results may disrupt our projected cash flow significantly. In addition, certain weather conditions or forecasts can reduce significantly the number of people who go to the cinema. During times of extreme weather conditions, such as winter snow storms or summer heat waves, the number of people who decide to go to the cinema could reduce significantly. For example, the United Kingdom experienced unusual weather patterns during the course of our 2013 financial year which adversely impacted our admissions and revenue. In addition, the UK experienced severe and widespread flooding in Spring 2014, which impacted admissions. Similarly, admissions in Poland in the third quarter of 2014 decreased, partly as a result of a heat wave in July and August. Our business may also be affected by social, political, cultural or other events. For example, the rioting which took place in London and other United Kingdom cities in the summer of 2011 led to lower admissions and revenue than we have historically experienced during the summer period. Road closures or the reduced availability of public transport also has the ability to adversely impact admissions. If any of these factors were to materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

See ‘‘The Transactions — The _Space Acquisition.’’ A component of our overall operating strategy is the careful evaluation, selection and_ pursuit of strategic opportunities throughout Europe, including acquisition of cinema operators. In considering any acquisition, we expect to benefit from operational improvements and cost savings through, for example, the rollout of our best practices to our acquired cinemas and the increased leverage in supplier negotiations that typically arises from increased size.

Since November 2005, we have opened 21 new cinemas with 200 screens in the United Kingdom. The availability of attractive site locations for our cinemas is subject to various factors that are beyond our control. These factors include: - local conditions, such as scarcity of space or increase in demand for real estate, demographic changes and changes in planning laws; and - competition for site locations from other cinema companies and from other businesses. In addition, we typically require two to three years from the time we identify a site to the opening of the cinema. Construction of new cinemas could result in cost overruns, delays in the timetable or unanticipated expenses related to planning or other laws. Developers may have difficulty in obtaining financing for new 29 ----- developments. We are currently working with our development partners to construct new cinema developments. These developments may fail to compete or generate the results anticipated. Furthermore, although our management team carefully monitors new site development and selects locations for new cinema builds as part of its ongoing strategy, these new cinema sites may not perform to our expectations, due to factors such as location selection, deterioration of markets in which new cinemas are located or unexpected competition in new markets as a result of new cinemas, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations or financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

In the United Kingdom, we completed our conversion to digital-based media in August 2012. In Poland, digitalization was completed in 2011. In Italy, digitalization was completed in October 2012, and in Germany and Denmark, digitalization was completed in July 2013. Expected performance and operating benefits associated with the conversion to digital-based media may not be realized, leading to decreased earnings, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The industry is at different stages in adjusting to the conversion from celluloid-based media to digitalbased media. There are a variety of constituencies associated with this change that significantly impact industry participants, including content providers, film distributors, equipment providers and cinema operators. To help finance the cost of conversion to digital projection, film distributors pay virtual print fees to cinema operators (or third-party intermediaries) based on films presented on approved digital projection platforms. Generally, film distributors continue to pay virtual print fees after a cinema has converted to digital projection until a cost recoupment date or threshold has been reached. Multikino continues to receive virtual print fees directly from film distributors, while in the United Kingdom and Germany virtual print fees are paid to third party intermediaries. After completion of The Space Acquisition, The Space will continue to receive virtual print fees directly from film distributors. These payments may not be received, and recovery of the costs associated with digitalization may not occur. Delayed or non-recovery of the full amount of these costs may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our digital projector contracts are subject to complex contractual obligations, such as maintaining projectors to strict technical specifications, training our staff to operate the projectors, taking action to protect digital content from piracy and theft and various accounting and reporting requirements. If we fail to comply with our contractual obligations, the content providers may withdraw their support. Additionally, if we fail to adequately protect film content from piracy, we may be subject to litigation from film content providers. Furthermore, technology providers may not continue to supply digital projectors in the future and we may not have access to adequate capital to finance the technology purchases. Additionally, digital-based media is a relatively new technology. Our digital projectors or the cinema management systems associated with the digital projectors may break down and lead to a disruption in film exhibition. Isolated incidents of film disruption may lead to customer dissatisfaction. Larger scale technology problems may affect either a particular cinema or a particular piece of equipment common at many of our cinemas. A large scale breakdown in technology could have a material adverse impact on our admissions, on the continuing financial support for digital transformation by the content providers, on our results of operations, on our financial condition and on our industry reputation. We rely on external suppliers for maintenance and repair of our digital projectors, and we cannot guarantee that maintenance will be performed in a timely or effective manner, which may lead to delayed film showings and, as a result, reputational harm.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

Advertising sales are affected by levels of admissions and overall advertising market trends. In the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy, we experience a significantly higher profit margin on advertising sales, particularly on screen advertising, than on box office receipts or concession sales. In Poland, this margin is lower since advertising sales are dealt with in-house. Currently, the majority of our screen advertising arrangements are with Digital Cinema Media (‘‘DCM’’) in the United Kingdom, WerbeWeischer GmbH & Co. KG (‘‘WerbeWeischer’’) in Germany, Multikino Media in Poland and PRS Srl (‘‘PRS’’) in Italy. In previous years, our screen advertising arrangements included minimum guarantees which transferred the risk associated with declines in the screen advertising market to the intermediary and protected our screen advertising revenues. None of the contracts with DCM, WerbeWeischer or PRS provide for minimum guarantees, and there is no minimum guarantee between Multikino and Multikino Media. A decline or fluctuation in the screen advertising market would affect our ability to generate revenue through screen advertising sales. Additionally, we show alternative content, such as sporting and cultural events and provide alternative uses of our cinemas for meetings or other corporate events.

The scope of such regulation includes infrastructure, employment and operational issues relating to cinemas, as well as safety and security requirements. We cannot fully anticipate all changes that might be made, in the future, to laws and regulations, nor the possible impact of all such changes, and our ability to conduct our business is dependent on our ability to maintain authorizations, licenses and certificates. We are routinely audited to ensure compliance with all cinema and retail operation requirements, including compliance with age restrictions as dictated by film ratings that are determined by film classification authorities. Our licenses may not be renewed or we may fail to pass all audits in the future. If we fail to pass such audits or if we are found to be in breach of regulations applicable to us, we could face fines, revocation of operating licenses, adverse publicity or closure of our cinemas, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

In addition, demographic changes and competitive pressures have caused, and may in the future cause, some of our cinemas to become unprofitable. As a result, we may choose to close certain cinemas, pay lease termination charges or recognize impairment losses related to the decrease in value of particular cinemas. We review long-lived assets, including intangibles, for impairment as part of our financial year-end process and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. We continually monitor the performance of our cinemas, and factors such as changing consumer preferences for filmed entertainment and our inability to sublease vacant space could negatively impact operating results and result in future closures, sales, dispositions and significant cinema and other closure charges prior to expiration of underlying lease agreements. We have a significant amount of goodwill from acquisitions, amounting to £734.5 million as of August 28, 2014. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at the end of the first full financial year following acquisition and in other periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment by computing the fair value of a reporting unit and comparing it with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value a goodwill impairment is recorded. Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value. Management’s fair value estimates are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples. Declines in our attendance due to increased competition in certain regions or countries, or economic factors that lead to a decline in attendance in any of our markets could negatively affect our estimated fair values and could result in further impairments of goodwill. We also have tradename intangible assets. Tradename intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be fully recoverable. We estimate the fair value of our tradenames by applying an estimated market royalty rate that could be charged for the use of our tradename to forecasted future revenue, with an adjustment for the present value of such royalties. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, the tradename intangible asset is written down to its estimated fair value. Significant judgment is involved in estimating market royalty rates and long-term revenue forecasts. Management’s estimates are based on historical and projected revenue performance and industry trends. Deterioration in the performance of our cinemas could require us to recognize additional impairment losses and we may choose to close cinemas in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of our operations or financial condition.

We may be unable to respond to or invest in changes in technology and the technological preferences of our customers. For example, some of our competitors have invested in a greater number of 3D-capable screens, and if consumer preferences were to change rapidly in favor of 3D films, we may not be able to compete with other cinema operators. We have recently chosen to replace our current RealD 3D equipment with competitive 3D offerings from Masterimage and Sony 3D, and we expect the equipment conversion to take place over time, between 2014 and 2018, as our licenses with RealD expire. RealD have patents pending in Europe on their technology, and the granting of these patents may result in patent infringement claims against Masterimage by RealD.

Rent increases may adversely affect our earnings. Certain of our leases permit the landlord to terminate the lease if there is a default under the lease, including, for example, our failure to pay rent, service charges, insurance or applicable taxes in a timely fashion. Additionally, in Poland, in certain circumstances, the leases can be terminated by the bankruptcy administrator after the landlord’s bankruptcy. If a landlord were to terminate one of our leases, this would halt our operations at that cinema and could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, in Germany, certain of our leases require us to give bank guarantees as collateral to landlords. Any disputes that may result from such a termination may be expensive to pursue and may divert money and management’s attention from our other operations and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. If we decide to close certain cinema sites, we would still be liable in respect of all obligations under the leases for those sites. The majority of our cinemas are held pursuant to leases with long terms which cannot be terminated early by the tenant. Under most of these leases, we are not permitted to terminate the lease even if we cease operating the cinema because it is not profitable. We expect additional cinemas that we may acquire in the future to be subject to similar long-term, non-terminable leases. If we decide to close an existing or future cinema, we may be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease which would include, among other things, payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term, which would reduce our profitability and limit our ability to expand in other locations. The majority of our sites are leased from third parties for a fixed term although some leases incorporate contractual rights to extend the lease term. At the end of the lease term or any lease extension, if applicable, we may be unable to renew the lease without substantial additional cost, if at all. If we are unable to renew our leases, we may be forced to close or relocate a cinema, which could subject us to construction and other costs and risks, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. For example, closing a cinema, including during the time of relocation, will reduce the amounts that the cinema would have contributed to our revenue. Additionally, revenue and profit, if any, generated at a relocated cinema may not equal the revenue and profit generated at the existing cinema.

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, only the Security Agent has the right to enforce the Security Documents relating to the Collateral on behalf of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests in the Collateral and be barred from taking enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee who will (subject to the provisions of such Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent. In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests is subject to mandatory provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the Collateral are taken. For example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for the appropriation of certain pledged assets, but require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. There is some uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the Notes that are not identified as registered holders in a security document will be validly secured. With respect to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests and the enforceability of such security interests in certain jurisdictions, including Germany, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of ‘‘parallel debt’’ obligations in favor of the Security Agent (‘‘Parallel Debt’’) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors towards holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture (‘‘Principal Obligations’’). The pledges in such jurisdictions are granted to the Security Agent as security interests for the Parallel Debt and will not directly secure the Principal Obligations. The Parallel Debt will be at all times in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations. Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. In respect of the security interests granted to secure the Parallel Debt, the holders of the Original Notes do not, and the holders of the Additional Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Security Agent.

The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens, loss of legal perfection and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the first-ranking liens can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or recharacterization under English law.

For example, the Security Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party (including, without limitation, relevant governmental agencies, e.g., relevant competition authorities) to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents from relevant third parties.

The applicable hardening period for these new security interests can run from the moment each new security interest has been granted, perfected or recreated.

Payment of interest and repayment of our indebtedness, including under the Notes, will be wholly dependent on the ability of our subsidiaries to make such cash available to us, by either dividend distributions or intercompany loans, or both. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may be restricted by the terms of their existing or future indebtedness or by law, in their ability to make such dividend distributions or advance upstream loans to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness, including the Notes. Each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. While the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement limit the ability of our subsidiaries to incur contractual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us, these limitations are subject to certain significant qualifications and exceptions. We cannot assure you that arrangements with our subsidiaries, the funding permitted by the agreements governing existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries and our results of operations and cash flow generally will provide us with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans to fund payments on the Notes. In the event that we do not receive distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on the Notes.

For example, our principal shareholders could vote to cause us to incur additional indebtedness, to sell certain material assets or make dividends distributions, in each case, so long as the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement so permit. The interests of our principal shareholders could conflict with interests of holders of Notes, particularly if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due. Our principal shareholders could also have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings, dividend distributions or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investments although such transactions might involve risks to the holders of Notes.

If a change of control were to occur, we cannot assure you that the Issuer would have sufficient funds available at such time to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or our other then-existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A change of control may result in an event of default and/or mandatory prepayment obligation under, or acceleration of, our Revolving Credit Facility, the Notes and other indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and other indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from its subsidiaries to allow it to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a change of control may be limited by our then existing financial resources. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a change of control occurs at a time when our subsidiaries are prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, our subsidiaries may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we expect that we would require third party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Indenture and certain other indebtedness. See ‘‘Description of the Notes — Change _of Control.’’_ The change of control provisions contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring or other similar transactions involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a ‘‘change of control’’ as defined in the Indenture. Except as described under ‘‘Description of the Notes — Repurchase at the Option of _Holders — Change of Control,’’ the Indenture will not contain provisions that would require the Issuer to offer_ to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, recapitalization or similar transaction. The definition of ‘‘change of control’’ in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase ‘‘all or substantially all,’’ there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the Issuer’s assets and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

Generally, claims of creditors (both secured and unsecured) of a non-Guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors of the subsidiary, will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the non-Guarantor subsidiary over the claims of creditors of its parent entity. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization or other bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of any of these non-Guarantor subsidiaries, the holders of their 45 ----- indebtedness and their trade creditors will generally be entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of those non Guarantor subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution.

However, the Indenture provides that each Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor without rendering the relevant Guarantee, as it relates to that Guarantor, voidable or otherwise ineffective or limited or in breach of restrictions under applicable law, and enforcement of each Guarantee would be subject to certain generally available defenses. See ‘‘Limitations on _Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.’’_ Enforcement of any of the Guarantees against any Guarantor will be subject to certain defenses available to or restrictions imposed on Guarantors in the relevant jurisdiction and contractual limitations reflecting such defences or restrictions. Although laws differ among these jurisdictions, these laws and defenses generally include those that relate to corporate purpose or benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, financial assistance, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. If one or more of these laws and defenses are applicable, a Guarantor may have no liability or decreased liability under its Guarantee depending on the amounts of its other obligations and applicable law. Limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of any Guarantee against any Guarantor. Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and other laws, a court could (i) avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee, (ii) direct that the holders of Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantee to the relevant Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors or (iii) take other action that is detrimental to you, typically if the court found that: - the relevant Guarantee was incurred with actual intent to give preference to one creditor over another, hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or, in certain jurisdictions, when the granting of the Guarantee has the effect of giving a creditor a preference or when the recipient was aware that the Guarantor was insolvent when it granted the relevant Guarantee; - the Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value or corporate benefit for the relevant Guarantee and the Guarantor was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Guarantee; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Guarantee; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity; - the relevant Guarantee was held to exceed the corporate objects of the Guarantor or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor; or - the amount paid or payable under the relevant Guarantee was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law. These or similar laws may also apply to any future guarantee granted by any of our subsidiaries pursuant to the Indenture. We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was ‘‘insolvent’’ at the relevant time or that, regardless of the method of the valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor was insolvent on the date its Guarantee was issued, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds. 46 ----- The liability of each Guarantor under its Guarantee is limited to the amount that will result in such Guarantee not constituting a preference, fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. However, it is uncertain what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor. There is a possibility that the entire Guarantee may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. If a court decided that a Guarantee was a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance and voided such Guarantee, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, you may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and, if applicable, of any other Guarantor under the relevant Guarantee that has not been declared void. In the event that any Guarantee is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent the agreed limitation of the Guarantee obligations apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, and if we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes or any Guarantee is found to be a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. The payment of dividends or principal and interest on the intercompany loan to the Issuer will reduce the distributable profits and reserves available to satisfy the obligations under the Guarantees and Security Documents. We are under no obligation to maintain a specific level of distributable profits and reserves, and, if we have distributable profits and reserves, we may make dividend payments or payments of principal and interest on the intercompany loan that reduce our distributable profits and reserves to zero. We intend to make dividends and enter into intercompany loans to service indebtedness and for tax planning purposes. We may not have distributable profits and reserves available to satisfy the obligations under the Guarantees and Security Documents, whether or not we distribute dividends or enter into intercompany loans. The payment of dividends or principal or interest on the intercompany loan to service our debt obligations (including under the Notes) will deplete the distributable reserves available to satisfy the obligations under the Guarantees. In addition, the payment under the Guarantees and the enforcement of security interests under the relevant Security Documents may require certain prior corporate formalities to be completed, including, but not limited to, obtaining an audit report, shareholders’ resolutions and board resolutions.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

Substantially all of the directors and executive officers of the Issuer are non-residents of the United States. Although the Issuer has submitted to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on these directors and executive officers. In addition, as all the assets of the Issuer and its subsidiaries and those of its directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce judgments obtained in the U.S. courts against them. Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Issuer may not be subject to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters with England and Wales.

In addition, the enforcement in England and Wales of any judgment obtained in a U.S. court based on civil liabilities, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, will be subject to certain conditions.

On March 24, 2014, the Council of the European Union adopted a Council Directive amending and broadening the scope of the requirements described above. Member States are required to apply these new requirements from January 1, 2017. The change will expand the range of payments covered by the Directive, in particular to include additional types of income payable on securities. The Directive will also expand the circumstances in which payments that indirectly benefit an individual resident in a Member State must be reported. This approach will apply to payments made to, or secured for, persons, entities or legal arrangements (including trusts) where certain conditions are satisfied, and may in some cases apply where the person, entity or arrangement is established or effectively managed outside of the European Union. For a transitional period, Luxembourg and Austria are required (unless during that period they elect otherwise) to operate a withholding system in relation to such payments. During that transitional period, withholding will not apply under the Directive to a payment if the beneficial owner of the payment authorizes exchange of information instead. The changes referred to above will broaden the types of payments subject to withholding in those Member States which still operate a withholding system when they are implemented. In April 2013, the Luxembourg Government announced its intention to abolish the withholding system with effect from 1 January 2015, in favor of automatic information exchange under the Directive.

These operations also included our Portuguese business until we ceased operations on July 7, 2014. In operational terms, our Irish business is managed and operated as part of our U.K. business, but as a euro-denominated territory, Ireland is included within Continental Europe for accounting and financial purposes; and - other markets, which represents our business in Taiwan.

887,Offerings 2014.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.1,Overview,17.1.3,,"We believe we are Europe’s third largest cinema operator by number of screens with operations predominantly in the United Kingdom, Germany and Poland. We have grown our portfolio through a combination of new cinema developments and acquisitions of cinemas in the United Kingdom and internationally. We currently operate 150 cinemas with 1,359 screens located across eight countries, and upon completion of The Space Acquisition, we will operate 186 cinemas with 1,721 screens located across nine countries. We believe our cinema portfolio in the United Kingdom represents the newest, most modern chain of cinemas in the country. In the United Kingdom, 98.8% of our cinemas are multiplexes, 95.9% have stadium seating that provides unobstructed views of the screen and all are fully digital. In the United Kingdom, all of our cinemas use Sony Digital Cinema 4K digital projection technology, which provides four times the resolution of 2K digital projectors. We have a broad reach in the United Kingdom and we estimate that over 65% of the population lives within a 30-minute drive of a Vue cinema. According to IBOE/Rentrak, our GBOR market share in the United Kingdom was approximately 23.4% for the 52 weeks ended November 28, 2013 and 22.8% for the 39 weeks ended August 28, 2014. We operate five of the top 20 grossing box office cinemas in the United Kingdom, with a strong presence in the key London and West End markets, including our Westfield London site which was the highest grossing box office cinema in the United Kingdom for the 52 weeks ended November 28, 2013 and the 39 weeks ended August 28, 2014. We have leveraged our strong operational knowledge and experience with successful integrations of acquisitions to enter new European markets through selective strategic acquisitions of leading cinema operators. These European markets are generally more fragmented and less developed than the United Kingdom and we believe they offer opportunities for consolidation and growth. In August 2012, we established our presence in Germany and Denmark through the acquisition of CinemaxX, Germany’s second largest cinema operator by number of screens (excluding Cineplex Group, a co-operative of independent operators) currently and at the time of the acquisition of CinemaxX. Our cinemas in Germany are typically situated in premium city center locations within the 20 largest German cities where population densities are highest. We believe that all of our German cinemas offer state-of-the-art facilities; for example, all of our cinemas in Germany have 4K digital projection technology. We also recently expanded into Poland, Latvia and Lithuania through the acquisition of Poland’s second largest cinema operator by number of screens, Multikino, in September 2013. Approximately 94% of Multikino’s cinemas are multiplexes and all are fully digital. In addition, we operate a 14-screen cinema in Dublin, Ireland and a 16-screen cinema in Taipei, Taiwan, each of which is a multiplex cinema and has stadium seating. We also recently signed a sale and purchase agreement for The Space, Italy’s largest cinema operator by admissions and GBOR, operating 36 multiplex cinemas with 362 fully digital screens. We expect The Space Acquisition to close on or about the Issue Date. 60 ----- On a pro forma basis, assuming The Space Acquisition had occurred on August 30, 2013, our Adjusted EBITDA for the 52 weeks ended August 28, 2014 would have been £99.6 million.

The timing of such film releases has had, and is expected to continue to have, a significant effect on our results of operations, and the results of one quarter are therefore not necessarily indicative of results for the next quarter or for the same period in the following year. Weather._ Weather and weather forecasts also influence attendance levels and directly affect our turnover. In general, rainy or otherwise inclement weather tends to positively impact admissions, unless the inclement weather is extreme, which tends to lead to reduced admissions. The onset of sunny weather after a gloomy period can reduce attendance for a short period of time, as some potential customers pursue outdoor leisure activities instead of visiting the cinema. For example, according to the Met Office, the 2014 winter (December 2013 to February 2014) was the wettest in the United Kingdom since national records began in 1910. This was also the stormiest period of weather experienced by the UK for at least 20 years (with 12 major winter storms), with a number of areas impacted by sustained periods of flooding, although admissions decreased only slightly during this period as a result of a strong film slate (see ‘‘Principal factors affecting _results of operations and financial performance — Film Quality and Success’’). Furthermore, the positive or_ negative impact of weather on attendance can be magnified if the relevant weather coincides with the opening weekend of a significant release, as a substantial portion of a film’s box office revenue is typically earned in its opening weekend. Competing entertainment or unexpected events._ Major social, political, cultural or sporting events impact our turnover to the extent that they reduce total admissions. Although film distributors attempt to take such events into account when scheduling film releases, the specific timing of major events can still have an impact on total admissions. For example, the 2014 FIFA World Cup took place this year from June 12, 2014 to July 13, 2014 and led to a reduction in admissions in our cinemas for the duration of the tournament. Additionally, the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games that took place in London, where we generate a significant portion of our turnover, led to a reduction in admissions in London and other cinemas for the duration of the Games. The rioting that took place in London and other U.K. cities during the summer of 2011 also led to lower attendance and turnover than would otherwise have been expected during the summer season.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

Concession revenue is impacted by the types and length of films which we play, the exhibition format and general economic conditions. For example, in some geographic markets, longer films are shown with intermissions, which generally benefits concession sales. In addition, we believe certain types of films, for example superhero films such as Captain _America: The Winter Soldier, X-Men: Days of Future Past or_ _Guardians of the Galaxy, generally attract_ customers who are more likely than others to spend on concessions. We believe that price conscious customers who purchase discount tickets are also more likely to spend less on concessions. General economic conditions are also a factor as these conditions impact consumer spending patterns, including the proportion of customers who are attracted to discount tickets. Although attendance levels have remained relatively stable, including during the most recent economic downturn, concession volumes across the industry appear to have been adversely affected as consumers have less discretionary income due to the current economic climate. The cost of sales we incur for concession sales varies by product type, but in general concession revenue tends to have strong margins. Historically, we have sought to manage our concessions costs by negotiating prices for our products directly with suppliers in each market, although our multi-territory presence now provides the opportunity to leverage our scale and negotiate more cost-effective deals. 63 -----",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

Screen advertising revenues are generally more directly correlated to the overall economic environment as compared to, for instance, admission volumes.

In addition to the average ticket prices achieved by a given film, a film’s profitability for us also depends on the margins we achieve between tickets sold and the film rental costs we pay to distributors. The film license agreements we negotiate with distributors are the single largest component of our expenses, and are negotiated on a film-by-film basis, and as a result the percentage of box office revenue that is paid to film distributors will vary, depending on the expected quality of the film and the period during which it is shown in our cinemas. Certain of our expenses vary, according to total admissions and levels of box office revenue. Our film rental costs, for example, are calculated with reference to box office revenue, and therefore a significant portion of our costs tends to decrease during periods of low admissions. We also manage our staff costs in order to match, to the extent possible, staffing levels with admissions levels. For example, we have the ability to reduce the operating hours of our cinemas during quiet periods, thus reducing staff costs and utility costs. We also have the ability to manage discretionary costs, such as marketing, non-essential expenses and supplies, and the timing of certain repair and maintenance expenses, so that these cost outlays are in line with admission volumes. Certain of our expenses do not vary with admissions or box office revenues. For example, property rentals (excluding turnover rents), depreciation and amortization are generally costs that are not influenced by changes in levels of admissions or box office revenues. We endeavor to mitigate the risk to financial performance from low attendance by generating revenues from non-film sources such as screening of alternative content and hiring our facilities for conferences. In addition, we apply a rigorous approach to property management so as to optimize our negotiation of rents, property leases and costs of new cinema sites.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

As a result, our reported results of operations and financial condition are affected by exchange rate fluctuations due to both transaction and, more significantly, translation risk. See ‘‘Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business and the Industry — Fluctuations in exchange rates may _adversely affect our results of operations.’’_ Transaction risk arises when our subsidiaries execute transactions in a currency other than their functional currency, however. On a consolidated basis, we consider the Group’s transaction foreign exchange risk to be low, primarily because each of our geographic segments receive revenue and incur most expenses in their functional currencies, and thus benefit from a natural hedge. Our operations in Poland, Latvia and Lithuania are subject to higher transaction risk as a result of receiving revenue in złoty, lats and litas, respectively, while paying property rental costs in euros. Translation risk arises because the Group prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in pounds sterling whereas our subsidiaries operating outside the United Kingdom prepare their financial statements in currencies other than pounds sterling. We are therefore exposed to translation risk on the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements when we translate the financial statements of our subsidiaries which have a functional currency other than pounds sterling. Translation risk in our operations to date has exposed us to fluctuations in the value of pounds sterling as compared to the euro, Polish złoty, Latvian lats and Lithuanian litas and, to a limited extent, against the Taiwanese new dollar and Danish Krone. Given our increasing focus 64 ----- on markets outside the United Kingdom, we expect the translation effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our reported results of operations to increase over time. We do not currently hedge our foreign currency exposure other than by the natural hedge provided by having debt denominated in both pounds sterling and euros.

(7) Calculated as total concession revenue for the period, as consolidated at VEIL (net of VAT), divided by total admissions in the period. (8) Presented as the number at period end. _Average Ticket Prices_ Our ticket pricing levels vary by cinema location and other variables including time of day, day of the week and type of customer for each film, resulting in higher ticket prices in certain circumstances and in increased use of discounts in others. Premium offerings in the United Kingdom, such as VIP seats, Vue Xtreme screens and 3D film offerings also serve to increase average ticket prices. While targeted discounts such as ‘‘Super Tuesdays,’’ ‘‘Orange Wednesdays’’ and the ‘‘Kids AM’’ programs reduce average ticket prices, we believe these discounts boost total admissions volume and therefore overall box office revenue. Premium offerings in Germany such as surcharges for 3D films, longer films and blockbusters, plus seat location surcharges, have also served to increase average ticket prices. CinemaxX generally benefits from German cinemas having higher average ticket prices than in the United Kingdom, and as a result our group average ticket price increased following the acquisition of CinemaxX in August 2012. Multikino has lower average ticket prices than the rest of the Group and, as a result, the increase in overall Group average ticket price facilitated by the CinemaxX Acquisition has been slightly offset by the Multikino Acquisition. The film slate of available movies in a given period also affects our box office revenue and average ticket prices through variations in the mix of different ticket types sold. Certain films tend to attract an adult audience that will purchase higher-priced adult tickets, whereas other films are intended for children or seniors, whose tickets are sold at a discount as compared to standard adult tickets. Certain films are also more likely to be shown in formats which enhance turnover, such as 3D or Vue Xtreme. _Total Admissions_ Our total admissions are substantially affected by the quality and success of the films we offer, and seasonal and other factors, each as explained further in the factors below. The number of cinemas and screens we operate also affects our total admissions. We have increased the number of cinemas and screens we operate from 66 cinemas featuring 643 screens as of November 28, 2008 to 150 cinemas featuring 1,359 screens as of August 28, 2014. We have achieved this growth organically by opening ten new cinemas with 102 new screens since November 28, 2008 and through acquisitions, of Apollo (which ultimately added a net nine cinemas and 56 screens) and CinemaxX (which added 33 cinemas and 282 screens) and, most recently, Multikino (which added 30 cinemas and 246 screens). Since we acquired Multikino, it has subsequently opened a further four new sites with 31 screens. This increase in the number of cinemas and screens has contributed to growth in our total admissions from 38.7 million for the 52 weeks ended November 25, 2010 to 53.9 million for the 52 weeks ended November 28, 2013, which is largely attributable to our acquisitions of Apollo and CinemaxX during 2012 and Multikino in 2013. Upon the completion of The Space Acquisition, we will gain an additional 36 cinemas and 362 screens. _Film Quality and Success_ The unexpected emergence of a successful film, or the failure of an expected success, has led and can lead to volatility in our admissions and box office revenue across financial periods. Our results are therefore dependent on the film slate and popularity of the films released in a given period, which in turn depends on production from the movie industry and local content in each country, in addition to the movie industry and local content in Hollywood. Consequently, we are dependent upon the degree to which successful productions are released by major U.S. studios, the British film industry and the film industries in Germany, Poland and, upon completion of The Space Acquisition, Italy. For example, in the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012, a relatively poor summer period with a weak slate of films was followed by the release of 62 ----- the record-breaking Bond film Skyfall, which provided a strong end to the financial year. In 2013, in Germany, the German-language film Fack Ju Gohte also provided a strong end to the year.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

These acquisitions were financed by bridging loans of £16.5 million and c94.9 million (including the Doughty Hanson cash bridge mentioned below), plus a c90.0 million standalone term loan facility, all of which were repaid at the time of the refinancing of our bank loans on December 17, 2012 and upon completion of the Vue Acquisition, and the issuance of the Original Notes. Specifically: - effective May 10, 2012, we acquired Apollo Cinemas Limited in the United Kingdom, and we consolidated its results of operations into our financial statements as of the date of its acquisition. We currently operate nine of Apollo’s cinemas; - effective August 7, 2012, we acquired 30 cinemas in Germany and three cinemas in Denmark upon our purchase of a 91.34% stake in CinemaxX, Germany’s second largest cinema operator by number of screens currently and at the time of the acquisition of CinemaxX. We consolidated its results of 65 ----- operations into our financial statements as of the date of its acquisition. We now own 100% of CinemaxX following the Squeeze Out that was effected on February 12, 2014; - effective January 1, 2013, CinemaxX acquired a cinema in Raschplatz, Germany, which it had previously managed, adding 10 screens to our portfolio; and - effective September 30, 2013, we acquired Multikino, which now operates 34 cinemas in Poland, Lithuania and Latvia, and we consolidated its results of operations as of the date of its acquisition. Since acquiring Apollo, CinemaxX and Multikino, we have been actively integrating them into the existing corporate, operational and financial structures of Vue in order to share best practices and identify and realize synergies where possible. These integration initiatives relate to, among other things, our financial reporting procedures, property management and EBITDA-enhancing capital expenditure processes as well as overall cinema operations. Our consolidated profit and loss accounts for the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012 include the results of operations of Apollo and CinemaxX since their respective dates of acquisition, and our consolidated balance sheet at November 29, 2012 includes the financial position of Apollo and CinemaxX, respectively, in full. Additionally, our consolidated results for the 52 weeks ended November 28, 2013 reflect a full year of consolidated results of Apollo and CinemaxX and the partial results of Multikino from the date of its acquisition, which was September 30, 2013. As a result, our financial statements as of and for the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012 and the 52 weeks ended November 28, 2013 vary significantly from those of earlier periods. In addition, our results may be affected by other items, particularly our ability to realize synergies, including improved efficiencies at cinemas and roll-out of Vue’s best practices in relation to film scheduling and pricing across the larger group, reconfiguration of our newly acquired cinemas, reduction of central and administrative costs, and procurement synergies from expenditures on building multiplex facilities. As a result, due to the acquisitions of the Apollo, CinemaxX, Multikino and, upon completion of The Space Acquisition, The Space, our financial statements in the future will vary significantly from the historical Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this offering memorandum. Additionally, our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the 39 week period ended August 28, 2014 include the results of Multikino, whereas our comparative unaudited interim consolidated financial statements as of and for the 39 weeks ended August 29, 2013 do not. At the date of this offering memorandum, the acquisition accounting in respect of The Space Acquisition has not been completed, and therefore has not been reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Acquisition accounting will require us to determine the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the closing date of each acquisition, with the difference between the sum of these fair values and the cost of the acquisition being recognized as goodwill in our consolidated balance sheet. This valuation exercise in respect of The Space Acquisition may result in significant adjustments to the historical values of property, plant and equipment, other assets, liabilities and intangible assets, resulting in significant changes to depreciation and amortization expenses and to debt fees being written off in our profit and loss account.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

As of August 28, 2014, the Issuer’s third party borrowings were £540.0 million (excluding capitalized debt issuance costs and original issue discount). As a result of this increased level of third party borrowings resulting from the 2013 Transactions, the Issuer’s interest expense has increased and will increase further in future periods as a result of the Transactions. Accordingly, the Issuer’s financial results following completion of the Transactions may differ significantly from our previously reported financial results. As of August 28, 2014, the Issuer recorded debt issuance costs of £13.5 million (excluding original issue discount) in connection with the Original Notes Offering and the 2013 Revolving Credit Facility, which will be amortized over the period of the respective borrowings. As of August 28, 2014, 57% of the senior secured notes incurred under the Issuer’s financing arrangements in connection with the Vue Acquisition and Multikino Acquisition was denominated in pounds sterling and 43% was denominated in euros and other currencies.

As a result of this increase in third party borrowings, the Issuer’s interest expense will increase in future periods.

Turnover increased by £25.9 million, or 6.7%, to £415.2 million in the 39 weeks ended August 28, 2014 from £389.3 million in the 39 weeks ended August 29, 2013. This increase was entirely the result of the acquisition of Multikino in September 2013. Revenue increased as a result of increased admissions, despite a lower average ticket price and concession spend per person as Multikino has a lower average ticket price, a lower total concession spend per person, and a lower total revenue per person; consequently, the acquisition of Multikino resulted in a decrease in these metrics for the Group. Excluding the contribution from Multikino, turnover in our existing business in the United Kingdom and Continental Europe, decreased by £24.1 million, or 6.2%, to £365.2 million in the 39 weeks ended August 28, 2014 from £389.3 million in the 39 weeks ended August 29, 2013, principally due to a reduction in admissions resulting from a weaker film slate during the 39 weeks ended August 28, 2014, compared to a strong performance for films such as _The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,_ _Despicable Me 2 and_ _Les _Miserables during the 39 weeks ended August 29, 2013 and also due to the impact of the FIFA World Cup in_ June and July 2014, which had an adverse impact on admissions. Excluding the contribution from Multikino, concession revenues decreased as a result of lower total admissions, partially offset by increased concession spend per person, reflecting the continuance of pricing and operational initiatives across all markets. Advertising revenue in our existing business was flat, while other income decreased primarily as a result of a fall in corporate sales relating to the weak film slate in the 39 weeks ended August 28, 2014. _Segment analysis for the 39 week periods ended August 28, 2014 and August 29, 2013_ The following table sets forth turnover for our United Kingdom, Continental Europe and other markets segments in the 39 weeks ended August 28, 2014 and August 29, 2013.

Continental Europe turnover increased by £38.9 million, or 26.2%, to £187.6 million in the 39 weeks ended August 28, 2014 from £148.7 million in the 39 weeks ended August 29, 2013. This increase was entirely due to the acquisition of Multikino on September 30, 2013. Excluding turnover from Multikino, Continental Europe turnover in the existing business decreased by £11.1 million, or 7.5%, to £137.6 million in the 39 weeks ended August 28, 2014 from £148.7 million in the 39 weeks ended August 29, 2013, principally due to decreased admissions. Turnover from other geographical markets decreased by £0.6 million, or 9.4%, to £5.8 million in the 39 weeks ended August 28, 2014 from £6.4 million in the 39 weeks ended August 29, 2013, due to a decrease in admissions, average ticket price and concession spend per person in Taiwan. _Cost of Sales_ Cost of sales increased by £10.4 million, or 7.1%, to £157.3 million in the 39 weeks ended August 28, 2014 from £146.9 million in the 39 weeks ended August 29, 2013. This increase was primarily due to additional cost of sales from the acquisition of Multikino on September 30, 2013, which diluted our gross profit margin. Excluding the cost of sales from Multikino, cost of sales in our existing business decreased by £10.6 million, or 7.2%, to £136.3 million in the 39 weeks ended August 28, 2014, principally due to lower film rental costs, driven by lower total admissions and decreased box office revenue, as a result of a weaker film slate. _Administrative expenses_ Administrative expenses increased by £15.4 million, or 6.9%, to £239.4 million in the 39 weeks ended August 28, 2014 from £224.0 million in the 39 weeks ended August 29, 2013. This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Multikino on September 30, 2013. Excluding the administrative expenses from Multikino, administrative expenses in our existing business decreased by £7.2 million, or 3.2%, to £216.8 million in the 39 weeks ended August 28, 2014 from £224.0 million in the 39 weeks ended August 29, 2013, principally due to lower staff costs across our sites, as a result of lower admissions. _Interest Payable and Similar Charges_ Interest payable and similar charges decreased by £22.8 million, or 29.1%, to £55.5 million in the 39 weeks ended August 28, 2014 from £78.3 million in the 39 weeks ended August 29, 2013. This decrease in interest payable and similar charges was due primarily to the impact of the 2013 Financing which occurred in July 2013, when the senior facilities agreement dated November 7, 2010 between, among others, Vue Holdings (UK) Limited and Lloyds Bank TSB plc, as amended and restated, was refinanced at the level of the Issuer by way of the Original Notes, and as a result, the interest payable by VEIL during the 39 weeks ended August 28, 2013 was no longer being incurred by VEIL. _Tax charge_ Tax charge on ordinary activities decreased by £1.2 million, or 25.5%, to £3.5 million in the 39 weeks ended August 28, 2014 from £4.7 million in the 39 weeks ended August 29, 2013. This decrease in tax charge on ordinary activities was primarily the result of the impact on the Group’s results of a reduction in the effective tax rate on profits from Continental Europe operations. 71 -----",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

Turnover increased by £141.3 million, or 37.5%, to £518.2 million in the 52 weeks ended November 28, 2013 from £376.9 million in the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012. This increase was due primarily to a full year of turnover from CinemaxX and Apollo for the 52 week period ended November 28, 2013 and additional turnover from the acquisition of Multikino on September 30, 2013. The inclusion of CinemaxX and Multikino increased admissions by 12.4 million, which was partially offset by a reduction in admissions in the United Kingdom following the success of Skyfall in the prior period. CinemaxX had a higher average ticket price, concession spend per person and total revenue per person, and as a result, the full year inclusion of CinemaxX in the 52 weeks ended November 28, 2013 resulted in an increase in these metrics across the Group. Excluding the contribution from Multikino, turnover in our existing business increased by £128.1 million, or 34.0%, to £505.0 million in the 52 weeks ended November 28, 2013, principally due to a full year of turnover from CinemaxX, which delivered incremental revenue of £130.8 million.

This decrease was due primarily to a reduction in admissions following the success of Skyfall in the prior period, which was partially offset by an increase in average ticket price and a full year of turnover from Apollo. Continental Europe turnover increased by £142.7 million to £209.6 million in the 52 weeks ended November 28, 2013 from £66.9 million in the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012. This increase was due primarily to a full year of turnover from CinemaxX and the acquisition of Multikino on September 30, 2013. Excluding turnover from Multikino, Continental Europe turnover in the existing business, increased by £129.4 million to £196.3 million in the 52 weeks ended November 28, 2013 from £66.9 million in the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012, as a result of a full year of turnover from CinemaxX, which contributed 10.7 million additional admissions and a higher average ticket price. Turnover from other geographical markets increased by £1.2 million, or 17.9%, to £7.9 million in the 52 weeks ended November 28, 2013 from £6.7 million in the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012. This 73 ----- increase was a result of increased admissions, average ticket price and concession spend per person in Taiwan. _Cost of Sales_ Cost of sales increased by £53.2 million, or 37.9%, to £193.7 million in the 52 weeks ended November 28, 2013 from £140.5 million in the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012. This increase was due primarily to a full year of cost of sales from CinemaxX and Apollo and a partial year of cost of sales from Multikino. Concession cost of goods sold also increased due to the inclusion of a full year from CinemaxX and Apollo and a partial year of costs from Multikino after its acquisition on September 30, 2013. Concession cost of goods sold was flat in the rest of the business. _Administrative Expenses_ Administrative expenses increased by £89.2 million, or 40.8%, to £307.6 million in the 52 weeks ended November 28, 2013 from £218.4 million in the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012. This increase was due primarily to a full year of administrative expenses from Apollo and CinemaxX. Staff costs increased by £25.0 million, or 52.0%, to £73.1 million in the 52 weeks ended November 28, 2013 from £48.1 million in the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012. The average number of employees rose to 7,072 during the 52 weeks ended November 28, 2013 as compared to 3,940 during the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012. This was as a result of the Multikino acquisition and the full year impact of the acquisitions of Apollo and CinemaxX. These increases were partly mitigated by staffing efficiencies enabled by the digital screen roll-out in our existing business, which resulted in a decline in staff costs per admission as digital screens do not require projectionists. _Interest Payable and Similar Charges_ Interest payable and similar charges increased by £27.2 million, or 47.9%, to £84.0 million in the 52 weeks ended November 28, 2013 from £56.8 million in the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012. This increase was due primarily to the additional debt relating to the acquisition of CinemaxX. _Tax charge_ Tax charge on loss on ordinary activities increased by £0.5 million, or 19.2%, to £3.1 million in the 52 weeks ended November 28, 2013 from £2.6 million in the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012.

Turnover increased by £95.8 million, or 34.1%, to £376.9 million in the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012 from £281.1 million in the 49 trading weeks ended November 24, 2011. This increase was due primarily to additional turnover from the acquisitions of CinemaxX in August 2012 and Apollo in May 2012. The acquisition of CinemaxX resulted in increases to our average ticket price, total concession spend per person, and total revenue per person, as CinemaxX benefits from higher average prices than our existing business. Excluding the contributions from CinemaxX and Apollo, turnover in our existing business increased by £28.6 million, or 10.2%, to £309.7 million in the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012, principally due to an increase in box office revenue. This increase in box office revenue in our existing business primarily reflects attendance from a full 53 weeks of trading in the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012, compared to only 49 weeks of trading in the 56 weeks ended November 24, 2011 and the impact of opening Stratford in September 2011, which increased our screens by 17 and contributed an entire year of turnover in the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012. Box office revenue in our existing business also grew due to strong average ticket price growth resulting from our strategic pricing initiatives and customary price increases, and favorable movement from a reduced proportion of discount tickets. The increase in box revenue was partially offset by weaker summer admissions in 2012 as a result of an underperforming summer film slate (films such as John Carter and Battleship performed poorly) and lower demand during the London 2012 Olympics and Paralympics and the 2012 European football championship. Concession revenues in our existing business also increased in the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012, from a slight increase in total concession spend per person and the increase from 49 to 53 weeks of trading. Advertising revenue in our existing business also increased in the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012, due to the combined impact of Digital Cinema Media’s (‘‘DCM’’) conversion to digital operations and the impact of _Skyfall, which attracted significant advertising revenues, as well as the increase from 49 to 53 weeks of trading. 75 ----- _Segment analysis for the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012 and the 49 trading weeks ended November 24, 2011_ The following table sets forth turnover for our United Kingdom, Continental Europe and other markets segments in the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012 and the 49 trading weeks ended November 24, 2011:",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

Excluding turnover from Apollo from May 10, 2012, U.K. turnover in the existing business increased by £31.7 million, or 12.2%, to £291.7 million in the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012 from £259.9 million in the 49 trading weeks ended November 24, 2011, principally due to the reasons provided above. Continental Europe turnover increased by £52.6 million to £66.9 million in the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012 from £14.3 million in the 49 trading weeks ended November 24, 2011. This increase was due primarily to the acquisition of CinemaxX in August 2012. Excluding turnover from CinemaxX from August 7, 2012, Continental Europe turnover in the existing business, decreased by £2.9 million, or 20.6%, to £11.3 million in the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012 from £14.3 million in the 49 trading weeks ended November 24, 2011. Turnover from other geographical markets decreased by £0.2 million, or 2.9%, to £6.7 million in the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012 from £6.9 million in the 49 trading weeks ended November 24, 2011. _Cost of Sales_ Cost of sales increased by £40.6 million, or 40.6%, to £140.5 million in the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012 from £99.9 million in the 49 trading weeks ended November 24, 2011. This increase was due primarily to the increase in turnover from Apollo and CinemaxX, and Apollo and CinemaxX also incurred a higher cost of sales as a percentage of turnover than the existing business. Excluding the impact of Apollo and CinemaxX, cost of sales in our existing business increased as a result of organic growth in box office revenue due to the performance of certain films, such as Skyfall, which commanded a relatively high film rental cost, and higher 3D licensing fees resulting from increasing the number of 3D screens. Concession cost of goods sold also increased, as a result of higher concession sales. Another contributing factor to the increased cost of sales was the increase in the period from 49 to 53 trading weeks. _Administrative Expenses_ Administrative expenses increased by £52.4 million, or 31.6%, to £218.4 million in the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012 from £166.0 million in the 49 trading weeks ended November 24, 2011. This increase was due primarily to higher rentals under operating leases on cinema sites of £67.8 million, as compared to £49.2 million in the 49 trading weeks ended November 24, 2011, principally due to rental costs of Apollo and CinemaxX. Excluding the impact of Apollo and CinemaxX, administrative expenses in our existing business increased principally due to the increase in this period from 49 to 53 trading weeks. Also contributing to the increase in administrative expenses in our existing business was a higher level of depreciation on tangible fixed assets, principally relating to the larger network of cinemas and to upgrades at Vue’s U.K. cinemas. Depreciation increased to £30.2 million as compared to £24.9 million in the 49 trading weeks ended November 24, 2011. 76 ----- In addition, the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012 included a full year of property rental expense and operating costs for Westfield Stratford, which opened in September 2011. Staff costs increased by £11.9 million, or 32.9%, to £48.1 million in the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012 from £36.2 million in the 49 trading weeks ended November 24, 2011. The average number of employees rose to 3,940 during the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012 as compared to 3,267 during the 49 trading weeks ended November 24, 2011 as a result of the Apollo and CinemaxX acquisitions and opening Westfield Stratford. The increase in this period from 49 to 53 trading weeks also contributed to the increase in staff costs. These increases were partly mitigated by staffing efficiencies enabled by the digital screen roll-out in our existing business, which resulted in a decline in staff costs per admission as digital screens do not require projectionists. _Interest Payable and Similar Charges_ Interest payable and similar charges increased by £10.7 million, or 23.2%, to £56.8 million in the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012 from £46.1 million in the 49 trading weeks ended November 24, 2011. This increase was due primarily to the additional debt relating to the acquisitions of CinemaxX and Apollo plus interest payable on the existing shareholder loans, as well as the increase in the period from 49 to 53 trading weeks. _Tax charge_ Tax charge on loss on ordinary activities remained stable at £2.6 million in the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012 from £2.6 million in the 49 trading weeks ended November 24, 2011. An explanation of these charges may be found in note 9 of our audited consolidated financial statements for the 53 week period ended November 29, 2012.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475
887,Offerings 2014.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.25,Liquidity and Capital Resources,17.25.1,Overview,"Historically, our principal sources of liquidity have been cash flows from operating activities, which include revenues generated through box office admissions, concessions sales and screen advertising, sometimes supplemented by use of borrowings under our working capital facilities, including our Revolving Credit Facility. Our principal uses of cash are acquisitions, working capital, operating expenses such as property rent and staff costs, cinema improvements and other capital expenditures and debt servicing costs. Following the Transactions and the application of the proceeds therefrom, the Issuer’s debt service obligations will consist primarily of interest payments on the Notes and principal and interest payments on the amounts drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility. We believe that the Issuer’s available cash balances, combined with the Issuer’s cash flows from operating activities and borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility, will be sufficient to meet its expected general liquidity needs and debt service obligations for the next 12 months. However, the Issuer will be highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations, and we cannot provide assurance that the Issuer’s business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its liquidity needs, including making payments in the Notes or on other debt when due. The Issuer’s ability to generate cash from operations will depend on its future operating performance, which is in turn dependent on various factors, including but not limited to those described under ‘‘— Principal _factors affecting results of operations and financial performance,’’ many of which are beyond the Issuer’s_ control. Furthermore, the Issuer’s liquidity will also be affected by the quantity, quality and timing of film releases. For example, film distributors generally release the films which they anticipate will be the most successful during the summer and Christmas holiday seasons. Consequently, we have typically generated higher turnover during such periods. Furthermore, if the Issuer’s cash flow from operating activities is lower than expected, or the Issuer’s capital expenditure requirements exceed our projections, the Issuer may be required to seek additional financing, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. The Issuer’s ability to arrange financing generally and its cost of capital will depend on numerous factors, including general economic conditions, the availability of credit from banks, other financial institutions and capital markets, restrictions in the instruments governing the Issuer’s debt and its general financial performance. See ‘‘Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Financial Profile — Our substantial leverage and debt _service obligations could adversely affect our business and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations with respect to the Notes’’ and ‘‘— Risks Relating to Our Financial Profile — We require a significant amount of_ 77 ----- _cash to service our debt and sustain our operations. Our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors beyond our control, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our debt obligations, which may not always be successful.’’_ We maintain cash and cash equivalents to fund the day-to-day requirements of our business. We hold cash primarily in pounds sterling and euro. As of August 28, 2014, we had £52.8 million in gross cash in hand and at bank. This is unusually high as we have retained approximately £38 million to repay the majority of the Bridge Loan. As of August 28, 2014, we also had c5.2 million (£4.1 million) of cash in CinemaxX, which is restricted cash for rental deposits held in relation to certain of the Group’s cinema sites.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

Following the completion of the Transactions, the Issuer will continue to be highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations. As of August 28, 2014, on a pro forma basis for the Transactions, the Issuer would have had approximately £583.5 million of third party borrowings (which includes capitalized issue cost), of which approximately £586.3 million would have been represented by the Notes. We anticipate that the Issuer’s high leverage will continue for the foreseeable future. Following the Transactions, we expect that the Issuer’s principal sources of liquidity will be cash flow from operations, cash at bank and the Revolving Credit Facility.

The majority of our customers are members of the public visiting cinema sites, from whom cash is generally collected either on the day of their visit, or shortly thereafter through credit card settlements. Our short-term payables primarily relate to payments to film distributors, landlords for property rents, suppliers of concessions products, fixed asset suppliers and VAT. Our property rents in the United Kingdom are typically paid quarterly. Our short-term receivables include advertising income and are generally lower than our short-term payables. Our working capital is therefore generally a net creditor position. We have historically funded our peak working capital requirements through available cash balances, funds generated from our operations, and use of our working capital facilities.

(2) Covers the 56 weeks from the date of incorporation of VEIL to November 24, 2011, but of which only 49 weeks included trading results. (3) The data for VEIL for the 39 weeks ended August 29, 2013, 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012 and the 49 trading weeks ended November 24, 2011 does not include any amounts related to Multikino, which was acquired on September 30, 2013. The data for the 52 weeks ended November 28, 2013 include amounts relating to Multikino, effective from September 30, 2013. _Net cash inflow from operating activities_ Net cash inflow from operating activities consists of profit before interest and tax, as adjusted for changes in working capital and non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization. 78 ----- Net cash inflow from operating activities increased by £15.0 million, or 32.3%, to £61.5 million in the 39 weeks ended August 28, 2014 from £46.5 million in the 39 weeks ended August 29, 2013, mainly due to the inclusion of a full 39 weeks from Multikino in the 39 weeks ended August 28, 2014, as well as working capital fluctuations primarily due to increased film rental accruals in the 39 weeks ended August 29, 2013. These working capital fluctuations resulted from the film rental liabilities incurred in connection with the strong performance of Skyfall that were accrued as of November 29, 2012 but paid in 2013. Film rental accrual movements were more in line with our normal operations in the 39 weeks ended August 29, 2014. Net cash inflow from operating activities decreased by £8.9 million, or 14.4% to £53.1 million in the 52 weeks ended November 28, 2013 from £62.0 million in the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012. The decrease was primarily caused by the strong performance of _Skyfall, which resulted in higher film rental liabilities, which were accrued as of November 29, 2012 but paid in 2013, since film rental suppliers are paid after the film is shown which means that working capital will fluctuate with the quality of the film slate. This adverse working capital movement was only partly offset by the impact of Apollo and CinemaxX. Net cash inflow from operating activities increased by £31.3 million, or 102.0%, to £62.0 million in the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012 from £30.7 million in the 49 trading weeks ended November 24, 2011. The strong performance of Skyfall referred to above resulted in higher levels of accrued film rental liabilities at 29 November 2012 compared with the liabilities relating to films shown in November 2011. As a consequence net cash flows from operating activities increased primarily as the result of the acquisition of Apollo and CinemaxX, as well as the improved working capital movement on trade creditors within our existing business, and due to the presence of a full 53 weeks of trading in the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012, compared to only 49 weeks of trading in the period ended November 24, 2011. _Net cash outflow from returns on investments and servicing of finance_ Net cash outflow from returns on investments and servicing of finance consists of cash interest paid on our indebtedness, net of cash interest received on our cash and cash equivalents. Under our existing financing facilities, we can pay interest either monthly, quarterly or half-yearly. Therefore, the amount of interest paid on our existing facilities in any period depends on our choice of interest roll-up period. Net cash outflow from returns on investment and servicing of finance increased by £19.2 million to an outflow of £37.0 million in the 39 weeks ended August 28, 2014 from an outflow of £17.8 million in the 39 weeks ended August 29, 2013, primarily due to an increase in debt resulting from the Original Notes Offering. Net cash outflow from returns on investments and servicing of finance decreased by £5.1 million, or 21.3%, to an outflow of £18.9 million in the 52 weeks ended November 28, 2013 from an outflow of £24.0 million in the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012, primarily due to a seven-month interest payment falling due in the January 2014, compared to a three-month interest payment made prior to November 29, 2012. The decrease was partly offset by the higher interest and a syndicate waiver fee resulting from new financing facilities relating to the acquisition of Apollo and CinemaxX in the 39 weeks ended August 28, 2013. Net cash outflow from returns on investments and servicing of finance increased by £12.9 million, or 116.2%, to an outflow of £24.0 million in the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012 compared to an outflow of £11.1 million in the 49 trading weeks ended November 24, 2011. This increase was due to timing of interest payments, as described above. _Net cash outflow for capital expenditure and other financial investments_ Net cash outflow for capital expenditure and other financial investments consists of investments in subsidiaries, investments and disposals in property, plant and equipment and fixtures, disposals of real estate and other changes and disposals. See ‘‘— Capital Expenditures’’ below. Net cash outflow for capital expenditure and other financial investments increased by £5.4 million to an outflow of £22.6 million in the 39 weeks ended August 28, 2014 from an outflow of £17.2 million in the 39 weeks ended August 29, 2013 due primarily to the proceeds resulting from a sale of tangible assets during the 39 weeks ended August 29, 2013 that was not repeated in the 39 weeks ended August 28, 2014. This was partially offset by a reduction in investment in tangible fixed assets in 2014, compared to 2013, as capital expenditure in the 39 weeks ended August 28, 2014 principally related to investment in existing sites and other EBITDA-enhancing projects, whereas capital expenditure in the 39 weeks ended August 29, 2013 included additional new site development. 79 ----- Net cash outflow for capital expenditure and other financial investments decreased by £65.4 million, or 46.9%, to an outflow of £73.9 million in the 52 weeks ended November 28, 2013 from an outflow of £139.3 million in the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012. This decrease was primarily due to lower levels of investment in subsidiaries, the completion of the acquisition of 91.34% of the share capital of CinemaxX in August 2012, and in September 2013, a lower investment being required to acquire 100% of the share capital of Multikino. Net cash outflow for capital expenditure and other financial investments decreased by £326.5 million, or 70.1%, to an outflow of £139.3 million in the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012 compared to an outflow of £465.8 million in the 49 trading weeks ended November 24, 2011. This decrease was primarily the result of lower levels of investment in subsidiaries, following the December 2010 acquisition of Vue Entertainment Investment Limited. _Net cash inflow to/(outflow from) financing activities_ Net cash inflow/(outflow) from financing activities mainly consists of proceeds from borrowings, repayments from borrowings and settlement of derivatives, share repurchases and the issue of shares. Net cash inflow from financing activities increased by £13.6 million to an inflow of £0.4 million in the 39 weeks ended August 28, 2014 from an outflow of £13.2 million in the 39 weeks ended August 29, 2013 primarily due to the repayment of the CinemaxX loans and the payment of the bank fees relating to the acquisition of CinemaxX in the 39 weeks ended August 29, 2013. Net cash inflow from financing activities decreased by £114.0 million to £32.7 million in the 52 weeks ended November 28, 2013 from £146.7 million in the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012. This decrease was primarily the result of the repayment of bank loan facilities and loan notes in the 52 weeks ended November 28, 2013, in connection with the Vue Acquisition and the Original Notes Offering. Net cash inflow from financing activities decreased by £317.1 million, or 68.4%, to an inflow of £146.7 million in the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012 compared to an inflow of £463.8 million in the 49 trading weeks ended November 24, 2011. This decrease in inflow was primarily the result of new bank loan facilities and loan notes taken out in the 49 trading weeks ended November 24, 2011, partly offset by shareholder loans taken out to fund the purchase of Apollo and CinemaxX in the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

(5) The data for the 39 weeks ended August 29, 2013 do not include any amounts related to Multikino which was acquired on September 30, 2013. Our historical capital expenditure has related primarily to purchases of fixed assets, acquisition of assets used in cinemas, cinema refurbishment and other related costs. In the periods under review, our historical capital expenditure (excluding maintenance capex) has related primarily to: - the development of six new cinemas in the United Kingdom which were opened at Westfield Stratford, Halifax, Cramlington, Bicester, Glasgow Fort and Gateshead and the development of four cinemas in Poland at Lublin, Czechowice Dzjedzice, Katowicie and Olsztyn; - the full digital conversion of our United Kingdom and Irish cinemas, which began in June 2011 and was completed in summer 2012; - in Germany and Poland, initiatives to enhance certain cinemas and implement energy-saving projects; and - initiatives to increase admissions, such as building additional screens at the existing cinemas, and the installation of VIP seating. For the 52 weeks ended November 28, 2013, our capital expenditures were £22.3 million (net of landlord contributions, including two months of Multikino). We expect capital expenditures in 2014 to be less than £30 million (net of landlord contributions, including the full year effect of Multikino) and in 2015 to be less than £38 million (net of landlord contributions, including The Space). Across the Group, planned EBITDAenhancing capital expenditures include additional VIP seating, additional screens and energy-saving projects. We believe that a significant portion of our capital expenditure investments are discretionary.

We manage our net exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate financial debt and variable rate financial debt in our total financial debt portfolio. To manage this mix, we may enter into interest rate swap agreements, in which we exchange periodic payments based on a notional amount and agreed upon fixed and variable interest rates and into forward contracts, in which we exchange fixed amounts of foreign currency and fixed amounts of euro. Our financial liabilities issued at floating rates, including the floating rate notes issued as part of the Original Notes, will expose us to cash flow interest rate risk, while financial liabilities issued at fixed rates expose us to fair value interest rate risk. To manage the exposure to changes in interest rates and to lower the overall costs of financing, we will consider using interest rate swaps to exchange the interest rate exposure on a portion of the indebtedness from a floating interest rate to a fixed interest rate or from a fixed interest rate to a floating interest rate, as applicable. Such instruments may not cover our full exposure to interest rate risks. We will also consider hedging our obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, as appropriate.

Given our increasing focus on non-U.K. markets and the recent volatility of other currencies against pounds sterling, the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our reported 83 ----- results of operations could increase over time. Our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations is of several types, as summarized below: - Transaction risk arises when our subsidiaries execute transactions in a currency other than their functional currency. On a consolidated basis, we consider the Group’s transaction foreign exchange risk to be low, primarily as a result of the natural hedge of our foreign currency income and expenses. - Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in pounds sterling. We are therefore exposed to translation risk on the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements when we translate the financial statements of our subsidiaries which have a functional currency other than pounds sterling. A portion of our assets, liabilities, revenue and costs are denominated in various currencies other than pounds sterling, principally euro (from CinemaxX Germany operations, Portugal (through the site’s closure in July 2014) and Ireland and, from the completion of The Space Acquisition, from The Space operations in Italy), and in złoty, lats and litas from Multikino operations. As a result, our consolidated results of operations, which are reported in pounds sterling, are affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. During the 39 weeks ended August 28, 2014, we generated 48.9% of our revenue in pounds sterling, 37.6% in euro, 12.0% in złoty and 1.4% in other currencies.

These transactions could affect the comparability of our results between financial periods or result in changes to the carrying value of our assets, liabilities and shareholders’ equity.

We have grown our portfolio through a combination of new cinema developments and acquisitions of cinemas in the United Kingdom and internationally. We currently operate 150 cinemas with 1,359 screens located across eight countries, and upon completion of The Space Acquisition, we will operate 186 cinemas with 1,721 screens located across nine countries. We believe our cinema portfolio in the United Kingdom represents the newest, most modern chain of cinemas in the country. In the United Kingdom, 98.8% of our cinemas are multiplexes, 95.9% have stadium seating that provides unobstructed views of the screen and all are fully digital. In the United Kingdom, all of our cinemas use Sony Digital Cinema 4K digital projection technology, which provides four times the resolution of 2K digital projectors. We have a broad reach in the United Kingdom and we estimate that over 65% of the population lives within a 30-minute drive of a Vue cinema. According to IBOE/Rentrak, our GBOR market share in the United Kingdom was approximately 23.4% for the 52 weeks ended November 28, 2013 and 22.8% for the 39 weeks ended August 28, 2014. We operate five of the top 20 grossing box office cinemas in the United Kingdom, with a strong presence in the key London and West End markets, including our Westfield London site which was the highest grossing box office cinema in the United Kingdom for the 52 weeks ended November 28, 2013 and the 39 weeks ended August 28, 2014. We have leveraged our strong operational knowledge and experience with successful integrations of acquisitions to enter new European markets through selective strategic acquisitions of leading cinema operators. These European markets are generally more fragmented and less developed than the United Kingdom and we believe they offer opportunities for consolidation and growth. In August 2012, we established our presence in Germany and Denmark through the acquisition of CinemaxX, Germany’s second largest cinema operator by number of screens (excluding Cineplex Group, a co-operative of independent operators) currently and at the time of the acquisition of CinemaxX. Our cinemas in Germany are typically situated in premium city center locations within the 20 largest German cities where population densities are highest. We believe that all of our German cinemas offer state-of-the-art facilities; for example, all of our cinemas in Germany have 4K digital projection technology. We also recently expanded into Poland, Latvia and Lithuania through the acquisition of Poland’s second largest cinema operator by number of screens, Multikino, in September 2013. Approximately 94% of Multikino’s cinemas are multiplexes and all are fully digital. In addition, we operate a 14-screen cinema in Dublin, Ireland and a 16-screen cinema in Taipei, Taiwan, each of which is a multiplex cinema and has stadium seating. We also recently signed a sale and purchase agreement for The Space, Italy’s largest cinema operator by admissions and GBOR, operating 36 multiplex cinemas with 362 fully digital screens. We expect The Space Acquisition to close on or about the Issue Date. On a pro forma basis, assuming The Space Acquisition had occurred on August 30, 2013, our Adjusted EBITDA for the 52 weeks ended August 28, 2014 would have been £99.6 million.

We believe our diverse geographic presence positions us to take advantage of the stability of markets in Western Europe while also offering the ability to capitalize on growing markets in Eastern Europe. The majority of our existing cinemas are located in the United Kingdom, Germany and Poland, which are the largest, third largest and twelfth largest cinema markets in Europe by GBOR, respectively, as of 2013. Italy is the fourth largest cinema market in Europe by GBOR. We are one of the top three cinema operators in the United Kingdom by GBOR and the second largest cinema operator by number of screens in Germany.

According to Dodona Research, in Poland, total GBOR decreased from approximately PLN 681 million in 2009 to approximately PLN 665 million in 2013. According to Boxoffice.pl, GBOR recovered to PLN 458.0 million in the thirty-five weeks ending September 4, 2014 (an increase of 4.2% compared to the corresponding period in 2013). Despite recent declines in total market GBOR in the United Kingdom, Germany and Poland, we believe these markets should continue to grow and provide opportunities for increasing our revenue.

We believe our multi-territory presence across these markets mitigates film revenue fluctuations and improves our negotiating position with our key commercial counterparties, including film distributors, concessions suppliers, landlords, technology providers and advertisers who we believe consider us a valuable and important partner. We believe that our established relationships have enabled us to secure commercially attractive contract terms with leading international suppliers. For example, in 2013, we extended our relationship with Sony Digital Cinema outside of the United Kingdom to Germany and Denmark, where they have provided their 4K digital technology to our CinemaxX cinemas. In addition, we have recently completed an international tender to leverage our European size to get the best possible lamp pricing, and we are currently in the middle of an international tender for 3D glasses across all territories.

We also have cinemas in the United Kingdom that are situated in flagship commercial locations with high foot fall, such as Westfield London, Westfield Stratford City and Leicester Square. In Germany, our cinemas are typically situated in premium city center locations within the 20 largest German cities where population densities are highest. In Poland, Multikino has four sites in densely populated Warsaw, with a total of 16 sites in the 10 most populous cities in Poland, based on Poland Central Statistical Office population data as of December 31, 2013. The Space has cinemas in the Northern, Central and Southern regions of Italy. Approximately three-quarters of its box office revenues were generated in Northern and Central Italy in 2013. The Space has cinemas in many of Italy’s major cities and conurbations, including Rome, Milan, Naples, Florence, Bologna, Parma, Bari and just outside of Venice. We believe that we operate one of the most modern and technologically advanced cinema portfolios in Europe. In the United Kingdom, 98.8% of our cinemas are multiplexes, which allows for greater film flexibility in terms of time, format and selection and provides certain cost efficiencies as employee staffing per screen in multiplexes is typically lower as compared with non-multiplex cinemas. In the United Kingdom, 95.9% of our screens have stadium seating that provides unobstructed views of the screen, and all of our cinemas are fully digital, providing consistent presentation quality to customers and greater flexibility in terms of content for cinema operators. Across the Group, 97.3% of our cinemas are multiplexes and 97.6% of our screens have stadium seating. In addition, we believe that the average age of our cinemas in the United Kingdom is lower than that of our primary competitors. In the United Kingdom, a fiber roll-out is currently underway that will connect all sites with high capacity links to improve resilience and speed, in order to support the processing of customer transactions and exchange of corporate data. There are no current plans to deliver films via this network. In Germany, we have continued to invest in refurbishment in recent years and, in July 2013, completed the process of upgrading all of our German cinemas to 4K digital projection technology. In the United Kingdom, we also have developed a proprietary premium large format screen, Vue Xtreme, which allows us to show large-screen content without paying royalties and licensing fees for alternative branded large-screen technology.

For example, we constantly review our ticket pricing structure and believe we have been able to increase our box office revenue in our cinemas in the United Kingdom through changes to our pricing strategy, such as the introduction of ‘‘peak’’ and ‘‘off-peak’’ pricing and the introduction of our ‘‘Super Tuesday’’ offer. Our pricing strategy also entails increasing pricing flexibility by cinema location based on variables including time of day, day of the week and type of customer for each film, resulting in ticket price increases in certain circumstances and in increased use of discounts in others. We aim to maximize revenue by offering premium propositions, such as VIP seating, for customer segments that value these elements while selectively using discounts, such as ‘‘Kids AM’’ to drive admissions volume. These strategies have positively impacted our average ticket price. We also analyze film scheduling in order to deliver the ‘‘right’’ film, on the ‘‘right’’ screen at the ‘‘right’’ time in order to achieve optimal attendance. We systematically test our film scheduling changes, which have driven increases in our admissions and box office revenue while decreasing variable staff costs as compared to a control group of our cinemas. We have also improved our cost structure by applying certain management principles and practices across our business and our newly acquired companies when integrating them into the Group. For example, we have applied a disciplined approach to our cost components by employing competitive tendering processes for both capital expenditures and for supply costs. We also seek to manage our staff costs in order to match, to the extent possible, staffing levels with admissions levels. We also renegotiate our lease costs where possible and have achieved cost savings at certain sites in the United Kingdom, Germany and Poland. We have also invested in energy savings initiatives to reduce electricity and other utility costs across our cinemas in all territories as well as optimizing costs by leveraging our pan-European platform to establish strong relationships with key suppliers such as Sony Digital Cinema. For the 52 weeks ended November 28, 2013, our capital expenditures were £22.3 million (net of landlord contributions, including two months of Multikino). We expect capital expenditures in 2014 to be less than £30 million (net of landlord contributions, including the full year effect of Multikino) and in 2015 to be less than £38 million (net of landlord contributions, including The Space).

Since November 2005, we have developed 21 new cinemas with 200 screens in the United Kingdom. We believe we have been able to maximize operating results in terms of total admissions, average ticket price, concession spend per person and return on investment by strategically selecting the ‘‘right’’ place, building the ‘‘right’’ size and paying the ‘‘right’’ rent for our new builds. For example, our cinemas range from larger cinemas such as Vue Stratford City in London, which is a 17-screen, 63,500 square-foot, state-of-the-art multiplex as part of an approximately £1.5 billion commercial development project for the 2012 London Olympics, to smaller cinemas such as Vue Halifax, which is a 9-screen, 27,100 square-foot cinema located within an approximately £55 million mixed use development project in Halifax town center. As a result of this rigorous approach to capital expenditure, during the period from 2006 through 2013, we have progressively reduced the average number of years to pay back our initial investment in new cinema developments. In Italy, we believe our acquisition of The Space will bolster our growth track record, as The Space’s admissions market share grew by 5.3% between 2010 and 2013, according to Dodona Research.

Cinema operators are an integral component of revenue generation for film distributors. According to the British Film Institute 2013 Statistical Yearbook, approximately 27% of a film’s total revenue in the United Kingdom is earned in cinemas. According to the National Association of Theatre Owners, the amount of time a film is exclusively licensed for cinematic display prior to licensing for other distribution channels has generally stabilized over the last five years leading to a more stable and predictable revenue stream. Furthermore, a successful cinema release supports a film’s revenue generation in channels after its initial theatrical release, such as DVD, Blu-ray, pay-per-view and cable. We believe attending the cinema remains one of the most popular and affordable out-of-home entertainment options for consumers. The market has been relatively resilient even during economic downturns. For example, based on GDP data from the IMF and GBOR data from the Cinema Exhibitors’ Association and the Germany Federal Film Board, as real GDP decreased in the United Kingdom and Germany, respectively, between 2007 and 2009, GBOR increased over the same period in both these markets. We believe our conveniently located, state-of-the art cinemas, as well as our strong market positions in the United Kingdom, Germany and Poland, have enabled us to maintain stable and consistent cash flows in those markets. In addition, we offer premium propositions to customers, such as VIP seating, 3D and our premium large format screens, Vue Xtreme, to generate revenue, while selectively using discounts to drive admissions volume. As a result, our average admissions levels and average ticket prices have remained relatively stable, including during the most recent economic downturn. In Italy, upon completion of The Space Acquisition, we plan to introduce VIP seating and certain concession offerings, including pick-and-mix confectionary, in addition to pricing initiatives, CRM improvements and utility efficiencies.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

We believe this has been a key strength in the past and we plan to continue to extend these best-practices to our acquired cinemas in Germany, Denmark, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania and, upon completion of The Space Acquisition, Italy. We will continue to focus on our operational strengths where historically we have been successful. For example, in 2012, in order to improve film scheduling, we analyzed and identified key drivers and conducted controlled scheduling trials at 24 cinemas in the United Kingdom for nine weeks. As a result, we were able to implement strategic changes that increased admissions and revenue at these cinemas while decreasing variable staff costs. We then rolled out these film scheduling strategies throughout our United Kingdom cinemas, and in 2014, we have been conducting further film scheduling improvement trials in both the United Kingdom and Germany to help us deliver the ‘‘right’’ film, on the ‘‘right’’ screen, at the ‘‘right’’ time, which we believe will help us to increase profitability. We believe this analytical testing approach to film scheduling should allow us to continue to increase profit across all of our operations. In Poland, we are implementing strategic trials to test the success of VIP seating and the Xtreme premium large-screen format. We have also reviewed the capital expenditure involved in planned new site developments in Poland, which have resulted in improvements in the projected returns on these new sites. We are also implementing new approaches to film scheduling in Poland, which we believe will increase revenues as we will be able to Schedule films during optimal time slots. In Italy, upon completion of The Space Acquisition, we plan to implement a number of operational improvements, including adding VIP seating and occupancy controls for air conditioning units in certain sites. We also intend to continue to apply a disciplined approach to all of our cost components. We have controlled our costs through a combination of competitive tendering processes, for both capital expenditures and for supply costs, which we intend to apply across our entire cinema portfolio. For example, we have recently begun to renegotiate leases to reduce property occupancy costs which will help us secure tenancy at key sites that are expected to deliver good long-term revenue generation. We also plan to continue our flexible staffing strategy to adjust employee-related costs in response to variations in admissions levels and to continue to invest in energy savings initiatives to reduce electricity and other utility costs across our cinemas. We also plan to renegotiate lease terms to reduce rental costs where possible. We believe we can continue to apply these costs strategies across our historical cinema portfolio and implement these practices across our acquired cinemas. We also intend to continue to incentivize certain managers and staff with bonuses based on profitability.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

We plan to pursue growth opportunities from our existing cinemas by attracting new customers and maximizing revenue from existing customers, opening new cinemas in the near term. We will also continue to evaluate and pursue selective acquisitions, such as The Space Acquisition. We seek to provide a wide range of customer propositions from value offers to premium offers in order to both attract new customers and maximize revenue from existing customers. We plan to continue to deliver an innovative cinema experience, with packaged, branded and tailored offerings supported by high quality standards that drive and protect revenue streams. For example, in the United Kingdom, we have ‘‘Kids AM’’ for children as well as ‘‘Over 18s Screenings’’ for adults. We also intend to continue screening film and alternative content to improve utilization generally in periods of low film demand and to provide unique content offerings for customers, such as opera, concerts, ballet and sporting events, such as the 2014 FIFA World Cup, at premium pricing levels. We are also working on implementing CRM initiatives across our markets through which we will target promotions and marketing to customers based on their past cinemagoing and purchasing activities to ensure a tailored cinema experience for our customers. We believe a key component in customer choice is having easily accessible cinema locations with good public transport links and plentiful car parking. In our new sites, we seek to develop cinemas in locations with complementary services, such as in retail malls with restaurants and other leisure activities. We actively monitor new cinema developments and maintain a shortlist of potential locations. We are also investigating the feasibility across all markets of developing smaller multiplexes in areas with catchments of less than 91 ----- 100,000 people. In the 52 weeks ended November 29, 2013, we opened five new sites, totalling 36 screens. In the 52 weeks ended August 28, 2014, we opened four new sites totaling 31 screens. We intend to continue to apply rigorous analytics of local catchment population, propensity to visit the cinema, income levels and local competition to ensure each cinema’s configuration closely matches market capacity of the catchment area. We also believe that our experiences managing landmark cinemas, such as Westfield London, Westfield Stratford City and Leicester Square, and our experience in lease negotiation and capital expenditure control should enable us to minimize development costs to achieve superior payback periods on new cinemas. We will continue to seek value-enhancing growth based on disciplined and sustainable strategies, including the careful evaluation, selection and pursuit of strategic opportunities throughout Europe. As with our acquisitions in the United Kingdom, Germany, Poland and Italy, we may seek to acquire cinema operators in Europe or elsewhere where we believe we can realize attractive returns on investment and generate significant free cash flow. We believe that certain markets in Europe remain fragmented and with our proven track record of identifying and integrating acquisitions successfully, we are well-placed to take advantage of strategic opportunities.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

We seek to continue to differentiate our cinema experience by expanding and improving our customer propositions. In addition to location and price, we believe that customers also choose cinemas based on the quality of the cinema experience. We are focused on creating a consistent brand image, synonymous with a state-of-the-art cinematic experience. We are also focusing on customer satisfaction in terms of ease of booking tickets, premium viewing options and offering a wide range of concessions. As the film industry produces franchise blockbusters that take advantage of premium formats such as 3D, we believe we can gain customers with our modern, state-of-the-art stadium-seated cinemas with digital technology such as Sony Digital Cinema 4K, which differentiates our cinema offering from less modern cinemas. We plan to continue to provide 3D formats and Vue Xtreme, which has premium large format screens and enhanced sound systems and have completed our digital investment with Sony Digital Cinema to provide 4K technology to our customers in Germany and Denmark. We are also currently considering the opportunity to introduce IMAX screens into certain of our cinemas in the United Kingdom, Germany and Denmark during 2015. We also plan to continue our emphasis on customer choice in terms of pricing, film selection and amenities. For example, we intend to continue offering across our cinema portfolio premium pricing options such as VIP seating where customers can enjoy larger, more luxurious seating in prime locations in the auditorium, as well as customer discount propositions such as ‘‘Kids AM’’ and ‘‘Super Tuesday’’ offers in the United Kingdom. In addition, we intend to continue to offer customer propositions like internet booking and mobile applications that allow customers greater flexibility and ease in purchasing their tickets across our cinemas. We plan to continue to emphasize customer satisfaction and focus on training and motivating our employees to provide an exceptional cinema experience. For example, we have cinema incentive plans that reward employees based on cinema profitability and customer service standards. We also provide our cinema employees with a modular training program that covers all aspects of running a cinema, including cinema management, in order to provide better customer service. Additionally, in order to gain critical customer insight, we employ a number of internal and external sources that provide detailed pictures of customer behavior, trends and attitudes. Listening to customers and understanding their behavior is core to our ability to deliver successful new offers, enhance existing offers and to better predict demand in the future. We actively track customer service metrics to check we are delivering high quality service to our customers with our friendly and helpful staff. We intend to extend these customer-focused training and tracking initiatives to our newly acquired cinemas.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

Tim’s business partner, deputy CEO, Alan McNair joined him in 1999. Both had extensive prior senior management experience in the cinema industry in the United Kingdom and internationally. The company was set up as Spean Bridge International Cinemas (SBC) with the support of Boston Ventures, a venture capital fund, and by the end of 2002, had opened four cinemas in the United Kingdom, and one in each of Portugal and Taiwan. 92 ----- In 2003, SBC acquired Warner Village Cinema’s UK circuit, which comprised 36 cinemas with 353 screens. Funds for the acquisition were provided by the existing investors and new investors. Following this acquisition, SBC changed its name to Vue Entertainment and became the operator of the second largest cinema chain by number of screens in the United Kingdom. The combined 400-screen state-of-the-art stadium seating multiplex cinema portfolio including the flagship Leicester Square cinema was fully rebranded as ‘‘Vue’’ within six months. The Vue portfolio continued to grow both organically and through a series of acquisitions including the acquisition of Ster Century in 2005, which at the time operated the highest grossing cinema in the United Kingdom and Ireland at the Liffey Valley Shopping Centre in Dublin. In 2006, we completed a management buyout backed by Bank of Scotland Integrated Finance and simultaneously acquired the five cinemas we had been managing under contract for Village Roadshow. Between 2006 and the end of 2010, we developed an additional 14 cinemas in the United Kingdom, adding 133 screens to the portfolio and acquired Hoyts’ 6-screen Wood Green cinema, bringing our portfolio to 70 cinemas and 679 screens. Between 2010 through 2012, we achieved several significant milestones including opening two marketleading cinemas in London, our 14-screen cinema at Vue Westfield London in 2010 and our 17-screen cinema at Vue Westfield Stratford City in 2011, which, according to IBOE/Rentrak, were the number one and four cinemas, respectively, in the United Kingdom for the 52 weeks ended August 28, 2014, as measured by GBOR. We were acquired by Doughty Hanson at the end of 2010. In 2012, we completed the acquisition of Apollo in the United Kingdom and CinemaxX in Germany and Denmark. Apollo added nine cinemas and 56 screens in the United Kingdom (after disposal of five cinemas with 27 screens), further strengthening our position in the United Kingdom. CinemaxX represented our first significant international acquisition, adding 34 cinemas located in Germany and Denmark to our portfolio. More recently, we acquired Multikino in Poland in September 2013, giving us a market-leading presence across both Western and Eastern Europe. In the same year, OMERS and AIMCo acquired Vue through the Vue Acquisition. In 2014, we closed our loss-making site in Portugal in July 2014 and most recently entered into an agreement to acquire The Space in October 2014.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

The top three cinema operators in the United Kingdom are Cineworld, Odeon and Vue. The market also has smaller multiplex operators and independent cinema operators, which generally operate non-multiplex cinemas. According to IBOE/Rentrak, our GBOR market share in the United Kingdom was approximately 23.4% for the 52 weeks ended November 28, 2013 and 22.8% for the 39 weeks ended August 28, 2014. According to Dodona Research, the United Kingdom has high multiplex penetration with approximately 75% of all screens being in multiplex cinemas as of the end of 2013.

We also operate cinemas in Denmark, Ireland, Taiwan, Latvia, Lithuania and, after completion of The Space Acquisition, Italy. Cinema remains an integral channel for distribution of films in terms of revenue for film production companies. Cinema is also vital in establishing a film’s value when marketed through other channels, such as network, rental, cable and satellite television, in-home television, DVDs, video-on-demand, pay-per-view services or streaming and downloads via the Internet. Cinema has exhibited relatively limited long-term admissions volatility and has demonstrated GBOR growth over the last decade despite competing technologies and economic downturns. Additionally, GBOR has also typically been resilient to macroeconomic fluctuations. For example, based on GDP data from the IMF and GBOR data from the Cinema Exhibitors’ Association and the Germany Federal Film Board, as real GDP decreased in the United Kingdom and Germany, respectively, between 2007 and 2009, GBOR increased over the same period in both these markets. Cinemas are subject to varying degrees of competition in the geographic areas in which they operate. Competition on the individual cinema level focuses on attracting and retaining customers, and competition on the cinema operator level focuses on achieving favorable film licensing terms, pricing strategies and finding new cinemas sites. The cinema industry also faces competition for customers’ leisure time and disposable income from other forms of out-of-home entertainment, including sporting events, music concerts, theater, restaurants and family leisure attractions such as theme parks. Cinemas also compete, to a lesser degree, with other in-home distribution channels for filmed entertainment, such as both broadcast and cable television, film rentals, pay-per-view and home video systems. In Europe, the cinema and film industry are nearing the end of the process of converting from celluloid film-based media to digital media. Digital media provides a superior visual experience for customers, and allows for greater flexibility in content programming as it allows operators to present additional formats, such as digital 3D, and pre-recorded materials for corporate bookings and alternative content including sporting and cultural events. Digital media also allows for greater flexibility in scheduling as changing from one film to another, or from one content to another, is easier than with celluloid film. 93 -----",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

Other than our acquisition of CinemaxX in 2012, the last significant market development in Germany was UCI Kinowelt’s acquisition of KPE Multiplextheater in 2008. The top three cinema operators in Germany, according to Dodona Research, are Cinestar, CinemaxX and UCI, with a combined holding of less than a quarter of screens for the year ended December 31, 2013. Despite significant waves of investment in the 1990s and the early 2000s with new market entrants, according to Dodona Research, multiplex penetration remains low at approximately 28% of all screens in Germany, with cinema-goers preferring more traditional high street locations that generally only have one screen. However, despite the relatively low multiplex penetration and accessibility, according to Dodona Research, multiplexes represent approximately 48% of admissions in Germany, which we believe demonstrates their attractiveness to customers and, as a result, provides an opportunity for new cinema development. The total number of screens in Germany has been decreasing as a result of the phase-out of traditional cinemas. Cinema operators in Germany continue to convert to digital technology, with now over 90% of screens utilizing digital technology. According to Dodona Research, this is expected to reach 100% by the end of 2014. The majority of cinema admissions in Germany are to international films; however local Germanlanguage films also drive admissions.

The total number of screens in Italy has been increasing steadily since 2000 as a result of the roll-out of multiplex sites, which has been partly offset by the replacement and closure of small independent operators.

Multikino in Poland and The Space in Italy became fully digitalized in September 2011 and October 2012, respectively. Digital technology provides improved presentation quality to customers and lower costs to the film distributor as a result of not having to manufacture and deliver actual physical film prints to cinema operators. To help cinema operators finance the cost of conversion to digital projection, film distributors pay fees, 97 ----- generally referred to as ‘‘virtual print fees,’’ to operators (or third party intermediaries) based on films presented on approved digital projection platforms. Film distributors pay virtual print fees until a cost recoupment date or threshold has been reached. Multikino and The Space continue to receive the benefit of virtual print fees paid directly by film distributors while in the other regions where we operate, namely the United Kingdom and Germany, virtual print fees are received by intermediaries. In particular, we contracted with Sony Digital Cinema to convert our 35mm projection equipment in the United Kingdom and Germany to digital projection equipment. As part of the shared financing of the conversion, Sony Digital Cinema will receive virtual print fees from film distributors for the projectors for the next ten years or until they recoup their investment in the digital conversion. We were an early adopter of 4K technology across our cinemas in the United Kingdom and Ireland through a strategic partnership with Sony Digital Cinema. 4K technology has a four-times higher pixel count than the alternative, lower quality, 2K digital technology, which provides a lower quality picture. We believe our digital proposition in the United Kingdom is technologically superior to our competitors’ 2K digital capabilities and provides us with a competitive advantage, particularly as an increasing number of movies are filmed in 4K. Furthermore, our strategic partnership with Sony Digital Cinema allowed us to secure favorable terms with attractive pricing. We extended our relationship with Sony Digital Cinema for the rollout of 4K projectors and other digital technology in our cinemas in Germany and Denmark, after the acquisition of CinemaxX in 2012, and this rollout was completed in July 2013. The roll-out of 4K projectors in Germany and Denmark was supported by the industry-wide virtual print fee arrangements with major US film distributors. The projectors are leased and subsequently paid for through virtual print fees charged to play each individual film. These arrangements are expected to last for a maximum of ten years from installation, by which time the projectors will be paid-off and wholly-owned by us.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

We believe that 3D film quality continues to improve as films are increasingly produced specifically for 3D. We expect the number of 3D-format films to be released in 2015 to be broadly consistent with 2013 and 2014. We believe 3D-equipped screens provide us with flexibility in film scheduling and provides our customers with increased choice. Typically, in the United Kingdom, we schedule 3D films to enable customers to choose from different film formats, such as between 2D and 3D, as well as among other films. Our investment in 3D in the United Kingdom has focused on return on investment and incremental revenue increase from 3D screen capability instead of focusing on a full 3D roll-out across all of our screens. As a result, we believe we have been able to achieve a higher 3D GBOR per 3D screen than our primary competitors. As of August 28, 2014, 33.2% of our screens in the United Kingdom were equipped with 3D technology, which accounted for 16.6% of total box office revenues for the 52 weeks ended August 28, 2014. In Germany 65% of our screens are equipped with 3D technology and in Poland 75% of Multikino’s screens are equipped with 3D technology, as of August 28, 2014. The variation in 3D screen penetration across our cinemas is a function of legacy investment decisions while CinemaxX and Multikino were under previous ownership. In Italy, 40% of The Space screens are equipped with 3D technology. We have recently chosen to replace our current RealD 3D equipment with competitive equipment offerings from Masterimage and Sony 3D, and we expect the equipment conversion to take place between 2014 and 2018, as our licenses with RealD expire. RealD currently have patents pending in Europe on their technology and the granting of these patents may result in patent infringement claims against Masterimage by RealD. Vue is currently negotiating an appropriate indemnity with Masterimage in respect of this potential claim by RealD against Masterimage. We believe that any disruptions resulting from this potential claim would be minimal, as we would only use this technology for a small fraction of our screens.

The share valuation had been determined by Vue Beteiligungs GmbH based on a valuation by an independent party. The valuation had been reviewed and confirmed as fair by a court-appointed auditor before the CinemaxX annual general meeting in August 2013. Following the settlement of a voidance law suit with respect to the Squeeze Out filed by a minority shareholder, the minority shareholders were ultimately paid an amount per share that was higher than the initial valuation.

The determination of the Applicable Rate and the Interest Amount by the Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of willful default, bad faith or manifest error, be binding on all parties. The Calculation Agent will, upon the written request of the Holder of any Floating Rate Note, provide the interest rate then in effect with respect to the Floating Rate Notes. The rights of holders of beneficial interests in the Floating Rate Notes to receive the payments of interest on the Notes will be subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 365-day year and the actual number of days elapsed. Interest on overdue principal and interest and Additional Amounts and premium, if any, will accrue at a rate that is 1% higher than the then Applicable Rate on the Floating Rate Notes. The Applicable Rate on the Floating Rate Notes will in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law. Set forth below is a summary of certain of the defined terms used in the Indenture relating to the calculation of interest on the Floating Rate Notes: ‘‘Determination Date,’’ with respect to an Interest Period, will be the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days preceding the first day of such Interest Period. ‘‘EURIBOR,’’ with respect to an Interest Period, will be the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for deposits in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date that appears on Reuters Screen EURIBOR 01 Page as of 11:00 a.m. Brussels time, on the Determination Date. If Reuters Screen EURIBOR 01 Page does not include such a rate or is unavailable on a Determination Date, the Calculation Agent will request the principal London office of each of four major 132 ----- banks in the Euro-zone interbank market, as selected by the Calculation Agent to provide such bank’s offered quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such Determination Date, to prime banks in the Euro-zone interbank market for deposits in a Representative Amount in euro for a three- month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such offered quotations are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the Calculation Agent will request each of three major banks in London, as selected by the Calculation Agent, to provide such bank’s rate (expressed as a percentage per annum), as of approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such Determination Date, for loans in a Representative Amount in euro to leading European banks for a three- month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such rates are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If fewer than two such rates are so provided, then the rate for the Interest Period will be the rate in effect with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period. ‘‘Euro-zone’’ means the region composed of member states of the European Union that at the relevant time have adopted the euro. ‘‘Interest Period’’ means the period commencing on and including an interest payment date and ending on and including the day immediately preceding the next succeeding interest payment date. ‘‘Representative Amount’’ means the greater of (a) c1.0 million and (b) an amount that is representative for a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time. ‘‘Reuters Screen EURIBOR 01 Page’’ means the display page so designated on Reuters (or such other page as may replace that page on that service, or such other service as may be nominated as the information vendor). ‘‘TARGET Settlement Day’’ means any day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET) System is open.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

See ‘‘Risk Factors — The Proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the Notes.’’ No appraisals of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Company or the Guarantors in connection with this Offering of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral, in whole or in part, pursuant to the Indenture and the Security Documents following an 139 ----- Acceleration Event (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), would be sufficient to satisfy amounts due on the Notes or the Guarantees. By its nature, some or all the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral would be sold in a timely manner or at all. See ‘‘Risk Factors — It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral.’’ The Security Documents will be governed by the law of the jurisdiction to which the relevant Collateral is subject and provide that the rights with respect to the Notes and the Indenture must be exercised by the Security Agent and in respect of the entire outstanding amount of the Notes. The term ‘‘Security Interests’’ refers to the Liens in the Collateral. Under the Indenture, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries are permitted to incur certain additional Indebtedness in the future that may share in the Collateral, including Indebtedness with priority rights to proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral. The amount of such additional Indebtedness will be limited by the covenants described under the captions ‘‘— Certain Covenants — Liens’’ and ‘‘— Certain Covenants — Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock.’’ Under certain circumstances, the amount of such additional Indebtedness that may share in the Collateral could be significant. Each of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall, and shall procure that each of its respective Subsidiaries, if any, shall, at its own expense, execute and do all such acts and things and provide such assurances as the Security Agent may reasonably require (1) for registering any Security Document relating to the Collateral in any required register and for perfecting or protecting the security intended to be afforded by such Security Document relating to the Collateral; and (2) if such Security Document is enforced in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement, for facilitating the realization of all or any part of the assets which are subject to such Security Document and for facilitating the exercise of all powers, authorities and discretions vested in the Security Agent or in any receiver of all or any part of the Collateral. Each of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall, and shall procure that each of its respective Subsidiaries, if any, shall, execute such transfers, conveyances, assignments and releases of that property whether to the Security Agent or to its nominees and give such notices, orders and directions which the Security Agent may reasonably request.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

The Company will not give any such notice of redemption earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Company or the Guarantor, as applicable, would be obligated to make such payment or withholding if a payment in respect of the Notes were then due, and the obligation to pay Additional Amounts must be in effect (or be scheduled to come into effect on or prior to the next date on which any amount would be payable under or in respect of the Notes or any Guarantee) at the time such notice is given. Prior to the publication or, where relevant, mailing of any notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an opinion of independent tax counsel (the choice of such counsel to be subject to the prior written approval of the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld)) to the effect that there has been such Change in Tax Law which would entitle the Company to redeem the Notes hereunder.

In the Change of Control Offer, the Company will offer a payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes repurchased to the date of purchase (the ‘‘Change of Control Payment’’), subject to the rights of holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date. Unless the Company has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes of a series as described under ‘‘— Optional Redemption’’ or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Company will mail a notice to each holder of the Notes at such holder’s registered address or otherwise deliver a notice in accordance with the procedures described under ‘‘— Selection and Notice,’’ stating that a Change of Control Offer is being made and offering to repurchase Notes on the date (the ‘‘Change of Control Payment Date’’) specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed or delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice. The Change of Control Offer shall be open for a period of no less than 20 days, and the Company will comply with the requirements of any applicable securities laws and regulations to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with any applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such compliance. On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered; and (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes properly accepted together with an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of Notes being purchased by the Company. The Paying Agent will promptly mail (or cause to be delivered) to each holder of the Notes properly tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee (or its authenticating agent) will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any. The Company will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date. The provisions described above that require the Company to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable. 143 ----- Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the holders of the Notes to require that the Company repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer, or (2) a notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described above under the caption ‘‘— Optional Redemption,’’ unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will provide that the occurrence of a change of control would in each case require the repayment of all the outstanding Indebtedness thereunder. If the Company experiences a change of control that triggers a mandatory prepayment under its Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Company may seek the agreement of the relevant lenders thereunder to maintain the availability of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or seek to refinance the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. Future debt of the Company or its Subsidiaries may prohibit the Company from purchasing the Notes in the event of a Change of Control or provide that a Change of Control is a default or require a repurchase upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the holders of the Notes of their right to require the Company to purchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, other debt, even if a Change of Control does not, due to the financial effect of the purchase on the Company. Finally, the Company’s ability to repurchase Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by the Company’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make the required purchase of the Notes. See ‘‘Risk Factors — Risks Relating to the Notes and the Guarantees — We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance a change of control offer.’’ The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the properties or assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase ‘‘substantially all,’’ there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of the Notes to require the Company to repurchase its Notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes prior to the occurrence of the Change of Control. If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Global Exchange Market and the rules of the Irish Stock Exchange so require, the Company will publish a public announcement with respect to the results of any Change of Control Offer in a leading newspaper of general circulation in Ireland (which is expected to be the Irish Times) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notice on the official website of the Irish Stock Exchange (www.ise.ie).",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

No Fixed Rate Notes of £100,000 or less can be redeemed in part and no Floating Rate Notes of c100,000 or less can be redeemed in part. Notices of redemption will be mailed by first class mail at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of Notes to be redeemed at its registered address, except that redemption notices may be mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture. If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note will state the portion of the principal amount of that Note that is to be redeemed. A new Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Note will be issued in the name of the holder of the Notes upon cancellation of the original Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of Notes called for redemption. For Notes which are represented by global certificates held on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, notices may be given by delivery of the relevant notices to Euroclear or Clearstream for communication to entitled account holders in substitution for the aforesaid mailing. So long as any Notes are listed on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Global Exchange Market and the rules of the Irish Stock Exchange so require, any such notice to the holders of the relevant Notes shall also be published in a newspaper having a general circulation in Ireland (which is expected to be the Irish Times) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, posted on the official website of the Irish Stock Exchange (www.ise.ie) and, in connection with any redemption, the Company will notify the Irish Stock Exchange of any change in the principal amount of Notes outstanding.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

For purposes of determining compliance with any sterling-denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness, the Sterling-Equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a different currency shall be utilized, calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed, in the case of Indebtedness incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided, however, that (i) if such Indebtedness denominated in non-sterling currency is subject to a Currency Exchange Protection Agreement, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in sterling will be calculated so as to take account of the effects of such Currency Exchange Protection Agreement; and (ii) the Sterling-Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date. The principal amount of any refinancing Indebtedness incurred in the same 150 ----- currency as the Indebtedness being refinanced will be the Sterling-Equivalent of the Indebtedness refinanced determined on the date such Indebtedness was originally incurred, except that to the extent that: (1) such Sterling-Equivalent was determined based on a Currency Exchange Protection Agreement, in which case the refinancing Indebtedness will be determined in accordance with the preceding sentence; and (2) the principal amount of the refinancing Indebtedness exceeds the principal amount of the Indebtedness being refinanced, in which case the Sterling-Equivalent of such excess will be determined on the date such refinancing Indebtedness is being incurred. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in exchange rates or currency values. The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be: (1) in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount, the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined in accordance with UK GAAP; (2) the principal amount of the Indebtedness, in the case of any other Indebtedness; and (3) in respect of Indebtedness of another Person secured by a Lien on the assets of the specified Person, the lesser of: (i) the Fair Market Value of such assets at the date of determination; and (ii) the amount of the Indebtedness of the other Person.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

The following is not exhaustive and does not deal with any other United Kingdom taxation implications of acquiring, holding or disposing of Notes. The United Kingdom tax treatment of prospective noteholders depends on their individual circumstances and may be subject to change in the future. Prospective noteholders who may be subject to tax in a jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom or who may be unsure as to their tax position should seek their own professional advice.",62.1.1,Payment of interest on the Notes,"Payments of interest on the Notes may be made without deduction of or withholding on account of United Kingdom income tax provided that the Notes continue to be listed on a ‘‘recognized stock exchange’’ within the meaning of section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (the ‘‘Act’’). The Irish Stock Exchange is a recognized stock exchange. The Notes will satisfy this requirement if they are officially listed in Ireland in accordance with provisions corresponding to those generally applicable in EEA states and are admitted to trading on the Global Exchange Market of the Irish Stock Exchange. Provided, therefore, that the Notes remain so listed, interest on the Notes will be payable without withholding or deduction on account of United Kingdom tax. Interest on the Notes may also be paid without withholding or deduction on account of United Kingdom tax where interest on the Notes is paid by a company and, at the time the payment is made, the Issuer reasonably believes (and any person by or through whom interest on the Notes is paid reasonably believes) that the beneficial owner is within the charge to United Kingdom corporation tax as regards the payment of interest, provided that HM Revenue and Customs (‘‘HMRC’’) has not given a direction (in circumstances where it has reasonable grounds to believe that it is likely that the above exemption is not available in respect of such payment of interest at the time the payment is made) that the interest should be paid under deduction of tax. In other cases, an amount must generally be withheld from payments of interest on the Notes that has a United Kingdom source on account of United Kingdom income tax at the basic rate (currently 20%). However, where an applicable double tax treaty provides for a lower rate of withholding tax (or for no tax to be withheld) in relation to a noteholder, HMRC can issue a notice to the Issuer to pay interest to the noteholder without deduction of tax (or for interest to be paid with tax deducted at the rate provided for in the relevant double tax treaty). If a Guarantor makes any payment in respect of interest on the Notes (or in respect of other amounts due under the Notes other than the repayment of amounts subscribed for the Notes) such payments may be subject to withholding on account of United Kingdom tax, subject to such relief as may be available under the provisions of any applicable double tax treaty or any other relief that may apply. Such payments by a Guarantor may not, however, be eligible for the exemptions from the obligation to withhold tax described in the paragraphs above. Any premium payable on redemption may be treated as a payment of interest for United Kingdom tax purposes and may accordingly be subject to the withholding tax treatment described above. Interest on the Notes that constitutes United Kingdom source income for tax purposes may be subject to United Kingdom tax by direct assessment even where paid without withholding, subject to exceptions 201 ----- applying to various categories of investors (including, in particular, exceptions applying to persons not resident in the United Kingdom). HMRC has powers, in certain circumstances, to obtain information about: payments derived from securities (whether income or capital); certain payments of interest (including the amount payable on the redemption of a deeply discounted security); and securities transactions. The persons from whom HMRC can obtain information include: a person who receives (or is entitled to receive) a payment derived from securities; a person who makes such a payment (received from, or paid on behalf of another person); a person by or through whom interest is paid or credited; a person who effects or is a party to securities transactions (which includes an issue of securities) on behalf of others; registrars or administrators in respect of securities transactions; and each registered or inscribed holder of securities. The information HMRC can obtain includes: details of the beneficial owner of securities; details of the person for whom the securities are held, or the person to whom the payment is to be made (and, if more than one, their respective interests); information and documents relating to securities transactions; and, in relation to interest paid or credited on money received or retained in the United Kingdom, the identity of the security under which interest is paid. HMRC is generally not able to obtain information (under its power relating solely to interest) about a payment of interest to (or a receipt for) a person that is not an individual. This limitation does not apply to HMRC’s power to obtain information about payments derived from securities. HMRC has indicated that it will not use its information-gathering power on interest to obtain information about amounts payable on the redemption of deeply discounted securities which are paid before April 6, 2015.

On March 24, 2014, the Council of the European Union adopted a Council Directive amending and broadening the scope of the requirements described above. Member States are required to apply these new requirements from January 1, 2017. The change will expand the range of payments covered by the Directive, in particular to include additional types of income payable on securities. The Directive will also expand the circumstances in which payments that indirectly benefit an individual resident in a Member State must be reported. This approach will apply to payments made to, or secured for, persons, entities or legal arrangements (including trusts) where certain conditions are satisfied, and may in some cases apply where the person, entity or arrangement is established or effectively managed outside of the European Union. For a transitional period, Luxembourg and Austria are required (unless during that period they elect otherwise) to operate a withholding system in relation to such payments. During that transitional period, withholding will not apply under the Directive to a payment if the beneficial owners of the payment authorizes exchange of information instead. The changes referred to above will broaden the types of payments subject to withholding in those Member States which still operate a withholding system when they are implemented. In April 2013, the Luxembourg Government announced its intention to abolish the withholding system with effect from 1 January 2015, in favor of automatic information exchange under the Directive.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475
887,Offerings 2014.md,62,CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS,62.3,United States Taxation,62.3.1,U.S. Holders,"_Payments of Interest_ Except as described below with respect to original issue discount, payments of stated interest on an Additional Note (without reduction for any amounts withheld and including payments of any Additional Amounts) will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary income at the time such payment is received or accrued, in accordance with the holder’s method of accounting for tax purposes. The amount of income recognized by a cash basis U.S. Holder will be the U.S. dollar value of the interest payment, based on the exchange rate in effect on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. An accrual basis U.S. Holder may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to an interest payment denominated in, or determined by reference to, a foreign currency in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, the amount of income accrued will be based on the average exchange rate in effect during the interest accrual period (or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. Holder, the part of the period within the taxable year). Under the second method, the U.S. Holder may elect to determine the amount of income accrued on the basis of the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the accrual period or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years, the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the part of the period within the taxable year. Additionally, if a payment of interest is received within five business days of the last day of the accrual period, an electing accrual basis U.S. Holder may instead translate the accrued interest into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the day of receipt. Any such election will apply to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by the U.S. Holder, and will be irrevocable without the consent of the IRS. Upon receipt of an interest payment (including a payment attributable to accrued but unpaid interest upon the sale or other disposition of an Additional Note) denominated in a foreign currency, an accrual basis 203 ----- U.S. Holder will recognize exchange gain or loss (generally taxable as U.S. source ordinary income or loss) equal to the difference, if any, between the amount received (translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date of receipt) and the amount previously accrued (as determined above), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. Stated interest paid by the Issuer on the Additional Notes (without reduction for any amounts withheld), original issue discount (as discussed below) accrued with respect to the Additional Notes, if any, and payments of any Additional Amounts will generally constitute passive category income from sources outside the United States under the rules regarding the U.S. foreign tax credit allowable to a U.S. Holder (and the limitations imposed thereon). The rules governing U.S. foreign tax credits are complex, and U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the availability of U.S. foreign tax credits in their particular circumstances. _Original Issue Discount_ Because the issue price of the Additional Notes is less than its principal amount by more than a de minimis amount, U.S. Holders will be subject to special U.S. federal income tax rules with respect to this original issue discount (‘‘OID’’). OID is considered to be de minimis if it is less than 0.25% of the principal amount multiplied by the number of complete years to maturity. The ‘‘issue price’’ of the Additional Notes will be the first price at which a substantial amount of such Additional Notes are first sold to persons other than bondhouses, brokers, or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents, or wholesalers. The ‘‘stated redemption price at maturity’’ of an Additional Note is the total of all payments provided by the Additional Note that are not payments of ‘‘qualified stated interest.’’ Stated interest on the Additional Notes will constitute qualified stated interest. U.S. Holders of Additional Notes will be required to include OID in income calculated on a constant-yield method before the receipt of cash attributable to the income, and will generally have to include in income increasingly greater amounts of OID over the life of the Additional Notes. The amount of OID that will be included in income by a U.S. Holder is the sum of the daily portions of OID with respect to the Additional Note for each day during the taxable year or portion of the taxable year in which the U.S. Holder holds the Additional Note. The daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any ‘‘accrual period’’ a pro rata portion of the OID allocable to that accrual period. Accrual periods with respect to an Additional Note may be of any length selected by the U.S. Holder and may vary in length over the term of the Additional Note as long as (i) no accrual period is longer than one year and (ii) each scheduled payment of interest or principal on the Additional Note occurs on either the final or first day of an accrual period. The amount of OID allocable to an accrual period equals the excess of (a) the product of the Additional Note’s adjusted issue price at the beginning of the accrual period and the Additional Note’s yield to maturity (determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of the accrual period) over (b) the sum of the payments of qualified stated interest on the Additional Note allocable to the accrual period. The adjusted issue price of an Additional Note at the beginning of any accrual period is the issue price of the Additional Note increased by (x) the amount of accrued OID for each prior accrual period and decreased by (y) the amount of any payments previously made on the Additional Note that were not qualified stated interest payments. For purposes of determining OID accruals and adjusted issue price only, the amounts of stated interest and OID are determined by assuming that the interest rate on the Additional Notes is a fixed rate based on the value of the floating rate applicable to the Additional Notes as of the issue date. OID will be determined for any accrual period in foreign currency and then translated into U.S. dollars in the same manner as stated interest accrued by an accrual basis U.S. Holder. In such event, upon receipt of an amount attributable to OID (whether in connection with a payment of interest or the sale or disposition of such Additional Note), a U.S. Holder of such Additional Note would recognize foreign currency gain or loss in an amount determined in the same manner as interest income received by a U.S. Holder on the accrual basis, as described above. Foreign currency gain or loss generally would be treated as ordinary income or loss and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense. _Pre-Issuance Accrued Interest_ On the first interest payment date following the date of issue of the Additional Notes, Holders of the Additional Notes will be entitled to receive interest that has ‘‘accrued’’ as of October 15, 2014 (‘‘pre-issuance accrued interest’’). A U.S. Holder may elect to exclude pre-issuance accrued interest, if any, from the price of an Additional Note. In that event, a portion of the first interest payment will be treated as a non-taxable return of the pre-issuance accrued interest (except that a U.S. Holder generally would be required to 204 ----- recognize exchange gain or loss, as discussed above, in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the pre-issuance accrued interest at the time of purchase and at the time the payment of such pre-issuance accrued interest is received, as determined at the spot rate in effect on each such date) and will reduce the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the applicable Additional Note by a corresponding amount. If a U.S. Holder does not make this election, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of any pre-issuance accrued interest is not entirely clear. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisers concerning the U.S. federal income tax treatment of any pre-issuance accrued interest. _Sale or Other Disposition of Additional Notes_ Generally, upon the sale, exchange, redemption or other taxable disposition of an Additional Note, a U.S. Holder will recognize taxable gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale, exchange, redemption or other taxable disposition (less any amount attributable to accrued but unpaid interest not previously included in income, which will be taxable as such) and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Additional Note. The amount realized by a U.S. Holder shall not include pre-issuance accrued interest, if any, that is excluded from the purchase price of an Additional Note. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in an Additional Note will generally equal the cost of such Additional Note to such U.S. Holder (excluding any amount attributable to pre-issuance accrued interest, if any, that is excluded from the purchase price of an Additional Note), increased by the amount of OID previously included in the U.S. Holder’s income with respect to the Additional Note, reduced by the amount of any payments made with respect to the Additional Note that are not qualified stated interest payments. A U.S. Holder’s tax basis in an Additional Note will be determined by reference to the U.S. dollar cost of the Additional Note. The U.S. dollar cost of an Additional Note purchased with a foreign currency will generally be the U.S. dollar value of the purchase price on the date of purchase. Except to the extent attributable to accrued but unpaid interest or changes in exchange rates, gain or loss recognized on the sale or other disposition of an Additional Note will generally be capital gain or loss and will be long term capital gain or loss if at the time of sale or other disposition the Additional Note has been held by such U.S. Holder for more than one year, and will generally be treated as from U.S. sources for purposes of the U.S. foreign tax credit limitation. Therefore, a U.S. Holder may have insufficient foreign source income to utilize foreign tax credits attributable to foreign withholding taxes, if any, imposed on the sale or other disposition. Prospective purchasers should consult their tax advisers as to the foreign tax credit implications of the sale or retirement of Additional Notes. The amount realized on a sale or other disposition for an amount in foreign currency will be the U.S. dollar value of this amount on the date of sale or other disposition or, in the case of Additional Notes traded on an established securities market, as defined in the applicable U.S. Treasury regulations, if sold by a cash basis U.S. Holder (or an accrual basis U.S. Holder that so elects), on the settlement date for the sale. Such an election by an accrual basis U.S. Holder must be applied consistently from year to year and cannot be revoked without the consent of the IRS. In the case of a U.S. Holder that is an individual, estate or trust, the maximum marginal U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to long term capital gains is currently lower than the maximum marginal rate applicable to ordinary income. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to significant limitations. Gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on the sale or other disposition of an Additional Note that is attributable to changes in exchange rates will generally be treated as U.S. source ordinary income or loss. Gain or loss attributable to changes in exchange rates generally will equal the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s foreign currency purchase price for the Additional Note, determined at the spot rate on the date the U.S. Holder disposes of the Additional Note (or on the settlement date, if the Additional Notes are then traded on an established securities market and the holder is either a cash basis U.S. Holder or an electing accrual basis U.S. Holder) and the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s purchase price for the Additional Note, determined at the spot rate on the date the U.S. Holder purchased such Additional Note. In addition, upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of an Additional Note, a U.S. Holder may realize exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest, and accrued OID, which will be treated as discussed above under ‘‘— Payments of Interest.’’ However, exchange gain or loss (including with respect to accrued interest, and accrued OID) is taken into account only to the extent of total gain or loss realized on the transaction.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

887,Offerings 2014.md,62,CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS,62.4,German Taxation,62.4.1,Taxation of Current Income and Capital Gains,"_Tax Residents_ This subsection ‘‘Tax Residents’’ refers to persons who are tax residents of Germany (i.e., persons whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat, or place of effective management and control is located in Germany). Income derived from capital investments under the Notes as well as capital gains (which include currency gains and losses, if any) from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes held by an individual holder who is tax resident in Germany are in general subject to German income tax at a flat-tax rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge and, where applicable, church tax thereon) (Abgeltungsteuer) if the Notes are held as private investment (Privatverm¨ogen). Individual holders who are tax resident in Germany are entitled to a maximum annual allowance (Sparer-Pauschbetrag) of c801 (c1,602 for married couples filing jointly); actually incurred higher expenses directly attributable to a capital investment are not deductible. The personal income tax liability of an individual holder who is tax resident in Germany on income from capital investments under the Notes will, in principle, be settled by the tax withheld (as described under section ‘‘Withholding Tax’’ below). To the extent withholding tax has not been levied, such as in the case of Notes kept in custody abroad or, if no Disbursing Agent is involved in the payment process, the individual holder must include his or her income and capital gains derived from the Notes in his or her annual tax return and will then also be taxed at a rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge and, where applicable, church tax thereon). Further, an individual holder may apply for a taxation of all investment income of a given year at his or her lower individual tax rate based upon an assessment to tax with any amounts over-withheld being refunded. In each case, the deduction of expenses (other than transaction costs) on an itemized basis is not permitted. Losses incurred with respect to the Notes can only be offset with investment income of the individual holder realized in the same or following years. Pursuant to a tax decree issued by the German Federal Ministry of Finance dated October 9, 2012 losses from bad debts (Forderungsausfall) or a waiver of a receivable (Forderungsverzicht) to the extent the waiver does not qualify as a hidden capital contribution shall not be treated as a disposal. Accordingly, losses incurred from bad debts and waivers shall not be tax-deductible if the Notes are held as private investment (Privatverm¨ogen). The same rules should be applicable according to the said tax decree, if the Notes expire worthless so that losses may not be tax-deductible at all. Losses suffered in a sale of Notes will only be recognized according to the view of the tax authorities, if the proceeds received in the sale exceed the respective transaction costs. Where Notes form part of a trade or business of an individual or corporate holder or the income from the Notes qualifies as income from the letting and leasing of property, the withholding tax, if any, will not settle the personal or corporate income tax liability. Rather, the income is subject to individual or corporate income tax (plus solidarity surcharge and, where applicable, church tax). Where Notes form part of a trade or business, interest (paid or accrued) must be taken into account as income. The respective holder will have to include income and related (business) expenses in the annual tax return and the balance will be taxed at the holder’s applicable tax rate. Withholding tax levied, if any, will be credited as advance payment against the personal or corporate income tax liability of the holder or, to the extent exceeding this personal or corporate income tax liability, will be refunded. Where Notes form part of a German trade or business the current income and gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes may also be subject to German trade tax. The trade tax liability depends on the municipal trade tax factor (Gewerbesteuerhebesatz). If the holder is an individual or an individual partner of a partnership, the trade tax may generally be completely or partly credited against the personal income tax pursuant to a lump sum tax credit method. _Non-Tax Residents_ Interest, including accrued interest, and capital gains (which include currency gains and losses, if any) from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes received by holders who are not tax-resident in Germany (i.e., holders whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat and place of effective management and control is not located in Germany) are generally not subject to German taxation, unless (i) the Notes form part of the business property of a permanent establishment, including a permanent representative, or a fixed base maintained in Germany by the holder or (ii) the income otherwise constitutes German source income. Among other things, interest payments under the Notes would be considered German-source income if the Notes were secured by German real estate, unless the Notes (x) are registered in 207 ----- a public debt register (¨offentliches Schuldbuch), (y) a global note (Sammelurkunde) has been issued to evidence the Notes, or (z) qualify as fungible notes representing the same issue (Teilschuldverschreibungen) for German tax purposes. In cases (i) and (ii) above a tax regime similar to that explained above under subsection ‘‘— _Tax Residents’’ applies save that a deduction of expenses incurred by the non-resident Noteholder may be limited to c801 even if the Notes form part of a trade or business.

The tax rate is 25% (plus solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding being 26.375%). Individuals subject to church tax may apply in writing for church tax to be levied by way of withholding also. Absent such application, such individuals have to include their investment income in their income tax return and will then be assessed to church tax. For Disbursing Agents, an electronic information system for church withholding tax purposes will apply in relation to investment income received after December 31, 2014, with the effect that church tax will be collected by the Disbursing Agent by way of withholding, unless the holders has filed a blocking notice (Sperrvermerk) with the German Federal Central Tax Office (Bundeszentralamt f¨ur Steuern) in which case the holders will be assessed to church tax. The same treatment applies to capital gains (i.e., the difference between the proceeds from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment after deduction of expenses directly related to the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment and the cost of acquisition, taking into account currency gains and losses, if any) derived by an individual holder who is a German resident irrespective of any holding period, provided the Notes have been held in a custodial account with the same Disbursing Agent since the time of their acquisition. If interest coupons or interest claims are disposed of separately (i.e., without the Notes), the proceeds from the disposition are subject to withholding tax. The same applies to proceeds from the sale or redemption of interest coupons or interest claims if the Notes have been disposed of separately. To the extent the Notes have not been kept in a custodial account with the same Disbursing Agent since the time of their acquisition, upon the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment withholding tax applies at a rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding being 26.375%, plus church tax, if applicable) on 30% of the disposal proceeds (plus interest accrued on the Notes (St¨uckzinsen), if any), unless the Disbursing Agent has been provided with evidence of the actual acquisition costs of the Notes by the previous Disbursing Agent or by a statement of a bank or financial services institution within the European Economic Area or certain other countries in accordance with Art. 17 para. 2 of the Council Directive 2003/48/EC dated June 3, 2003 on the Taxation of Savings Income in the form of interest payments (the ‘‘EU Savings Tax Directive’’) (e.g., Switzerland or Andorra). If the withholding tax on a disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes has been calculated on the basis of 30% of the disposal proceeds (rather than from the actual gain), a German tax resident individual holder may and in case the actual gain is higher than 30% of the disposal proceeds must also apply for an assessment on the basis of his or her actual acquisition costs. In computing any German withholding tax, the Disbursing Agent may generally deduct from the basis of the withholding tax negative investment income realized by the individual holder of the Notes via the Disbursing Agent (e.g., losses from the sale of other securities with the exception of shares). The Disbursing Agent may also deduct accrued interest on the Notes or other securities paid separately upon the acquisition of the respective security via the Disbursing Agent. In addition, subject to certain requirements and restrictions the Disbursing Agent may credit foreign withholding taxes levied on investment income in a given year regarding securities held by the individual holder in the custodial account with the Disbursing Agent. Upon the individual holder filing an exemption certificate (Freistellungsauftrag) with the Disbursing Agent, the Disbursing Agent will take a maximum annual allowance (Sparer-Pauschbetrag) of c801 (c1,602 for married couples filing jointly) into account when computing the amount of tax to be withheld from the gross payment to be made by the Disbursing Agent. No withholding tax will be deducted if the holder of the Notes has submitted to the Disbursing Agent a certificate of non-assessment (Nichtveranlagungsbescheinigung) issued by the competent local tax office. 208 ----- German withholding tax will generally not apply to gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of Notes held by a corporate holder who is a German resident (including via a commercial partnership, as the case may be, and provided that in the case of corporations of certain legal forms the status of corporation has been evidenced by a certificate of the competent tax office) while ongoing payments, such as interest payments, are subject to withholding tax (irrespective of any deductions of foreign tax and losses incurred).

This summary is based on the tax laws of Germany currently in force and as applied on the date of this offering memorandum, which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive or retrospective effect.

887,Offerings 2014.md,62,CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS,62.5,Polish Taxation,62.5.1,Payments under the guarantee to taxpayers subject to limited tax liability in Poland,"Income taxes in Poland are imposed on income of all individuals and corporate bodies. The Polish tax system differentiates unlimited and limited tax liability. Unlimited tax liability means that the taxpayers are subject to taxation in Poland on their entire worldwide income (revenue). Limited tax liability applies to individuals whose place of residence does not lie within the territory of Poland (i.e. individuals who (i) do not have the center of their personal or business interests in Poland, and (ii) do not spend more than 183 days during a fiscal year — being a calendar year — in Poland), as well as corporate income tax payers whose registered office and management are located outside the territory of Poland. Those taxpayers are subject to tax liability only in respect of their income earned within the territory of Poland (from Polish sources of income). Polish tax law provides for withholding tax on payments made to individuals and corporate income tax payers subject to limited tax liability in Poland only with respect to a number of specific types of payments (the ‘‘Withholdable Payments’’), including interest on securities. Polish withholding agent (an entity making payment of interest on securities) shall calculate, deduct and pay to the tax office Polish withholding tax of 19% upon the payment of interest to individual. The same obligation applies with respect to interest payments made to a corporate income tax payer subject to limited tax liability in Poland; however, in such 209 ----- case the withholding tax rate amounts to 20%. A lower withholding tax rate of full exemption may apply, for example, under the relevant double tax treaty. Rules for taxation of payments made by Polish entities under guarantees are imprecise. Withholdable Payments do not expressly include payments made by a guarantor under its obligation resulting from the guarantee. However, payments made by the Polish Guarantors under the Guarantee constitute a fulfilment of the liabilities of the Issuer to the investors under the Notes. Therefore, if a payment from a Polish Guarantor covers the payment of one or more Withholdable Payments, it should be treated in the same way as a payment of the Withholdable Payment(s). Consequently, if the Polish Guarantor makes a payment which covers interest, the Polish tax authorities may consider that the part of the payment which relates to the interest is subject to Polish withholding tax as described above. On the other hand, Polish tax authorities may also classify the payments made by the Polish Guarantors under the Guarantee as constituting, for Polish tax purposes, an independent type of income e.g., ‘‘income from other sources’’. In case of such reclassification of payments made by the Polish Guarantors to individuals or corporate income tax payers subject to limited tax liability in Poland, their income would not be taxable in Poland provided that they are resident in a treaty country, i.e., a country with which Poland has concluded a double tax treaty. 210 -----",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

ERISA imposes certain requirements on ‘‘employee benefit plans’’ (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) subject to ERISA, including entities such as collective investment funds and separate accounts whose underlying assets include the assets of such plans (collectively, ‘‘ERISA Plans’’), and on those persons who are fiduciaries with respect to ERISA Plans. Investments by ERISA Plans are subject to ERISA’s general fiduciary requirements, including the requirements of investment prudence and diversification and the requirement that an ERISA Plan’s investments be made in accordance with the documents governing the ERISA Plan. The prudence of a particular investment must be determined by the responsible fiduciary of an ERISA Plan by taking into account the ERISA Plan’s particular circumstances and all of the facts and circumstances of the investment including, but not limited to, the matters discussed under ‘‘Risk Factors.’’ Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan (as well as those plans that are not subject to ERISA but which are subject to Section 4975 of the Code, such as individual retirement accounts (together with ERISA Plans, the ‘‘Plans’’)) and certain persons (referred to as ‘‘parties in interest’’ or ‘‘disqualified persons’’) having certain relationships to such Plans, unless a statutory or administrative exemption is applicable to the transaction. A party in interest or disqualified person, including a Plan fiduciary, who engages in a prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. The Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar, the Initial Purchaser or any other party to the transactions referred to in this offering memorandum may be parties in interest or disqualified persons with respect to many Plans. Prohibited transactions within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code may arise if any of the Notes is acquired or held by a Plan, including but not limited to where the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar, the Initial Purchaser or any other party to such transactions is a party in interest or a disqualified person. Certain exemptions from the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code may be applicable, however, depending in part on the type of Plan fiduciary making the decision to acquire any Notes and the circumstances under which such decision is made. Included among these exemptions are Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code (relating to transactions between a person that is a party in interest (other than a fiduciary or an affiliate that has or exercises discretionary authority or control or renders investment advice with respect to assets involved in the transaction) solely by reason of providing services to the plan, provided that there is adequate consideration for the transaction), Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption (‘‘PTCE’’) 91-38 (relating to investments by bank collective investment funds), PTCE 84-14 (relating to transactions effected by a qualified professional asset manager), PTCE 95-60 (relating to transactions involving insurance company general accounts), PTCE 90-1 (relating to investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts) and PTCE 96-23 (relating to transactions determined by in-house asset managers). Prospective investors should consult with their advisors regarding the prohibited transaction rules and these exceptions. There can be no assurance that any of these exemptions or any other exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving any Notes. Governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) and non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA), while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to Similar Law. Fiduciaries of any such plans should consult with their counsel before purchasing the Notes to determine the need for, if necessary, and the availability of, any exemptive relief under any Similar Law. In addition, the U.S. Department of Labor has promulgated a regulation, 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101, as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA (the ‘‘Plan Asset Regulation’’), describing what constitutes the assets of a Plan with respect to the Plan’s investment in an entity for purposes of certain provisions of ERISA, including the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA, and Section 4975 of the Code. Under the Plan Asset Regulation, if a Plan invests in an equity interest of an entity that is neither a publicly- offered security nor a security issued by an investment company registered under the United States Investment Company Act of 211 ----- 1940, the Plan’s assets include both the equity interest and an undivided interest in each of the entity’s underlying assets, unless one of the exceptions to such treatment described in the Plan Asset Regulation applies. Under the Plan Asset Regulation, a security which is in the form of debt may be considered an equity interest if it has substantial equity features. If the Group was deemed under the Plan Asset Regulation to hold plan assets (as defined in Section 3(42) of ERISA or any applicable Similar Law, ‘‘Plan Assets’’) by reason of a Plan’s investment in any of the Notes, such Plan Assets would include an undivided interest in the assets held by the Group and transactions by the Group would be subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA and the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code. The Plan Asset Regulation provides, however, that if equity participation in any entity by ‘‘Benefit Plan Investors’’ is not significant, then the ‘‘look-through’’ rule will not apply to such entity. The term ‘‘Benefit Plan Investors’’ is defined in the Plan Asset Regulation to include (1) any employee benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) subject to Title I of ERISA, (2) any plan described in Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code, and (3) any entity whose underlying assets include Plan Assets by reason of any such employee benefit plan or plan’s investment in the entity. Equity participation by Benefit Plan Investors in any entity is significant if, immediately after the most recent acquisition of any equity interest in the entity, 25% or more of the value of any class of equity interests in the entity (excluding the value of any interests held by certain persons, other than Benefit Plan Investors, exercising control over the assets of the entity or providing investment advice to the entity for a fee or any affiliates of such persons) is held by Benefit Plan Investors. If, as a result of any investment, 25% or more of the value of any class of equity interests in the Issuer is being held by Benefit Plan Investors, the applicable Notes may be redeemed by the Issuer. While there is little pertinent authority in this area and no assurance can be given, the Issuer believes that the Notes should not be treated as equity interests for the purposes of the Plan Asset Regulation and, therefore, the Plan Asset Regulation should not apply and any such redemptions would not be necessary. Accordingly, except as otherwise provided in any supplement to this offering memorandum, each purchaser and subsequent transferee of any Notes will represent and warrant, on each day from the date on which the purchaser or transferee acquires such Notes (or any interest therein) through and including the date on which the purchaser or transferee disposes of such Notes (or any interest therein), either that (a) it is not a Plan or any entity whose underlying assets include, or are deemed for purposes of ERISA or the Code to include, Plan Assets or a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan which is subject to any Similar Law or (b) its acquisition, holding and disposition of such Notes (or any interest therein) will not constitute or result in a prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (or, in the case of a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan subject to Similar Law, a violation of any Similar Law) for which an exemption is not available. Each Plan fiduciary who is responsible for making the investment decisions whether to purchase or commit to purchase and to hold any of the Notes should determine whether, under the documents and instruments governing the Plan, an investment in such Notes is appropriate for the Plan, taking into account the overall investment policy of the Plan and the composition of the Plan’s investment portfolio. Any Plan proposing to invest in such Notes (including any governmental, church or non-U.S. plan) should consult with its counsel to confirm that such investment will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction and will satisfy the other requirements of ERISA and the Code (or, in the case of a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan, any Similar Law). The sale of any Notes to a Plan is in no respect a representation by the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar, the Initial Purchaser or any other party to the transactions that such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by Plans generally or any particular Plan, or that such an investment is appropriate for Plans generally or any particular Plan. Any further ERISA considerations with respect to the Notes may be found in the relevant supplement. 212 -----",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Additional Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time.

Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer or the Issuer’s affiliates (including the Additional Notes). Any of Initial Purchaser or its affiliates that have a lending relationship with the Company may hedge their credit exposure to the Company consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchaser and its affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in securities (including potentially the Notes). Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of Additional Notes. The Initial Purchaser and its affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

The United States and the United Kingdom do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of court judgments in civil and commercial matters. A judgment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities law, would not be directly enforceable in England and Wales but such judgment would be treated as constituting a cause of action against the judgment debtor in England and Wales and could be sued on summarily in the English courts. The English courts should enter judgment against the judgment debtor without re-examination of the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court provided: - the relevant U.S. court had jurisdiction to give the judgment; - the judgment is final and conclusive on the merits and is for a definite sum of money (not being a sum payable in respect of taxes or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a fine or other penalty or otherwise based on a U.S. law that an English court considers to be a penal, revenue or other public law); - the judgment is not for multiple damages (as defined by the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980); - the enforcement of such judgment would not contravene public policy in England and Wales; - the enforcement of such judgment is not prohibited by statute (including, without limitation, if the amount of the judgment has been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damage sustained); - the English proceedings were commenced within six years after the date of the judgment; - before the date on which the U.S. court gave judgment, the issues in question had not been the subject of a final judgment of an English court or of a court of another jurisdiction whose judgment is enforceable in England; and - the judgment has not been obtained by fraud or in proceedings, which are in breach of the principles of natural justice; It is uncertain whether an English court would impose liability on a judgment debtor in an action predicated upon the U.S. federal securities law brought in England and Wales. 220 ----- If an English court gives judgment for the sum payable under a U.S. judgment, the English judgment will be enforceable by methods generally available to the English courts for this purpose.

887,Offerings 2014.md,23,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,23.2,Germany,23.2.1,,"We have been advised by our German counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of civil liabilities based on federal or state securities laws of the United States, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. federal or state courts. The United States and the Federal Republic of Germany currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment given by any federal or state court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable, either in whole or in part, in Germany. A conclusive judgment by a U.S. federal or state court, however, may be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung). In such an action, a German court generally will not reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court, except as noted below. The recognition and enforcement of the U.S. judgment by a German court is conditional upon a number of factors, including the following: - U.S. courts could take jurisdiction of the case in accordance with the principles of jurisdictional competence according to German law; - the document introducing the proceedings was duly made known to the defendant in a timely manner that allowed for adequate defense or, in the case of noncompliance with such requirement, (i) the defendant does not invoke such noncompliance or (ii) has nevertheless engaged in the proceedings; - the judgment is not contrary to (i) any prior judgment which became _res judicata rendered by a German court or (ii) any prior judgment which became res judicata rendered by a foreign court which is recognized in Germany and the procedure leading to the respective judgment does not contradict any such prior judgment; - the effects of its recognition will not be in conflict with material principles of German law, including, without limitation, fundamental rights under the constitution of Germany (Grundrechte). In this context, it should be noted that any component of a U.S. federal or state court civil judgment awarding punitive damages or any other damages which do not serve a compensatory purpose, such as treble damages, will not be enforced in Germany. They are regarded to be in conflict with material principles of German law; - the reciprocity of enforcement of judgments is guaranteed; and - the judgment became res judicata in accordance with the law of the place where it was pronounced. Enforcement and foreclosure in Germany based on U.S. judgments may be sought after having received an enforcement decision from a competent German court in accordance with the above principles. Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce judgments in Germany in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be enforceable. Enforcement is also subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation, moratorium as well as other similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally. In addition, it is doubtful whether a German court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. Furthermore, German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of aspects. With respect to the production of evidence, for example, U.S. federal and state law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may, prior to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pre-trial discovery process exists under German law. If the party in whose favor such final judgment is rendered brings a new suit in a competent court in Germany, such party may submit to the German court the final judgment rendered in the United States. Under such circumstances, a judgment by a federal or state court of the United States against the Issuer or such persons will be regarded by a German court only as evidence of the outcome of the dispute to which 221 ----- such judgment relates.

887,Offerings 2014.md,23,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,23.5,Jersey,23.5.1,,"The following summary with respect to the enforceability of certain U.S. court judgments in Jersey is based upon advice provided to us by Jersey legal advisors. As a general rule, foreign judgments, including judgments predicated upon civil liabilities and any judgment obtained in courts outside of Jersey predicated upon U.S. Federal securities laws, cannot be directly enforced in Jersey, although an exception to this rule occurs where the Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) (Jersey) Law 1960 (as amended) (the ‘‘1960 Law’’) applies. The 1960 Law provides for the registration and enforcement in Jersey of judgments given in the superior courts of countries which accord reciprocal treatment to judgments given in Jersey. Presently, the reciprocating countries and their superior courts are as follows: - England and Wales — The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, the House of Lords, the Court of Appeal and the High Court of Justice; - Scotland — The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, the Court of Session and the Sheriff Court; - Northern Ireland — The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, and the Court of Judicature of Northern Ireland; - Isle of Man — Her Majesty’s High Court of Justice of the Isle of Man (including the Staff of Government Division); and - Guernsey — The Royal Court of Guernsey and the Court of Appeal of Guernsey. Not all judgments given by such superior courts can be registered. The registration procedure set out in Part 2 of the 1960 Law applies only to judgments or orders given or made in civil proceedings, or in criminal proceedings for the payment of a sum of money in respect of compensation or damages to an injured party. It does not apply to judgments given by such superior courts on appeal from an inferior court nor, for example, to an English County Court judgment given in proceedings later transferred to the High Court for enforcement. In addition, the judgment must: - be final and conclusive as between the parties (whether or not an appeal in the foreign court is pending or possible); - provide for the payment of a sum of money, but not in respect of taxes or similar charges, or a fine or other penalty; - be for a moneys sum which has not been wholly satisfied; and - be able to be enforced by execution. Further detailed provisions in relation to the enforcement of foreign judgments in Jersey are contained in the 1960 Law. If a foreign judgment falls within Part 2 of the 1960 Law, the judgment creditor must use the registration procedure, as further described in the 1960 Law. Where registration under the 1960 Law, is not available, it will be necessary for a holder of a foreign judgment to commence fresh proceedings in Jersey. While such proceedings would seek to sue on the foreign judgment as a debt and seek summary judgment in respect thereof, the proceedings might involve a re-examination of the merits of the case (such re-examination to be carried out in accordance with relevant principles of private international law). In summary, to enforce a foreign judgment in personam at common law, the judgment must be final and conclusive, for a debt or definite sum of money (but not payable in respect of taxes or similar charges or a fine or other penalty), and given by a court of competent jurisdiction, but must not be impeachable on the grounds of fraud, or contrary to public policy, or natural justice. In Jersey, it has been held that a final and conclusive non-monetary judgment obtained in the courts of any territory deemed to have jurisdiction in accordance with the principles of private international law as applied by Jersey law, may in appropriate circumstances be recognized and enforced by the Jersey court without a substantive re-examination of the merits — there is currently no strict judicial guidance as to what could constitute appropriate circumstances. Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in Jersey judgments in civil and commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that those 223 ----- judgments will be recognized or enforceable in Jersey. In addition, it is questionable whether a Jersey court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in Jersey, instead of the United States, and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

Therefore, the rules of the Polish Code of Civil Procedure shall apply to recognition and enforcement of U.S. court judgments.

Any person who has the so-called legal interest may apply to Polish court with a motion for a decision ascertaining that the judgment of a foreign court is or is not recognized in Poland. The judgment of a foreign court, which is eligible to be enforced, can be enforced in Poland after its enforceability is confirmed by the Polish court. Polish court will confirm the enforceability if: - the judgment of a foreign court is enforceable in the jurisdiction in which it was issued; and - none of the circumstances referred to above (relating to the recognition of the judgments) occurs. Certain judgments of U.S courts (or parts thereof) may be unenforceable or not fully enforceable by Polish courts, or their enforcement can be difficult in practice, in particular: (i) certain forms of specific performance, in particular those which are not recognized or common in Poland, (ii) certain forms (or amounts) of damages or indemnities, in particular, punitive damages or other similar damages or indemnities the amount of which exceeds the actual loss suffered. Judgments (or parts thereof) adjudicating such forms of specific performance or damages or indemnities may be considered as contrary to the fundamental principles of the legal order of the Republic of Poland.

Even though the enforceability of U.S. court judgments outside the United States is described below in respect of those jurisdictions in which each of the Issuer and the Guarantors are currently located, you should consult with your own advisors in any pertinent jurisdictions about the position regarding the enforcement of U.S. judgments there.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

Pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) no. 1346/2000 on insolvency proceedings (the ‘‘EU Insolvency Regulation’’) which applies within the EU (other than Denmark), the court that shall have jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings in respect of a company is the court of the EU Member State (other than Denmark) where the company concerned has its ‘‘center of main interests’’ (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation). The determination of where any such company has its ‘‘center of main interests’’ is a question of fact on which the courts of the different EU Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. The term ‘‘center of main interests’’ is not a static concept but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition. Although there is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that a company has its ‘‘center of main interests’’ in the EU Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary, Preamble 13 of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the ‘‘center of main interests’’ of a company should correspond to the place where the company conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and ‘‘is therefore ascertainable by third parties.’’ In that respect, factors such as where board meetings are held, the location where the company conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the perception of the company’s creditors as regards to the center of the company’s business operations may all be relevant in the determination of the place where the company has its ‘‘center of main interests.’’ If the ‘‘center of main interests’’ of a company, at the time an insolvency application is made, is located in an EU Member State (other than Denmark), only the courts of that EU Member State have jurisdiction to open the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under the EU Insolvency Regulation. The types of insolvency proceedings which may be commenced as main proceedings in the relevant jurisdiction are set out in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Under the EU Insolvency Regulation, insolvency proceedings opened in one EU Member State must be recognized automatically in the other EU Member States (other than Denmark), subject to certain specific exceptions set out in the EU Insolvency Regulation itself. Separately, and in addition to main proceedings, secondary territorial proceedings may be opened in respect of the company in another EU Member State, as set out below. If the ‘‘center of main interests’’ of a company is in one EU Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another EU Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open second territorial proceedings against that company only in the event that such company has an ‘‘establishment’’ (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(h) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other EU Member State. An ‘‘establishment’’ is defined to mean a place of operations where the company carries on non-transitory economic activity with human means and goods. If the main insolvency proceedings have been opened by the court of the EU Member State (other than Denmark) in which the center of main interests of the company is situated, and are outstanding, then the secondary territorial proceedings can only be winding-up proceedings listed in Annex B of the EU Insolvency Regulation. If main insolvency proceedings in the EU Member State (other than Denmark) in which the company has its center of main interests have not yet been opened, independent territorial proceedings could still be opened in another EU Member State (except Denmark) under the specific circumstances set forth in Article 3(4) of the EU Insolvency Regulation. The effects of those territorial proceedings are restricted to the assets of the company situated in the territory of such other EU Member State. If the company does not have an establishment in any other EU Member State, no court of any other EU Member State has jurisdiction to open territorial proceedings in respect of such company under the EU Insolvency Regulation. Irrespective of 225 ----- whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will always, subject to certain exemptions, be governed by the insolvency laws of the EU Member State (other than Denmark) in which the insolvency proceedings of the company are commenced. The courts of all EU Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court opening main proceedings and give the same effect to the order in the relevant EU Member State, so long as no secondary proceedings have been opened there. The insolvency officeholder appointed by a court in an EU Member State that has jurisdiction to open main proceedings (because the company’s center of main interests is there) may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of that Member State in another EU Member State (such as to remove assets of the company from that other EU Member State), subject to certain limitations, as long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in that other EU Member State or any preservation measure taken to the contrary further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other EU Member State where the company has assets. In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, the Guarantors or any of their subsidiaries experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations and the security of the Issuer and the Guarantors.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

Insolvency proceedings must (subject to the further descriptions in this section ‘‘German Insolvency Proceedings’’) be initiated by the debtor and can be initiated by a creditor in the event of over-indebtedness (Uberschuldung[¨] ) of the debtor or in the event of illiquidity (Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit). A debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets unless, based on the prevailing circumstances, a continuation of the business is predominantly likely (¨uberwiegend wahrscheinlich). A company is considered to be illiquid if it is unable to pay its debts when they are due. In addition, only the debtor can file for the opening of insolvency proceedings in case of impending illiquidity (drohende _Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit), if there is the imminent risk of the debtor becoming unable to pay its debts as and_ when they fall due, whereas impending illiquidity does not give rise to an obligation for the management of the debtor or a right of a creditor to file for insolvency proceedings. If a debtor is a GmbH (Gesellschaft mit beschr¨ankter Haftung), a German stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft), a European law stock corporation based in Germany (Societas Europaea — ‘‘SE’’) or any other company not having an individual as a personally liable shareholder gets into a situation of illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness, the managing director(s) of that debtor must file a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings without undue delay but in any event no later than three weeks after that debtor has become illiquid and/or over-indebted. The management of a debtor can be exposed to criminal sanctions as well as damage claims in the event that filings for insolvency are delayed or not made at all. If a company faces imminent illiquidity and/or is over-indebted it may also file for a preliminary ‘‘debtor in possession’’ protection scheme unless — from a third party perspective — there is no reasonable chance of a successful restructuring. In such case and upon request of the debtor, the court will appoint a preliminary trustee (vorl¨aufiger Sachwalter) and prohibit enforcement measures (other than with respect to immoveable assets). It may also implement other preliminary measures to protect the debtor from creditor enforcement actions for up to three months. During that period, the debtor must prepare an insolvency plan which will ideally be implemented in formal ‘‘debtor-in-possession’’ proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) after formal insolvency proceedings have been opened. The insolvency proceedings are court-controlled, and, upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take preliminary protective measures to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings (Insolvenzer¨offnungsverfahren). The court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary proceedings. As part of such protective measures the court may appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorl¨aufiger _Insolvenzverwalter). The rights and duties of the preliminary administrator depend on the decision of the_ 226 ----- court. The duties of the preliminary administrator may be, in particular, to safeguard and preserve the debtor’s property and to assess whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of the insolvency proceedings. Depending on the decision of the court, even the right to manage and dispose of the business and assets of the debtor may pass to the preliminary insolvency administrator. This only applies, where the debtor has not applied for so-called self-administration (Eigenverwaltung), in which event the court will only appoint a preliminary trustee (vorl¨aufiger Sachwalter), who will supervise the management of the affairs by the debtor. During preliminary insolvency proceedings, a ‘‘preliminary creditors’ committee’’ (vorl¨aufiger _Gl¨aubigerausschuss) generally will be appointed by the court if the debtor satisfies two of the following three_ requirements: - a balance sheet total in excess of c4,840,000 (after deducting an equity shortfall if the debtor is over-indebted), - revenues of at least c9,680,000 in the 12 months prior to the last day of the financial year preceding the filing; and/or - 50 or more employees on an annual-average basis. The requirements apply to the entity subject to the proceedings without taking into account the assets of other group companies. The preliminary creditors’ committee will be able to participate in certain important decisions taken during the preliminary insolvency proceedings. It will, for example, have the power to influence the following: the selection of a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorl¨aufiger _Insolvenzverwalter) or an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter), orders for ‘‘self-administration’’_ proceedings (Anordnung der Eigenverwaltung), and the appointment of a preliminary trustee (vorl¨aufiger _Sachwalter). The court opens formal insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzer¨offnung) if certain formal_ requirements are met (in particular, but not limited to, evidence being provided of an existing cause of insolvency) and there are sufficient assets to cover at least the cost of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only open main insolvency proceedings if third parties, for instance creditors, advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for opening of insolvency proceedings will usually be refused for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse). Upon the opening of the insolvency proceedings, an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) is usually appointed by the court who has full administrative and disposal authority over the debtor’s assets unless debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) are ordered. The insolvency administrator may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s operations or may deem it necessary to wind down the Issuer. Satisfaction of these liabilities as preferential debts of the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) will be preferred to any insolvency liabilities created by the debtor prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings. For the holders of the Additional Notes, the most important consequences of such opening of formal insolvency proceedings against a debtor would be the following: - the right to administer and dispose of assets of the Issuer would generally pass to the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative of the insolvency estate; - if the court does not order debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), disposals effected by management of the debtor after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings are null and void by operation of law; - if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings, a creditor in the insolvency proceedings acquires through execution (e.g., attachment) a security interest in part of the debtor’s property that would normally form part of the insolvency estate, such security becomes null and void by operation of law upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings; and - claims against the debtor may generally only be pursued in accordance with the rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). Any person that has a right to segregation (Aussonderung) with respect to any of its assets from the assets in the possession of the debtor does insofar not participate in the insolvency proceedings and the relevant asset does not constitute part of the insolvency estate; the claim for segregation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency administrator. 227 ----- All other creditors, whether secured or unsecured (other than to the extent they have a right to segregate an asset from the insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht) as opposed to a preferential right (Absonderungsrecht)) who wish to assert claims against the debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings. Any individual enforcement action brought against the debtor by any of its creditors other than creditors with preferred claims (Absonderung der Masseverbindlichkeit) is subject to an automatic stay once the insolvency proceedings have been opened (and, if so ordered by a court, also between the time when an insolvency petition is filed and the time when insolvency proceedings commence). Unsecured creditors may file their claims in the insolvency proceedings and will be paid on a pro rata basis from the insolvency estate (to the extent sufficient assets are available). Certain secured creditors have preferential rights regarding the enforcement of their security interests, but German insolvency law imposes certain restrictions on their ability to enforce their security interests outside the insolvency proceedings and in many cases the insolvency administrator will have the sole right to enforce the security. Whether or not a secured creditor remains entitled, after the initiation of insolvency proceedings, to enforce security granted to it by the relevant debtor depends on the type of security. The insolvency administrator generally has, inter alia, the sole right (a) to realize any moveable assets within its possession which are subject to preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) (e.g., movable assets which are subject to a transfer by way of security (Sicherungs¨ubereignung)) as well as (b) to collect any claims that are subject to security assignments (Sicherungsabtretungen). If such enforcement right is vested in the insolvency administrator, the enforcement proceeds, less certain contributory charges for (a) assessing the value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten) and (b) realizing the secured assets (Verwertungskosten) which, in the aggregate, usually add up to 9% of the gross enforcement proceeds (plus VAT (if any)), are paid to the creditor holding the relevant security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. The unencumbered assets of the debtor serve to satisfy the costs of the insolvency proceedings (Massekosten) first and afterwards the preferred creditors of the insolvency estate (Massegl¨aubiger). Typically, liabilities resulting from acts of the insolvency administrator after commencement of formal insolvency proceedings constitute liabilities of the insolvency estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten). Thereafter, all other claims (insolvency claims (Insolvenzforderungen)), in particular claims of unsecured creditors, will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there is cash remaining in the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse). A different distribution of enforcement proceeds can be proposed in an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) that can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and which requires, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the consent of the debtor and the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules. Under German insolvency laws, it is possible to implement a debt-to-equity swap through an insolvency plan. However, it will not be possible to force a creditor into a debt-to-equity swap with regards to the debt owed to it by the debtor if it does not consent to such swap. Creditors secured by pledges over shares in subsidiaries of the debtor are entitled to preferential satisfaction with regard to the proceeds realized in an enforcement process which has to be effected by means of a public auction outside the insolvency process. However, in the absence of authoritative case law, it is uncertain whether the secured creditors are entitled to initiate the enforcement process in respect of the pledged shares on their own or, as far as the pledged assets are part of any insolvency estate, whether the insolvency administrator has standing to realize the pledges on behalf of and for the benefit of the secured creditors. Even if the law vests the right of disposal regarding the relevant collateral in the insolvency administrator, the secured creditor retains the right of preferred satisfaction with regard to the (net) disposal proceeds (Absonderungsrecht). Consequently, the enforcement proceeds minus certain contributory charges as described above are paid to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. Remaining amounts will be allocated to the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) and would, after deduction of the costs of the insolvency proceedings (as described above) and after satisfaction of certain preferential liabilities be distributed among the non-preferential unsecured creditors, including, to the extent their claims exceed the enforcement proceeds of the security interests, the holders of the Additional Notes. If a German subsidiary or a subsidiary subject to German insolvency proceedings grants security over its assets to creditors other than the holders of the Additional Notes, such security may result in a preferred treatment of creditors whose claims are secured by such security. The proceeds resulting from such collateral securing the claims of creditors other than the holders of the Additional Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy the holders of the Additional Notes under a Guarantee granted by the debtors after satisfaction of such secured creditors. The right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) may not necessarily prevent the insolvency administrator from using a moveable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency administrator, however, must compensate the creditor for any loss of value resulting from such use. It may 228 ----- take several years before an insolvency dividend, if any, is distributed to unsecured creditors. An alternative distribution of enforcement proceeds can be proposed in an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) that can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and requires, in principle, the consent of the debtor and the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules. Under German insolvency law, there is no consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency. In the case of a group of companies, each entity, from an insolvency law point of view, has to be dealt with separately (i.e., there is no group insolvency concept under German insolvency law). As a consequence, there is, in particular, no pooling of claims among the various entities of a group or their respective creditors, but rather claims of and vis-`a-vis each entity have to be dealt with separately. Other than secured and unsecured creditors, German insolvency law provides for certain creditors to be subordinated by law (in particular, but not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the relevant debtor for the return of funds or payment of a consideration), while claims of a person who becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings generally rank senior to the claims of regular, unsecured creditors. Powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective upon the opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become unenforceable at such time unless and until the insolvency administrator opts for performance.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

KG (limited partnership with a limited liability company as general partner)(a ‘‘German Guarantor’’) and being an affiliate (but not a direct or indirect shareholder) of the Issuer (i.e., being a direct or indirect subsidiary of the Issuer or of any direct or indirect shareholder of the Issuer without itself being such shareholder) (a ‘‘Relevant Affiliate’’), is subject to certain provisions of the German Limited Liability Company Act (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit _beschr¨ankter Haftung — ‘‘GmbHG’’)._ As a general rule, sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG (‘‘Sections 30 and 31’’) prohibit a GmbH or GmbH & Co. KG from disbursing its assets to its (direct or indirect) shareholders to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s, or in the case of a GmbH & Co. KG, its general partner’s net assets determined in accordance with the provisions of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) (i.e., assets minus liabilities and liability reserves) is or would fall below, or if the disbursement increases or would increase an existing shortfall of, the amount of its stated share capital (Begr¨undung oder Vertiefung einer Unterbilanz). Guarantees and any other security granted by a GmbH or by a GmbH & Co. KG in order to secure the liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company are considered disbursements under Sections 30 and 31. Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to secure the liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Sections 30 and 31 and to protect management from personal liability, it is standard market practice for credit agreements, indentures, guarantees and security documents to contain so-called ‘‘limitation language’’ in relation to subsidiaries incorporated or established in the legal form of a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG in Germany. Pursuant to such limitation language, the beneficiaries of the guarantees or security interests agree to enforce the guarantees or security interests against the German subsidiary only to the extent that such enforcement would not result in the GmbH’s (or, in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, its general partner’s) net assets falling below, or in an increase of an existing shortfall of, its stated share capital (provided that the determination and calculation of such shortfall is subject to certain adjustments and exemptions). Accordingly, any documentation providing for a security interest or a Guarantee provided by a Relevant Affiliate of the Issuer incorporated or established in the legal form of a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG in Germany will contain such limitation language in the manner described. This could lead to a situation in which the respective Guarantee or security granted by a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG cannot be enforced at all. German capital maintenance rules are subject to evolving case law. Future court rulings may further limit the access of a shareholder to assets of its subsidiaries constituted in the form of a GmbH (or of a GmbH & Co. KG, the general partner or general partners of which is or are a GmbH or GmbHs), which can negatively affect the ability of the German (direct or indirect) subsidiaries of the Issuer to make payments under the Guarantees, of the beneficiaries of the Guarantees to enforce the Guarantees or of the secured parties to enforce, or receive or retain the proceeds of the enforcement of, the collateral. 229 -----",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

Such security interests cannot be held for the benefit of a third party by a pledgee which does not itself hold the secured claim. The holders of interests in the Additional Notes from time to time will not be parties to the security documents. In order to permit the holders of the Additional Notes from time to time to benefit from pledges granted to the security agent under German law, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of a ‘‘parallel debt.’’ Pursuant to such parallel debt, the security agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to the sum of any amounts payable by any obligors under, in particular, the Additional Notes and the Indenture (the ‘‘Parallel Debt Obligations’’). The pledges governed by German law will directly and exclusively secure the Parallel Debt Obligations, rather than secure the obligations under the Additional Notes or the claims of the Noteholders directly. The Parallel Debt Obligations are in the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations of the Issuer and the Security Providers under the Additional Notes and the Guarantees (the ‘‘Principal Obligations’’), and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations will discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt Obligations and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt Obligations will discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Although the security agent will have, pursuant to the parallel debt, a claim against the Issuer and the Security Providers for the full principal amount of the Additional Notes, there are no published court decisions confirming the validity of the parallel debt structure and of the pledges granted under German law securing such parallel debt, and hence there is no certainty that German courts will uphold such pledges. Therefore, the ability of the security agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted. In addition, holders of the Additional Notes bear some risk associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the security agent. German law does not generally permit the appropriation of pledged assets by the pledgee upon enforcement of the pledge. The enforcement of a share pledge under German law usually requires the sale of the asset constituting the collateral through a formal process involving a public auction to which certain waiting periods and notice requirements apply. Under German law, it is unclear whether the security interest in the collateral gives the security agent the right to prevent other creditors of the entities having granted such security from foreclosing on and realizing the asset constituting the collateral. Some courts have held that certain types of security interests only give their holders priority (according to their ranking) in the distribution of any proceeds from the realization of the asset constituting the collateral and no right to intervene (i.e., the right to request the court to impose a stay on proceedings initiated by other creditors).",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

On the basis of these rules, an insolvency administrator may challenge (anfechten) transactions which are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Such transactions can include the payment of any amounts to the Noteholders as well as (directly or indirectly) granting them any security interest (including guarantees). The administrator’s right to challenge transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions during the ten-year period prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings. If the Additional Notes, the Guarantees or the security were avoided, holders of the Additional Notes would only have a general unsecured claim in insolvency proceedings in the amount of their original investment and the holders of the Additional Notes would be under an obligation to repay the amounts received out of or for the account or to the detriment of the insolvency estate or to waive such Guarantee or security interest. In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a transaction (Rechtsgesch¨aft) (which terms also include the provision of security or the repayment of debt) may be avoided in the following cases: - any act (Rechtshandlung) granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction for a debt (Befriedigung) if such act was taken (a) during the last three months prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, provided that the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunf¨ahig) at the time when such act was taken and the creditor knew of such illiquidity at such time, or (b) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if the creditor knew of the debtor’s illiquidity or the filing of such petition ; 230 ----- - any act (Rechtshandlung) granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor, to obtain security or satisfaction for a debt where such creditor was not entitled to that security or satisfaction, or which was granted or obtained in a form to which such creditor was not entitled or at a time at which such creditor was not entitled to such security or satisfaction, if (a) such act was taken during the last month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after such filing, (b) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was illiquid at such time, or (c) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such act was detrimental to the other insolvency creditors; - a transaction (Rechtsgesch¨aft) by the debtor that is directly (unmittelbar) detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by which the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against a debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable, if it was entered into (a) during the three months prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid at the time of such transaction and the counterparty to such transaction knew of the illiquidity at such time, or (b) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the counterparty to such transaction knew of either the debtor’s illiquidity or such filing at the time of the transaction; - any act (Rechtshandlung) by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (unentgeltlich) (e.g., whereby a debtor grants security or a guarantee for a third-party debt, which might be regarded as having been granted without consideration), if it was effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings; - any act (Rechtshandlung) performed by the debtor during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing, if the debtor acted with the intention (Vorsatz) to prejudice its insolvency creditors and the other party knew of such intention at the time of such act; - any non-gratuitous (entgeltlich) contract concluded between the debtor and a related party of the debtor which directly (unmittelbar) operates to the detriment (benachteiligen) of the creditors can be avoided unless such contract was concluded more than two years prior to the filing for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the other party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to act to the detriment (benachteiligen) of its creditors; in terms of corporate entities, the term ‘‘related party’’ includes, subject to certain limitations, members of the management or supervisory board, shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, persons or companies holding comparable positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of the debtor, and other persons that are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing persons; - any act (Rechtshandlung) that provides security or satisfaction for a shareholder loan (Gesellschafterdarlehen) made to the debtor or a similar claim if (a) in case of the provision of security, the act took place during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition, or (b) in the case of satisfaction, the act took place during the last year prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition; and - any act (Rechtshandlung) whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to a third party if (a) the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter, and (b) a shareholder of the debtor had granted security or was liable as a guarantor (B¨urge) (in which case the shareholder has to compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)). In this context, ‘‘knowledge’’ is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which the conclusion must be drawn that the debtor was unable to pay its debts generally as they fell due, that a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. A person is deemed to have knowledge of the debtor’s intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors if it knew of the debtor’s imminent illiquidity and that the transaction prejudiced the debtor’s creditors. With respect to a ‘‘related party,’’ there is a general statutory presumption that such party had ‘‘knowledge.’’ Furthermore, even in the absence of an insolvency proceeding, a third-party creditor who has obtained an enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) but has failed to obtain satisfaction of its enforceable claims by a levy of execution, under certain circumstances, has the 231 ----- right to void certain transactions, such as the payment of debt and the granting of security pursuant to the German Code on Avoidance (Anfechtungsgesetz). The conditions for avoidance under the German Code on Avoidance differ to a certain extent from the above-described rules under the German Insolvency Code and the avoidance periods are calculated from the date when a creditor exercises its rights of avoidance in the courts. In addition, under German law, a creditor who provided additional, or extended existing, funding to a debtor or obtained security from a debtor may be liable in tort if such creditor was aware of the debtor’s (impending) insolvency or of circumstances indicating such debtor’s (impending) insolvency at the time such funding was provided or extended or such security was granted. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) held that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor was to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the debtor as the grantor of the guarantee or security was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

Whether security interests labeled as fixed will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating security interests will depend on, among other things, whether the chargee has the requisite degree of control over the relevant chargor’s ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the chargee in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the secured assets without the consent of the chargee prior to crystallization, the court is likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge in the security documents. In addition, to the extent that any of the assets which are expressed to be subject to a fixed charge are not specifically identified, the court may hold that such assets are, in fact, subject to a floating charge.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

Preferential debts therefore have priority over debts secured by a floating charge. If the assets of the relevant company available for the payment of general creditors are insufficient to pay the preferential debts, they are required to be paid out of the property subject to the floating charge. Under Section 98 of the 1963 Act, the holder of a floating charge, or a receiver appointed by such a holder, who takes possession of property subject to the floating charge when the company is not in the course of being wound up, is required to pay the preferential debts out of that property in priority to principal and interest secured by the floating charge. Such preferential debts would comprise, among other things, any amounts owed in respect of local rates and certain amounts owed to the Irish Revenue Commissioners for income/corporation/capital gains tax, value added tax (VAT), employee-related taxes, social security and pension scheme contributions and remuneration, salaries and wages of employees and certain contractors and the expenses of liquidation. In addition, there is a further limited category of super-preferential creditors which take priority, not only over unsecured creditors and holders of floating security, but also over holders of fixed security. These superpreferential claims include the remuneration, costs and expenses properly incurred by any examiner of the company which may include any borrowings made by an examiner to fund the company’s requirements for the duration of his appointment that have been approved by the Irish courts, (see ‘‘— Examinership’’ below) and any capital gains tax payable on the disposition of an asset of the company by a liquidator, receiver or mortgagee in possession. Furthermore, and as referred to above (see ‘‘— Fixed and Floating Charges’’), in the case of the application of moneys arising from the realization of secured assets that are subject to a floating charge, or in a winding-up, the costs of the liquidation and the liquidator’s fees will take priority over the claims of floating chargeholders in respect of relevant assets.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

In circumstances where an Irish company is or is likely to be unable to pay its debts, then that company, the directors of that company, a contingent, prospective or actual creditor of that company, or shareholders of that company holding, at the date of presentation of the petition, not less than one-tenth of the voting share capital of that company are each entitled to petition the court for the appointment of an examiner to that company. Provided the company can demonstrate viability, and can satisfy certain tests, the Irish High Court or, in the case of certain small companies, the Irish Circuit Court (each, a ‘‘Court’’) appoints an independent examiner whose function is to supervise the restructuring process. Where the Court appoints an examiner to a company, it may, at the same or any time thereafter, make an order appointing the examiner to be examiner for the purposes of the 1990 Amendment Act to a related company of such company. Once confirmed by the Court the scheme is binding on the company and all its members and creditors. During the protection period the day-to-day business of the company remains under the control of the directors of the company, subject to certain rights of the examiner to apply to the Court. The examiner, once appointed, has the power to set aside contracts and arrangements entered into by the company after this appointment and, in certain circumstances, can avoid a negative pledge given by the company prior to this appointment. Furthermore, the examiner may sell assets of the company which are the 233 ----- subject of security. Where such assets are the subject of a fixed security interest, the examiner must account to the holders of the fixed security interest for the amount realized and discharge the amount due to the holders of the fixed security interest out of the proceeds of the sale. During the period of protection, the examiner will formulate proposals for a compromise or scheme of arrangement to assist the survival of the company, or of a related company, or both, and the whole or any part of its or their undertaking as a going concern. A scheme of arrangement may be approved by the Court when at least one class of creditors who would be adversely affected by the scheme of arrangement has voted in favor of the proposals and the Court is satisfied that such proposals are (i) fair and equitable in relation to any class of members or creditors who have not accepted the proposals and whose interests would be impaired by implementation of the scheme of arrangement and (ii) not unfairly prejudicial to the interests of any interested party. For as long as a company is under the protection of the Court, no attachment, sequestration, distress or execution shall be put into force against the property or effects of the relevant company except with the consent of the examiner. In addition, no proceedings of any sort may be commenced against a guarantor or any other person liable to pay all or any part of the debts of the company under protection in respect of the debts of that company. This moratorium under the 1990 Amendment Act runs for an initial period of 70 days from the date of the presentation of the petition to the court for the appointment of the examiner. An extension of up to 30 days can be granted on application to the court by the examiner and the period may be further extended by the court for such period as the court considers necessary to decide whether or not to confirm the proposals. _Primary Risks for Holders of Additional Notes in an Examinership_ The primary risks to the holders of the Additional Notes, under the laws of Ireland, if an examiner were appointed to an Irish Guarantor and/or to a company related to such an Irish company and where any amounts due under the Additional Notes were unpaid, are as follows: (a) there may be a delay in enforcing the payment obligations of an Irish Guarantor of the Additional Notes and of any payment obligations contained in a guarantee given by any other related company subject to the examinership proceedings; (b) the potential for a compromise or scheme of arrangement being approved involving the writing down or rescheduling of the debt due by an Irish Guarantor to the holders of the Additional Notes; (c) the potential for a compromise or scheme of arrangement being approved involving the writing down or rescheduling of any payment obligations owed to the holders of the Additional Notes by a company related to such an Irish Guarantor; (d) the potential for the examiner to seek to set aside any negative pledge prohibiting the creation of security or the incurring of borrowings by the Irish Guarantor to enable the examiner to borrow to fund the guarantor during the protection period; and (e) in the event that a scheme of arrangement is not approved in respect of an Irish company guarantor of the Additional Notes and the guarantor subsequently goes into liquidation, the examiner’s remuneration and expenses (including certain borrowings incurred by the examiner on behalf of the guarantor and approved by the Court) will take priority over the moneys and liabilities which from time to time are or may become due, owing or payable by it to the holders of the Additional Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

In most cases this will only arise if an examiner or a liquidator is appointed to the Irish company within a specified period (as set out in more detail below) of the granting of the security and, in addition, the company was ‘‘unable to pay its debts’’ when the security interest was granted or ‘‘unable to pay its debts’’ as a result. A company will be ‘‘unable to pay its debts’’ if a statutory demand for an amount over c1,270 (approximately) is served on the company and remains unsatisfied for three weeks or an execution order or other process issued on a judgment, decree or order of a court in favor of a creditor is returned unsatisfied in whole or in part or it is proved to the court’s satisfaction that the company is not able to pay its debts as they fall due or that the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities (taking into account contingent and prospective liabilities). 234 ----- The following potential grounds for challenge may apply to security interests: _Fraudulent Preference_ Under Irish insolvency law, if an Irish company goes into liquidation, a liquidator may apply to the court for an order to set aside certain transactions entered into by an Irish company before the commencement of liquidation on the grounds that such transaction constituted a fraudulent preference. Section 286 of the 1963 Act provides that any conveyance, mortgage, delivery of goods, payment, execution or other act relating to property made or done by or against a company which is unable to pay its debts as they become due, to any creditor, within six months of the commencement of a winding-up of the Irish company, with a view to giving such creditor (or any surety or guarantor of the debt due to such creditor) a preference over its other creditors shall, if the company is at the time of the commencement of the winding-up unable to pay its debts (taking into account the contingent and prospective liabilities), be deemed a fraudulent preference of its creditors and be invalid accordingly. Where the conveyance, mortgage, delivery of goods, payment, execution or other action is in favor of a ‘‘connected person’’ the six-month period is extended to two years. _Transaction Defrauding Creditors_ Under Section 139 of the Irish Companies Act 1990, if in a liquidation, receivership or examination of an Irish company it can be shown to the satisfaction of the court that any property of such company of any kind whatsoever was disposed of either by way of conveyance, transfer, mortgage, security, loan or in any way whatsoever whether by act or omission, direct or indirect, and that the effect of such disposal was to perpetrate a fraud on the Irish company, its creditors or members, the court may, if it deems it just and equitable to do so, order any person who appears to have the use, control or possession of such property or the proceeds of the sale or development thereof to deliver it or to pay a sum in respect of it to the relevant insolvency officer (or other applicant, which could include a creditor or contributory) under such terms or conditions as the court sees fit. In deciding whether it is just and equitable to make an order under Section 139 of the Irish Companies Act 1990, the Irish High Court must have regard to the rights of persons who have bona fide and for value acquired an interest in the property the subject of the application. Section 139 does not apply to a disposal that would constitute a fraudulent preference for the purpose of Section 286 of the 1963 Act. _Grant of Floating Charge_ Under Irish insolvency law, if an Irish company is unable to pay its debts at the time of (or as a result of) granting a floating charge, then such floating charge can be avoided if it was granted in the period of one year ending with the onset of insolvency (except to the extent of moneys actually advanced or paid or the actual price or value of the goods or services sold or supplied to the Irish company at the time of or subsequent to the creation of, and in consideration for, the charge, together with interest on that amount at the rate of 5% per annum). Where the floating charge is granted to a ‘‘connected person’’ the charge can be challenged if granted within two years of the onset of insolvency. _General_ If an Irish Guarantor becomes subject to an Irish law insolvency proceeding and that company has obligations to creditors that are treated under Irish law as senior relative to the company’s obligations to the Noteholders, the Noteholders may suffer losses as a result of their subordinated status during such insolvency proceeding. The validity and enforceability of a guarantee or security interest may be contested on the basis of an _ultra vires claim. It is important in this regard that any Guarantor incorporated under the laws of Ireland has_ sufficient powers in its Memorandum of Association to give guarantees and indemnities and to create security over its assets. Subject to certain exceptions, under Section 60 of the 1963 Act, it is unlawful for an Irish company to give, whether directly or indirectly, and whether by means of a loan, guarantee, the provision of security or otherwise, any financial assistance for the purpose of or in connection with a purchase or subscription made or to be made by any person or for any shares in the company or its holding company. Pursuant to Section 1001 of the Irish Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (as amended), the holder of a fixed security over book debts of an Irish tax-resident company may be required by notice from the Irish Revenue Commissioners to pay to them sums equivalent to those which the holder thereafter receives in payment of 235 ----- debts due to it by the relevant company. Where the holder of the security has informed the Irish Revenue Commissioners of the creation of the security within 21 days of its creation, the holder’s liability is limited to the amount of certain outstanding Irish tax liabilities of the company (including liabilities in respect of value added tax) arising after the issue to the holder of a notice from the Irish Revenue Commissioners. The Irish Revenue Commissioners may also attach any debt due to an Irish tax-resident company by another person in order to discharge any liabilities of the company in respect of outstanding tax whether the liabilities are due on its own account or as an agent or trustee. It is possible that the scope of this right of the Irish Revenue Commissioners may override the rights of holders of security (whether fixed or floating) over the debt in question.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

Receivers are appointed over assets which fall within the security granted, and not over the company itself. The appointment of a receiver could result in the costs and expenses of the receiver taking priority over any amounts otherwise owed to holders of the Additional Notes. _Additional Notes Guarantees_ There is a risk that the Guarantees may be challenged as unenforceable on the basis that there is an absence of corporate benefit on the part of an Irish Guarantor or that it is not for the purpose of carrying on the business of the Irish Guarantor. The directors’ primary duty is to act in the best interests of their own company and not in the interest of the group as a whole. Nevertheless, it is often to the advantage of one company to support other members of the group and the Irish courts have held that corporate benefit may be established where the benefit flows to the group generally rather than specifically to the relevant Irish guarantor.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

Therefore, any main insolvency proceedings in respect of any Irish Guarantor would likely be commenced and conducted in accordance with the requirements of Irish insolvency laws.

In Italy, the courts play a central role in the insolvency process and in-court procedures may be materially more complex and time-consuming than in equivalent situations in jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Italy, which does not include special provisions applying to banks, insurance and other companies authorized to carry out certain reserved activities nor it provides a comprehensive description of insolvency laws application where public companies are involved. The two primary aims of Royal Decree No. 267 of March 16, 1942 (the main Italian bankruptcy legislation), as reformed and currently in force (the ‘‘Italian Bankruptcy Law’’), are to liquidate the debtor’s assets and protect the goodwill of the going concern (if any) for the satisfaction of creditors’ claims as well as, in case of the ‘‘Prodi-bis’’ procedure or ‘‘Marzano’’ procedure, to maintain employment. These competing aims have often been balanced by selling businesses as going concerns and ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold. Insolvency proceedings are only applicable to enterprises (imprese) either run by companies, partnerships or by individuals. Under the Italian Bankruptcy Law, bankruptcy must be declared by a court, based on the insolvency (insolvenza) of a company upon a petition filed by the company itself, the public prosecutor and/or one or more creditors. Insolvency occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations as they become due. This must be a permanent, and not a temporary, status in order for a court to hold that a company is insolvent. Conversely, the state of crisis (stato di crisi) is broader in that it can be temporary and reversible. 237 ----- The following forms of debt restructuring and bankruptcy are available under Italian law for companies in a state of crisis and for insolvent companies. Italian Bankruptcy Law applies to enterprises (imprese) either run by companies, partnerships or by individuals. _Restructuring Outside of a Judicial Process (accordi stragiudiziali)_ Restructuring generally takes place through a formal judicial process because it is more favorable for the debtor and because informal arrangements put in place to effect an out-of-court restructuring are susceptible to being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions. However, in cases where a company is solvent, but facing financial difficulties, it may be possible for it to enter into an out-of-court arrangement with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company. _Out-of-court Reorganization Plans (Piani di risanamento) pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law_ Out-of-court reorganization plans (piani di risanamento) are based on restructuring plans (piani di _risanamento attestati) prepared by companies in order to restructure their indebtedness and to ensure the_ recovery of their financial condition. An independent expert appointed directly by the debtor has to verify the feasibility of the restructuring plan and the truthfulness of the business data provided by the company. There is no need to obtain court approval to appoint the expert; nevertheless, the expert can only be selected and appointed among those possessing certain specific professional requisites and qualifications (i.e. being registered in the auditors’ registrer), and meeting the requirements under Article 2399 of the Italian Civil Code. The expert may be subject to liability in case of misrepresentation or false certification. The terms and conditions of these out-of-court reorganization plans are freely negotiable. Unlike courtsupervised pre-bankruptcy compositions with creditors and debt restructuring agreements (see below), out-of-court reorganization plans do not offer the debtor any protection against enforcement proceedings and/or precautionary actions of third-party creditors. The Italian Bankruptcy Law provides that, should these plans fail and the debtor be declared bankrupt, the payments and/or acts carried out for the implementation of the reorganization plan, subject to certain conditions are (i) not subject to claw-back action and (ii) exempted from certain potentially applicable criminal sanctions. Neither ratification by the court nor publication in the Companies’ Register are needed (although publication in the Companies’ Register is possible upon debtor’s request) and, therefore, the risk of bad publicity or disvalue judgments are lower than in case of an court-supervised pre-bankruptcy compositions with creditors or a debt restructuring agreement (see below). _Debt Restructuring Agreements with Creditors (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti) pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law_ Debt restructuring agreements with creditors (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti) entered into with creditors representing at least 60% of the outstanding company’s debts can be ratified (omologati) by the court, provided that an expert appointed by the debtor assesses the truthfulness of the business data provided by the company and declares that the agreement is feasible and, particularly, that it ensures that the debts of the non-participating creditors can be fully satisfied within the following time frames: (i) 120 days from the date of ratification of the agreement by the court, in the case of debts which are due and payable to the non-participating creditors as at the date of the ratification (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court; and (ii) 120 days from the date on which the relevant debts fall due, in case of receivables which are not yet due and payable to the non-participating creditors as of the date of the ratification of the debt restructuring agreement by the court. Only a debtor who is insolvent or in a state of crisis can initiate this process and request the court’s ratification of the debt restructuring agreement entered into with its creditors. The debt restructuring agreement is published in the companies’ register and becomes effective as of the day of its publication. Starting from the date of such publication and for 60 days thereafter, creditors cannot start or continue any interim relief or enforcement actions over the assets of the debtor and cannot obtain any security interest (unless agreed) in relation to pre-existing debts. Such moratorium can be requested, pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, to the court by the debtor pending negotiations with creditors (prior to the above-mentioned publication of the agreement), subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions. Such moratorium request must be published in the companies’ register and 238 ----- becomes effective as of the date of publication. The court, having verified the completeness of the documentation, sets the date for a hearing within 30 days of the publication and orders the debtor to supply to the creditors the relevant documentation in relation to the moratorium. In such hearing, creditors and other interested parties may file an opposition to the agreement and the court assesses whether the conditions for granting the moratorium have been met and, if they have, orders that no interim relief or enforcement action may be started or continued, nor can security interests (unless agreed) be acquired over the assets of the debtor, and sets a deadline (not exceeding 60 days) by which the restructuring agreement has to be filed. The court’s decree may be challenged within 15 days of its publication. Within the same deadline of 60 days, an application for the court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (as described below) may be filed, without prejudice to the effect of the moratorium. Creditors and other interested parties may oppose to the agreement within 30 days of its publication with the competent Companies’ register. The court shall, after having settled the opposition (if any), validate the debt restructuring agreement by issuing a decree which may be opposed within the following 15 days of its publication. The Italian Bankruptcy Law does not expressly provide for any indications concerning the contents of the debt restructuring agreement. The plan can therefore provide, inter alia, either for the prosecution of the business by the debtor or by a third party, or the sale of the business to a third party and may contain, business refinancing agreements, moratoria, write-offs and/or postponements of claims. The debt restructuring agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. Pursuant to Article 182-quater of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, financings granted to a debtor ‘‘in execution of’’ (in esecuzione di) a debt restructuring agreement, as well as of a court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo), benefit of a super senior status. Additionally, even the financings granted ‘‘in view of’’ (in funzione di) the filing of a petition for the ratification (i.e. omologazione) of a debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis or a concordato _preventivo benefit of the same super senior status in case of subsequent bankruptcy of the debtor where_ such financings are contemplated under the underlying restructuring plan and the super priority status is expressly recognized by the court in the context of the ratification (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement or the approval of the concordato preventivo. Same provisions apply to financings granted by shareholders up to 80% of their amount. Moreover, pursuant to the new Article 182-quinquies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the court, pending the ratification (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1, or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or a petition pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6, (in relation to the court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) described below) may authorize the debtor, if so expressly requested: (i) to incur in new super senior indebtedness and to secure such indebtedness with in rem security (‘‘garanzie reali’’), provided that the expert appointed by the debtor declares that the new financing aims at providing a better satisfaction of the creditors, and (ii) to pay pre-existing debts deriving from the supply of services or goods, already payable and due, provided that the expert declares that such payments are essential for the company to operate. This possibility may be available to the applicant whereas its business activity is kept as a going concern. It should be specified that the provision of Article 182-quinquies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law applies to both debt restructuring agreements and to court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo). _Court-Supervised Pre-bankruptcy Composition with Creditors (concordato preventivo)_ A company which is insolvent or in a state of crisis, but has not been declared insolvent by the court, has the option to make a composition proposal to its creditors, under court supervision, in order to compose its overall indebtedness and/or reorganize its business, thereby avoiding a declaration of insolvency and the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings. Only the debtor company can file a petition with the court for a _concordato preventivo; the proposal must be filed with a plan and the other relevant documentation and is_ accompanied by a report of an independent expert (who meets specific professional and independence requirements) assessing the feasibility of the composition proposal and the truthfulness of the business data provided by the company. The petition for concordato preventivo is then published in the companies’ register. Between the publishing in the companies’ register of the concordato preventivo proposal and its final sanction by the court, all enforcement and interim relief actions by the creditors (whose title to enforcement 239 ----- arose before filing with the court) are stayed. In addition, during this time, pre-existing creditors cannot obtain security interests(unless authorized by the court) and mortgages registered within 90 days preceding the date on which the petition for the concordato preventivo is published in the Italian companies’ register are ineffective against prepetition creditors. By the deadline to file the complete _concordato preventivo, the debtor may also file an_ _accordo di _ristrutturazione dei debiti._ The composition proposal filed in connection with the petition may provide for: (i) the restructuring of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims (including through extraordinary transactions, such as the granting to creditors and to their subsidiaries or affiliated companies of shares, bonds (including bonds convertible into shares), or other financial instruments and debt securities); (ii) the transfer to a receiver (assuntore) of the operations of the debtor company making the composition proposal; (iii) the division of creditors into classes and (iv) different treatment of creditors belonging to different classes. The composition proposal may propose that (i) the debtor’s company’s business continues to be run by the debtor’s company as a going concern, or (ii) the business is transferred to one or more companies and any assets which are no longer necessary to run the business are liquidated (concordato con continuit`a aziendale). In these cases, the petition for the concordato preventivo should fully describe the costs and revenues which are expected as a consequence of the continuation of the business as a going concern, as well as the financial resources and support which will be necessary. The report of the independent expert shall also certify that the continuation of the business is conducive to the satisfaction of creditors’ claims to a greater extent than if such composition proposal was not implemented. Furthermore the going concern-based arrangement with creditors can provide also the winding-up of those assets which are not functional to the business. The arrangement agreement may also provide a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. In case of a concordato preventivo con continuit`a aziendale, the plan may provide for a moratorium of up to one year for the payment of creditors which benefit from a privilege (privilegio), pledge (pegno) or mortgage (ipoteca). If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a judge (giudice delegato) to supervise the procedure, appoints one or more judicial officers (commissari giudiziali) and calls a creditors’ meeting. During the implementation of the proposal, the company generally continues to be managed by its board of directors, but is supervised by the appointed judicial officers and judge (who shall authorize all transactions that exceed the ordinary course of business). The debtor is allowed to carry out urgent extraordinary transactions only upon the prior court’s authorization, while ordinary transactions may be carried out without authorizations. Third party claims, related to the interim acts legally carried out by the debtor, are treated as super senior (prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The concordato preventivo is voted on at a creditors’ meeting and must be approved by the majority (by value of claims) of the creditors entitled to vote and, where there are different classes of creditors also, by the majority of classes. Creditors who have not voted will be deemed to approve the concordato preventivo proposal if they fail to notify their objection via telegraph, fax, mail or e-mail to such proposal within 20 days from the relevant meeting. Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of _concordato _preventivo unless and to the extent they waive their security, or the concordato preventivo provides that they_ will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the non-secured part of their debt. The court may also approve the _concordato preventivo (notwithstanding the circumstance that one or more classes objected to it) if (i) the majority of classes has approved it, and (ii) the court deems that the interests of the dissenting creditors would be adequately safeguarded by it compared to other solutions. If an objection to the implementation of the concordato preventivo is filed by creditors or, if there are different classes of creditors, by a creditor belonging to a dissenting class, representing at least 20% of the claims entitled to vote, the court may nevertheless sanction the concordato preventivo if it deems that the relevant creditors’ claims are likely to be satisfied to a greater extent as a result of the concordato preventivo than would otherwise be the case. After the approval by the creditors’ meeting, the court (having settled possible objections raised by the dissenting creditors, if any) approves the concordato preventivo proposal by issuing a confirmation order. If the creditors’ meeting does not approve the _concordato preventivo, the court may, upon request of the public prosecutor or a creditor, and if it has verified that the relevant conditions have been met, declare the 240 ----- company bankrupt. Payments and transactions carried out under a court ratified concordato preventivo are not subject to claw-back action (see below). _Pre-application for the composition with creditors (concordato preventivo), even in view of a debt restructuring agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione del debito)_ Pursuant to recent amendments to the Italian Bankruptcy Law (Law Decree 22 June 2012, no. 83 and Law Decree 21 June 2013, no. 69), the debtor may, upon filing the petition, limit the accompanying documents to the financial statements for the last three years and the list of creditors (along with the amount of the relevant receivables), and submit the composition scheme, the plan and the remaining documentation at a later stage within the deadline set by the court (so-called ‘‘blank (in bianco) petition’’). Pursuant to article 161, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, such deadline may vary from 60 to 120 days and may be deferred for further 60 days only on reasonable grounds. Within such term, the debtor may, at its discretion, also file the application for a debt restructuring agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) in lieu of the proposal for the concordato preventivo. The ‘‘blank petition’’ allows the debtor to file a petition to initiate pre-bankruptcy agreement proceedings with an immediate ‘‘automatic stay’’ effect, but without filing the relevant proposal, plan and ancillary documentation, which can be delivered at a later stage. In the decree providing for such term, the court may appoint a judicial commissioner to monitor the company. The debtor company may not file such pre-application if it has already done so in the previous two years without the admission to the composition with creditors (or the certification of a debt restructuring agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione del debito)) having followed. The decree setting the term for the presentation of the documentation contains also the periodical information requirements (relating also to the financial management of the company) that the company has to fulfill, at least on a monthly basis, until the lapse of the term established by the court. Non-compliance with these requirements results in the application for the court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) being declared inadmissible and, upon request of the creditors or the public prosecutor and _provided that the relevant requirements exist, in the adjudication of the distressed company to bankruptcy. Following the filing of the pre-application and until the decree of admission to the composition with creditors, the distressed company may (i) carry out acts pertaining to its ordinary activity and (ii) seek the court’s authorization to carry out acts pertaining to its extraordinary activity, to the extent they are urgent. Receivables arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company are treated as super-senior (prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the related acts, payments and security interests granted are exempted from the claw-back action provided under Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. Pursuant to article 169-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the debtor may request the competent court to be authorized to terminate outstanding agreements (contratti in corso di esecuzione), except for certain agreements which are excluded from the scope of the above provision (e.g. employment agreements (rapporti di lavoro subordinato)). The request may be filed with the competent court at the time of the filing of the application for the concordato preventivo or to the judge (giudice delegato), if the application is made after admission to the procedure. Upon the debtor’s request, the pending agreements can also be suspended for a period of time not exceeding 60 days, renewable just once. In such circumstances, the other party has the right to receive an indemnification equivalent to the damages suffered for the non-fulfillment of the agreement. Such indemnification would be paid as a credit preceding the admission to the pre-bankruptcy composition. _Bankruptcy (fallimento)_ A request to declare a debtor bankrupt and to commence a bankruptcy proceeding (fallimento) and the judicial liquidation of the debtor company’s assets can be filed by the debtor company itself, any of its creditors and, in certain cases, by the public prosecutor. The bankruptcy is declared by the competent bankruptcy court. The Italian Bankruptcy Law is applicable only to commercial enterprises (imprenditori _commerciali) if any of the following thresholds are met: the debtor (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in_ an aggregate amount exceeding c0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, (ii) has had gross revenues (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding c0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of c0.5 million. 241 ----- On the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings: - subject to certain exceptions, all actions of creditors are stayed and creditors must file claims within a defined period. In particular, under certain circumstances, secured creditors (creditori garantiti da _pegno o assistiti da privilegio) may enforce their priority rights in respect of the charged assets as soon_ as their claims are admitted as preferred claims. Secured claims are paid out of the proceeds deriving from the liquidation of the charged assets, together with interest and expenses. Any outstanding balance will be considered unsecured and rank pari passu with all of the bankrupt’s other unsecured debt. The secured creditor may sell the secured asset only after it has obtained authorization from the designated judge (giudice delegato). After hearing the bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare) and the creditors’ committee, the designated judge decides whether to authorize the sale, and sets forth the timing in its decision; - the administration of the debtor and the management of its assets pass from the debtor company to the bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare); - any act of disposition or transaction entered into by the debtor made after a declaration of bankruptcy (including payments made) is ineffective against the creditors; - as a general rule and subject to certain exceptions, the receiver is allowed to terminate contracts with third parties where some or all of the obligations of the insolvent debtor have not been performed; and - the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the bankruptcy declaration are suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over. Although the general rule is that the bankruptcy receiver is allowed to either continue or terminate contracts where some or all of the obligations have not been performed by both parties, certain contracts are subject to specific rules expressly provided for by the Italian Bankruptcy Law. Any contractual provision granting a party the right of termination of the relevant contract in case of insolvency of the other party is ineffective (article 72, sub-section 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law). The bankruptcy proceedings are carried out and supervised by a court-appointed bankruptcy receiver, a deputy judge (giudice delegato) and a creditors’ committee. The bankruptcy receiver is not a representative of any one of the creditors, but is responsible for the liquidation of the assets of the debtor for the satisfaction of the creditors as a whole. The proceeds from the liquidation are distributed in accordance with statutory priority. The liquidation of a debtor can take a considerable amount of time, particularly in cases where the debtor’s assets include real estate property. The Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for priority of payment to certain preferential creditors, including administrative costs associated with the bankruptcy proceeding and costs related to the receiver’s running of the company, Italian tax and national social security contributions and employee arrears of wages or salary. Unsecured creditors are therefore satisfied after payment of preferential and secured creditors, out of available funds and assets (if any) as below indicated. _Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors (concordato fallimentare)_ A bankruptcy proceeding can terminate prior to liquidation through a bankruptcy composition proposal with creditors. The proposal can be filed, by one or more creditors or third parties, from the declaration of bankruptcy. By contrast, the debtor or its subsidiaries are only permitted to file such proposal after one year following such declaration, but within two years following the decree giving effectiveness to the liabilities account (stato passivo). Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato fallimentare, unless and to the extent they waive their security or the concordato fallimentare provides that they will not receive full satisfaction based on the fair market value of their charged assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their unsecured debt. The proposal may provide for: (a) the splitting of the creditors into different classes and different treatment for creditors who belong to different classes; (b) the restructuring of the debts and the payment of the creditors in whatever possible way including the assignment of (all or part of) the debtor’s assets to the creditors or the assignment of (all or part of) the liabilities to a third party (accollo) or any other corporate reorganization such as the conversion of debt into equity (azioni o quote), (convertible) notes or any other financial instrument; (c) the assignment to creditors of (all or part of) the recovery/claw-back actions started by the Receiver; and (d) only partial satisfaction of the claims of the secured creditors, provided that such creditors would not be able to obtain greater satisfaction of their claims from the sale of the debtor’s assets given as security based 242 ----- on the market value assessed by an independent expert and that, in any case, the rules on priority of payment are not affected. The concordato fallimentare proposal must be approved by the creditors’ committee and the creditors holding the majority (by value) of claims (and, if classes are formed, also by a majority (by value) of the claims in a majority of the classes). Final court ratification is also required. _Statutory Priorities_ The statutory priority given to creditors under the Italian Bankruptcy Law may be different from that established in the United States, the United Kingdom and certain other EU jurisdictions. Under Italian law, the highest priority claims (after the costs of the proceedings are paid, including the costs related to the receiver’s running of the company during the proceedings) are the claims of preferential creditors including the claims of the Italian tax authorities and social security administrators, and claims for employee wages. The claims of secured creditors have priority, subject to certain claims preferred by operation of law, on the proceeds deriving from the liquidation of the secured assets, net of administrative and maintenance costs incurred during the proceedings by the receiver to preserve the value of the secured assets. To the extent the proceeds of the sale of the secured assets are not sufficient to fully satisfy the secured claim, the latter will participate with the unsecured creditors in the distribution of the proceeds of the disposal of the remaining assets. Neither the debtor nor the court can deviate from the rules of statutory priority by proposing their own priorities of claims or by subordinating one claim to another based on equitable subordination principles (as a consequence it must be noted that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements may not be enforceable against an Italian bankruptcy estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities provided by law). The rules of statutory priority apply irrespective of whether the proceeds are derived from the sale of the entire bankrupt’s estate or part thereof, or from a single asset. Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law establishes that proceeds of liquidation shall be allocated in a precise order. The highest priority claims, after the costs of the proceedings are paid, among the preferential creditors are pre-deductible claims (crediti prededucibili) which concern credits arisen with the approval of the receiver after the proceedings have commenced and credits which are defined as pre-deductible (prededucibili) by law. The remaining priority claims are, in order of priority, those of (i) secured creditors, including privileged creditors (creditori privilegiati; a priority in payment in most circumstances, but not exclusively, provided for by law), which include the claims of the Italian tax authorities and social security administrators, and claims for employee wages that arose before the insolvency has been declared (including severance pay), mortgagees (creditori ipotecari) and pledgees (creditori prignoratizi) and (ii) unsecured creditors (crediti chirografari). _Avoidance Powers in Insolvency_ Under Italian law, there are claw-back (revocatoria fallimentare) provisions, that may lead to, inter alia, the revocation of payments made, or security interests granted, by the debtor prior to the declaration of bankruptcy, or avoidance provisions, that concern transactions made below market value, preferential transactions and transactions made with a view to defraud creditors. Claw-back rules under Italian law are normally considered to be particularly favorable to the receiver in bankruptcy, compared to the rules applicable in other jurisdictions. In a bankruptcy proceeding, depending on the circumstances, the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a claw-back period of up to either one year or six months depending on the circumstances (please note that in the context of extraordinary administration procedures — see sections below — in relation to certain transactions the claw-back period can be extended to five and three years, respectively) and a two-year ineffectiveness period for certain other transactions. The Italian Bankruptcy Law distinguishes between acts or transactions which may be declared ineffective and acts or transactions which may be clawed-back (revocati) at the request of the bankruptcy receiver/court commissioner, as detailed below. (A) Acts ineffective by operation of law: (i) under Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, all transactions without consideration are ineffective vis-`a-vis creditors if entered into by the debtor in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration; and (ii) under Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of debts falling due on the day of the declaration of insolvency or thereafter are deemed ineffective _vis-`a-vis creditors if made by the debtor in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. 243 ----- (B) Acts which could be clawed-back at the request of the bankruptcy receiver/court commissioner (i) The following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below, may be clawed back (revocati) unless the other party proves that it had no actual or constructive knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency: I. the onerous transactions entered into in the year preceding the insolvency declaration, where the value of the debt or of the obligations undertaken by the debtor exceed by 25% the value of the consideration received by, or promised to, the debtor; II. payments of debts, due and payable, made by the debtor, which were not paid in cash or by other customary means of payment in the year preceding the insolvency declaration; III. pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the year preceding the insolvency declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which had not yet fallen due; and IV. pledges and mortgages, granted by the bankrupt entity in the six months preceding the insolvency declaration, in order to secure debts which had fallen due. (ii) The following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below, may be clawed-back (revocati) if the bankruptcy receiver proves that the other party had actual or constructive knowledge that the bankrupt entity was insolvent at the time of the act or transaction: I. the payments of debts due and payable and onerous transactions entered into or made in the six months preceding the insolvency declaration; and II. the granting of security interests securing debts (even those of third parties) created simultaneously with the incurring of such debts and made in the six months preceding the insolvency declaration. (iii) The following transactions are exempt from claw-back actions: I. a payment for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with market practice; II. a remittance on a bank account, provided that it does not reduce the bankrupt entity’s debt towards the bank in a material and lasting manner; III. a sale, including an agreement for sale registered pursuant to Article 2645-bis of the Italian Civil Code, currently in force, made for a fair value and concerning a residential property that is intended as the main residence of the purchaser or the purchaser’s family (within three degrees of kinship) or a non-residential property that is intended as the main seat of the enterprise of the purchaser, on the condition that, as at the date of the purchase, such activity is actually exercised or the investments for the start of such activity have been carried out; IV. transactions entered into, payments made and security interests granted with respect to the bankrupt entity’s goods, provided that they are included in the implementation of a piano di _risanamento attestato (see Out-of-court Reorganization Plans (Piani di risanamento) pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law);_ V. a transaction entered into, payment made or security interest granted to implement a _concordato preventivo (see_ _Court-Supervised Pre-bankruptcy Composition with Creditors (concordato preventivo)) or an accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti under Article 182-bis of_ the Italian Bankruptcy Law (see _Debt Restructuring Agreements with Creditors (accordi di _ristrutturazione dei debiti) pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law) and_ transactions entered into, payments made and security interests granted after the filing of the application for a concordato preventivo (see above); VI. remuneration payments to the bankrupt entity’s employees and consultants; and VII. a payment of a debt that is immediately due, payable and made on the due date, with respect to services necessary for access to concordato preventivo procedures. Any security interest purported to be created over future assets and claims (including shares or quotas newly issued in the context of a non-gratuitous capital increase) will, in most circumstances, be deemed to be created at the time such future assets and claims come into existence, always subject to the relevant perfection formalities being duly complied with in accordance with applicable laws. Therefore, should the 244 ----- relevant grantor become subject to insolvency proceedings, assets and claims which come into existence after the commencement of such insolvency proceedings would be deemed part of the grantor’s insolvency estate available to its creditors generally. _Extraordinary Administration for Large Insolvent Companies (amministrazione straordinaria delle grandi imprese in stato di insolvenza)_ An extraordinary administration procedure applies under Italian law for large industrial and commercial enterprises (the ‘‘Prodi-bis procedure’’ set out under Legislative Decree no. 270 of 8 July 1999). The relevant company must be insolvent, but demonstrating serious recovery prospects. The purpose of the administration is to save and rehabilitate a company in financial distress due to its significant technical, commercial, productive and employment value. To qualify for this procedure, the company must have employed at least 200 employees in the previous year. In addition, it must have debts equal to at least two-thirds of its assets (attivo patrimoniale) as shown in its latest financial statements and two-thirds of its income from sales and services during its last financial year. Either of the creditors, the debtor, a court or the public prosecutor may make a petition to commence an extraordinary administration procedure. The same rules set forth for bankruptcy proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to extraordinary administration proceedings. There are two main phases — a judicial phase and an administrative phase. _Judicial Phase_ In the judicial phase, the court determines whether the company meets the admission criteria and whether it is insolvent. It then issues a decision to that effect and, along with an evaluation as to whether the company has serious prospects for recovery via a business sale or reorganization, appoints one or three judicial commissioners (commissiario giudiziale). The judicial receiver files a report with the court within 30 days, along with an evaluation as to, and within ten days from such filing, the Italian Productive Activities Minister (the ‘‘Ministry’’) makes an opinion on the admission of the company to the extraordinary administration procedure. The court then decides (within 30 days from the filing of the report) whether to admit the company to the procedure or to declare it bankruptcy. _Administrative Phase_ Assuming that the company is admitted to the extraordinary administration procedure, the administrative phase begins and an extraordinary commissioner (or three commissioners) is appointed by the Ministry. The extraordinary commissioner prepares a plan which can provide for either the sale of the business as a going concern within one year (unless extended by the Ministry) (the ‘‘Disposal Plan’’) or a reorganization leading to the company’s economic and financial recovery within two years (unless extended by the Ministry) (the ‘‘Recovery Plan’’). The plan may also include an arrangement with creditors (e.g., a debt for equity swap, an issue of shares in a new company to whom the assets of the company have been transferred, etc.) (concordato). The plan must be approved by the Ministry within 30 days from submission by the extraordinary commissioner. The procedure ends upon successful completion of either a Disposal Plan or a Recovery Plan, failing which the company is declared bankrupt. _Industrial Restructuring of Large Insolvent Companies (ristrutturazione industriale di grandi imprese in stato di insolvenza)_ Introduced in 2003, the industrial restructuring of large insolvent companies is also known as the ‘‘Marzano procedure’’ set out under Legislative Decree no. 347 of 27 December 2003. It is complementary to the Prodi-bis procedure and, except as otherwise provided, the same provisions apply. The Marzano procedure is intended to be faster than the Prodi-bis procedure. For example, although a company must be insolvent, the application to the Ministry is made together with the filing to the court for the declaration of the insolvency of the debtor. The purpose of this extraordinary administration is to continue the company’s operations, while restructuring its debts and selling non-core or non-strategic assets. The Marzano procedure only applies to large insolvent companies which, on a consolidated basis, have had at least 500 employees during the 12 months period before the procedure is commenced and have at least c300 million of debt. The decision whether to open a Marzano procedure is taken by the Ministry following the debtor’s request (who must also file with the court an application for the declaration of 245 ----- insolvency). The Ministry assesses whether the relevant requirements are met and then appoints the extraordinary commissioner who will manage the company. The court also decides on the company’s insolvency. The extraordinary commissioner has 180 days (or 270 days if the Ministry so agrees) to submit a Disposal Plan or Recovery Plan. The restructuring through the Disposal Plan or the Recovery Plan must be completed within two years (extendable to three years). If the Disposal or Recovery Plan is not approved by the Ministry, the court will declare the company bankrupt and open a bankruptcy proceeding. In 2008, the Italian government enacted an amendment to Law No. 39 of 2004. The reform introduced certain specific provisions applying to large companies carrying out services considered essential to the public. _Compulsory Administrative Winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa)_ A compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa) is only available for certain companies, including, _inter alia, public interest entities such as state-controlled companies, insurance companies, credit institutions and other financial institutions, none of which can be made subject to bankruptcy proceeding (fallimento). It is irrelevant whether these companies belong to the public or the private sector. The procedure may be triggered not only by the insolvency of the relevant entity, but also on other grounds expressly provided for by the relevant legal provisions (e.g., in respect of Italian banks, serious irregularities concerning the management of the bank or serious violations of the applicable legal, administrative or statutory provisions). The effect of this procedure is that the entity loses control over its assets and a liquidator (commissario _liquidatore) is appointed to wind up the company. The liquidator’s actions are monitored by a steering_ committee (comitato di sorveglianza). The powers, assigned to the designated judge and the bankruptcy court under the other insolvency proceedings, under this procedure are assumed by the relevant administrative authority. The effect on creditors of the forced administrative winding-up is largely the same as under bankruptcy proceedings and includes, for example, an automatic stay of enforcement proceedings. The same rules set forth for bankruptcy proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to compulsory administrative winding-up.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475
887,Offerings 2014.md,256,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE COLLATERAL AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,256.4,Italy,256.4.2,,"The following is a summary of certain limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Additional Notes, the agreements ancillary thereto and the security interests being provided for the Notes, and a summary of certain Italian insolvency law considerations. The description below is only a summary, and does not purport to be complete or exhaustive, or to discuss all of the limitations or considerations that may affect the validity and enforceability of the Additional Notes, the agreements ancillary thereto or the Collateral. Prospective investors in the Additional Notes should consult their own legal advisors with respect to such limitations and considerations. The Space Bidco is incorporated and organized under the laws of Italy, a Member State of the European Union. Pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000 of May 29, 2000 on insolvency proceedings (the ‘‘EU Insolvency Regulation’’), the court which shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the Member State (other than Denmark) where the company concerned has its ‘‘center of main interests’’ (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation). The determination of where any such company has its ‘‘center of main interests’’ is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and conflicting views. To date, no final decisions have been made in cases that have been brought before the European Court of Justice in relation to questions of interpretation of the effects of the E.U. Insolvency Regulation throughout the European Union. The term ‘‘center of main interests’’ is not a static concept. Although there is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that any such company has its ‘‘center of main interests’’ in the Member State in which it has its registered office, Preamble 13 of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the ‘‘center of main interests’’ of a debtor should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and is therefore ascertainable by third parties. In that respect, factors such as where board meetings are held, the location where the company conducts the majority of its business and the perception of the company’s creditors as regards the center of the company’s business operations may all be relevant in the determination of the place where the company has its ‘‘center of main interests’’. If the ‘‘center of main interests’’ of a company is and will remain located in the state in which it has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and, accordingly, a court in such jurisdiction would be 236 ----- entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be opened in another Member State. If the ‘‘center of main interests’’ of a debtor is in one Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open ‘‘territorial proceedings’’ only in the event that such debtor has an ‘‘establishment’’ (in the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member State. The effects of those territorial proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State. If the company does not have an establishment in any other Member State, no court of any other Member State has jurisdiction to open territorial proceedings in respect of such company under the EU Insolvency Regulation. To the extent that the ‘‘center of main interests’’ (as defined in the EU Insolvency Regulation described above) of The Space is located in Italy in the event of the insolvency or financial distress of such entities, insolvency, reorganization and debt restructuring proceedings will be initiated in Italy. Where main proceedings have been opened in the Member State in which the company has its center of main interests, any proceedings opened subsequently in another Member State in which the company has an establishment (secondary proceedings) are limited to ‘‘winding up proceedings’’ listed in Annex B of the E.U. Insolvency Regulation. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the company has its center of main interests have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can only be opened in another Member State where the company has an establishment if either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the Member State in which the company’s center of main interests is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of a creditor which is domiciled, habitually resident or has its registered office in the other Member State or whose claim arises from the operation of the establishment. The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must give to the judgment of the court of the main proceedings the same effect in all Member States so long as no secondary proceedings have been opened there. The liquidator appointed by a court in a Member State which has jurisdiction to open main proceedings (because the company’s center of main interests is there) may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets of the company from that other Member State) subject to certain limitations so long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in that other Member State or any preservation measure has not been taken to the contrary following a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the company has assets.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

In the event that the limitations on the guarantee issued by an Italian guarantor apply and/or there are payment obligations under any Notes other than in respect of principal or interest, the noteholders could have a reduced claim against the relevant guarantor. According to Italian law, the enforcement of any claims, obligations, security interest and rights in general may be subject to, inter alia, the following aspects: - the enforcement of obligations may be limited by insolvency proceedings listed above relating to or affecting the rights of creditors; - an Italian court will not necessarily grant any specific enforcement or precautionary measures, the availability of which is subject to the discretion of the court; - in contracts providing for mutual obligations (contratti a prestazioni corrispettive), each party can refuse to perform its obligation if the other party does not perform or does not offer to perform its own obligation thereunder, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of Article 1460 of the Italian Civil Code; - claims arising under Italian law governed documents may become barred under the provision of Italian law concerning prescriptions and limitations by the lapse of time (prescrizioni and decadenze) or may be or become subject to a claim and/or defense of set-off (compensazione) or to counterclaim; - pursuant to Article 1241 of the Italian Civil Code concerning set-off of reciprocal obligations (compensazione), persons who have reciprocal debt obligations may set-off such obligations for the correspondent amount when both such debt obligations have as an object a pecuniary obligation or fungible assets and are equally liquid and payable; 246 ----- - where any party to any agreement or instrument is vested with discretion or may determine a matter in its opinion, Italian law may require that such discretion is exercised reasonably or that such opinion is based on reasonable grounds; - the enforceability in Italy of obligations or contractual provisions governed by a foreign law may be limited by the fact that the relevant provisions of laws may be deemed contrary to Italian public policy principles; - there is some possibility that an Italian court could hold that a judgment on a particular agreement or instrument, whether given in an Italian court or elsewhere, would supersede such agreement or instrument to all intents and purposes, so that any obligation thereunder which by its terms would survive such judgment might not be held to do so; - enforcement of obligations may be invalidated by reason of fraud or abuse of the law (abuso del _diritto);_ - the enforceability of an obligation pursuant to the terms set forth in any agreement or instrument may be subject to the interpretation of an Italian court which may carry out such interpretation pursuant to the provisions of Articles 1362 and following of the Italian Civil Code; - any question as to whether or not any provision of any agreement or instrument which is illegal, invalid, not binding, unenforceable or void may be severed from the other provisions thereof in order to save those other provisions would be determined by an Italian court on the basis of the interpretation of the intention of the parties, taking also into account the conduct of the parties following the execution of such agreement or instrument (Article 1419 of the Italian Civil Code); - an Italian company, either directly or indirectly, cannot grant loans or provide security interest for the purchase or subscription of its own shares unless, in respect of a joint stock company (societ`a per azioni), the strict requirements provided for by the Italian Civil Code are satisfied; - an Italian company must have a specific corporate interest in guaranteeing or securing financial obligations of its parent company or any other companies, whether related or unrelated, such interest being determined by the relevant company on a case-by-case basis; - in case of bankruptcy, a receiver in bankruptcy is appointed by the court to administer the proceeding under the supervision of the bankruptcy court and creditors cannot start or continue individual foreclosure actions (including the enforcement of security interests) against the debtor (automatic stay). Furthermore, the sale of the relevant pledged assets is carried out by such receiver unless the pledgee is expressly authorized by the bankruptcy court; - the start or carrying on of individual foreclosure actions (including the enforcement of security interests) against the debtor would be prevented also if the debtor files a petition for the court’s ratification of the debt restructuring agreement under Article 182 bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or for being admitted to the procedure of court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo); - the priority rights (prelazione) granted by way of a pledge extend to interest accrued in the year in which the date of the relevant seizure/attachment or adjudication in bankruptcy falls (or, in the absence of seizure/attachment, at the date of the notification of the payment demand (precetto)) and extend, moreover, to interest accrued and to accrue thereafter, but only to the extent of legal interest and until the date of the forced sale in the context of the relevant foreclosure proceeding/bankruptcy proceedings; - the tax authorities may require payment of taxes from the party liable at law (either severally or jointly with other parties) to make such payment, regardless of any provisions in any agreement or instrument requiring a party to pay or indemnify another person against payment of such taxes; - there could be circumstances in which Italian law would not give effect to provisions concerning advance waivers or forfeitures; - the effectiveness of terms exculpating a party from liability or duties otherwise owed is prevented by Italian law in the event of gross negligence (colpa grave), wilful misconduct (dolo) or the violation of mandatory provisions; - penalties and liquidated damages (penali) may be equitably reduced by a court; 247 ----- - Italian courts do not necessarily give full effect to an indemnity for the costs of enforcement or litigation; - a security interest does not prevent creditors of the relevant debtor other than the pledgee from continuing enforcement or enforcement proceedings on the assets secured by the relevant pledge; and - in case of bankruptcy of the grantor of the pledge over quotas or shares, the assets secured by the pledge could be freely sold to any third party in the context of the relevant bankruptcy proceeding and, as a consequence, the proceeds would be set aside for the prior satisfaction of the pledgee but the pledge would be terminated and, therefore, the latter would lose entitlement to the voting rights on the pledged quotas/shares.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

The avoidance may relate to, inter alia (i) transactions made by the debtor within a Suspect Period of one year prior to the declaration of the insolvency at below market value (i.e., to the extent the asset or obligation given or undertaken exceeds by one-quarter the value of the consideration received by the debtor), or involving unusual means of payment (e.g., payment in kind) or security interests granted after the relevant secured obligations have arisen but before the secured obligation became due and payable, whereby the creditor must prove its lack of knowledge of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity in order to rebut any claw-back action, (ii) security interests granted in order to secure a debt due and payable, whereby the creditor must prove its lack of knowledge of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity in order to rebut any claw-back action during the suspect period of six months prior to the 249 ----- declaration of the insolvency, and (iii) payments of due and payable obligations, transactions at arm’s length or security interests granted simultaneously to the creation of the secured obligations during the suspect period of six months prior to the declaration of the insolvency, whereby the bankruptcy receiver must prove that the creditor was aware of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity in order to enforce any claw-back action. For a more detailed explanation of the terms, conditions and consequences of claw-back actions in an insolvency scenario, see ‘‘ — Insolvency Laws’’. If challenged successfully, the security interest may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, holders of the Additional Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related security documents. In addition under Italian law, in certain circumstances also in the ordinary course of business, an action can be brought by any creditor of a given debtor within five years from the date in which the latter enters into a guarantee, security, agreement and any other act by which it disposes of any of its assets, in order to seek a claw-back action (azione revocatoria ordinaria) pursuant to Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code (which results in a declaration of ineffectiveness as to the acting creditor) of the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act that is purported to be prejudicial to the acting creditor’s right of credit. An Italian court could revoke the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act only if it, in addition to the ascertainment of the prejudice, was to make the two following findings: - that the debtor was aware of the prejudice which the act would cause to the rights of the acting creditor, or, if such act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the act was fraudulently designed for the purpose of prejudicing the satisfaction of the claim or credit; and - that, in the case of non-gratuitous act, the third party involved was aware of said prejudice and, if the act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the said third party participated in the fraudulent design.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

If a security interest or a guarantee is being provided in the context of an acquisition, group reorganization, refinancing or restructuring, financial assistance issues may also be triggered. _Corporate Benefit_ An Italian company entering into a transaction (including granting a security interest) must receive a real and adequate benefit in exchange for it. The concept of a real and adequate benefit is not specifically defined in the applicable legislation and is determined by a factual analysis on a case-by-case basis. As a general rule, corporate benefit is to be assessed at the level of the relevant company on a stand-alone basis, although upon certain circumstances and subject to specific rules the interest of the group to which such company belongs may also be taken into consideration. As a general rule, absence of a real and adequate corporate benefit could render the transaction ultra _vires and potentially affected by conflict of interest and the related corporate resolutions adopted by the_ shareholders and directors may be the subject matter of challenges and annulment. Civil liabilities also may be imposed on the directors of the company if it is assessed that they did not act in the interest of it and that the acts they carried out do not fall within the corporate purpose of the company or were against mandatory provisions of Italian law. The lack of corporate benefit could also lead to civil liabilities on those companies or persons ultimately exercising control over the company or having knowingly received an advantage or profit from such improper control. Moreover, the transaction (including the security interest granted by an Italian company) could be declared null and void if the lack of corporate benefit was (or ought to be) known by the third party and such third party acted intentionally against the interest of the company. In relation to security interests, while corporate benefit for a downstream security (i.e., a security granted to secure financial obligations of direct or indirect subsidiaries of the relevant grantor) can usually be easily proved, the validity and effectiveness of an upstream or cross-stream security (i.e., a security granted to secure financial obligations of the direct or indirect parent or sister companies of the relevant grantor) granted by an 250 ----- entity organized under the laws of Italy depend on the capacity to prove the existence of a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the granted security interest. The general rule is that the risk assumed by an Italian grantor of security must not be disproportionate to the direct or indirect economic benefit to it. To this extent, customary limitation language is usually inserted in indentures, credit agreements and guarantees for the purpose of limiting the amount guaranteed by the guarantor to an amount that is proportionate to the direct or indirect economic benefit that the guarantor derives from a transaction. Pursuant to paragraph 3 of Article 2391 of the Italian civil code, if the resolution taken by the board of directors of a joint stock company (societ`a per azioni) approving a transaction has been taken with the decisive vote of a director having either a personal or third party’s interest in such transaction or such interest has not been disclosed to the other directors and the statutory auditors of the company or the resolution does not provide an appropriate explanation of the reasons that justify such transaction and the corporate benefit deriving therefrom in favor of the company, and provided that such resolution can cause a damage to the company, the resolution may be challenged by the directors and statutory auditors of the company within 90 days from its date of approval. The resolution may be challenged also by the shareholders of the company, if it is prejudicial to their rights (article 2388, paragraph 4, of the Italian Civil Code). The directors and statutory auditors that have been previously informed of the aforementioned interest and have expressed a favorable vote may not challenge the resolution. The challenging of the resolution does not affect the rights acquired by third parties in good faith on the basis of acts carried out in fulfilment of the resolution. Pursuant to paragraph 1 of article 2475-ter of the Italian civil code, if the sole director of a limited liability company (societ`a a responsabilit`a limitata), at the time on which it enters into an agreement, has an interest conflicting with that of the company, that company may ask that the relevant agreement be voided (annullato), if such conflict of interest was (or ought to be) known by the other parties to such agreement. _Financial Assistance_ Save for specific exceptions, provided in respect of joint stock companies (societ`a per azioni), it is unlawful under Italian laws for a company to give financial assistance — within the meaning of article 2358 and article 2474 (as the case may be) of the Italian Civil Code — (whether by means of loans, security, guarantees or otherwise) to support the acquisition or subscription of its own shares or quotas or those of any entity that (directly or indirectly) controls the Italian company, and any loan, guarantee or security given or granted in breach of these provisions is null and void. Financial assistance to refinance indebtedness incurred by a company to purchase or subscribe for its own shares or quotas or those of its direct or indirect parent company or to secure any such indebtedness upon or after a merger pursuant to Article 2501-bis might also be considered as falling within the scope of Italian financial assistance provisions. _Article 1938 of Italian Civil Code_ Finally, also pursuant and for the purposes of article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, a guarantee granted by an Italian company shall have to be limited as to a maximum amount (fideiussione). Such maximum amount should be expressly identified at the outset and expressed in figures (either in the guarantee deed or by reference to a separate document, such as the Indenture). It has been held that such determination must be proportionate to the relevant guarantor’s assets. If such determination is deemed disproportional to each relevant Guarantor’s assets, there is the risk that the guarantee could be declared void. In this respect, in relation to the guarantee under the Indenture, an additional limitation language has been provided pursuant to article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code and in order not to cause any breach of the Italian provisions on financial assistance (including, but not limited to, the provisions of article 2358 and/or article 2474, as the case may be, of the Italian Civil Code). According to such limitation language, the maximum amount that the Italian guarantor may be required to pay in respect of its obligations as guarantor under the Indenture shall be determined on the basis of a formula according to which such maximum amount will not exceed the amounts from time to time outstanding under the Indenture which have been used for purposes other than the acquisition or subscription of shares of such Italian guarantor or its (direct or indirect) controlling entities. In addition, any guarantee granted by an Italian guarantor for the obligations under the Indenture of any other Debtor (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) which is not a Subsidiary of the Italian guarantor shall, in any case and at any time, be limited to a ratio whereby the numerator is the aggregate outstanding amount under the Indenture at such time and the denominator is the aggregate of any amount outstanding 251 ----- under all Secured Debt Documents (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) which have the benefit of a guarantee of the Italian guarantor at such time, multiplied by the lower of: (i) the net worth (patrimonio netto) of the Italian guarantor, as resulting from its latest approved financial statements, less the minimum capital pursuant to article 2463 of the Italian Civil Code (capitale minimo); or (ii) the principal amount borrowed by such other Debtor (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) under the Indenture, to the extent directly or indirectly on-lent to the Italian guarantor.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

In determining the aggregate amount of bonds issued by a company, one must take into account also the aggregate amount of guarantees issued by the company in respect of bonds issued by other companies, including foreign companies. Should the Additional Notes be destined to be subscribed by entities which are not professional investors subject to prudential supervision (investitori professionali soggetti a vigilanza prudenziale a norma delle leggi speciali), the aforementioned limit would apply in respect of the guarantee obligations expressed to be assumed by the Italian guarantors and, should the amount of the guarantee obligations exceed the aforementioned limit, such obligations may be declared null and void. It is further disputed whether Article 2412 applies also to Italian limited liability companies (societ`a a responsabilit`a limitata). Pursuant to Article 5 of Italian Legislative Decree No. 28 of 4 March 2010 as amended by Law Decree No. 69 of 21 June 2013 (converted in law by Law 9 August 2013, No. 98) (the ‘‘Mediation Decree’’), applicable to judicial proceedings started after the 20 September 2013, before bringing a judicial action in Italy covered by (and not exempted from) the Mediation Decree and relating to a dispute on civil and commercial matters, including banking and financial contracts (contratti bancari e finanziari), in front of an Italian court, the claimant must attempt to settle the relevant dispute through a mediation process in accordance with the provisions set out in the Mediation Decree. If the dispute does not fall under one of the categories excluded from the application of the Mediation Decree (such as, inter alia, injunctions proceedings (procedimenti per ingiunzione) and precautionary measures (provvedimenti urgenti e cautelari)), the preliminary attempt of the mediation qualifies a condition to the commencement of the judicial action (condizione di procedibilit`a dell’azione). _Italian Usury Laws_ If at any time an Italian entity would be liable for the payment of remuneration of principal (including the rate of interest, default interest, fees, charges, expenses and other costs, but excluding tax costs) resulting in a breach of Italian law on usury (Law No. 108 of March 7, 1996) and any related implementing regulations, then the obligations of such entity in respect of the remuneration of principal shall be limited to the payment of remuneration of principal which is permitted under Italian law on usury and any related implementing regulations. Indeed, Article 1815 of the Italian Civil Code provides that if the remuneration exceeds the maximum rates permitted under the Italian law on usury, no remuneration is due to the creditor. _Equitable Subordination of the Funding Loans_ Italian corporate law (Articles 2497-quinquies and 2467 of the Italian Civil Code) provides for rules to protect creditors against ‘‘undercapitalized companies’’ and provide for remedies in respect thereof. In this respect in case of a loan to a company by, respectively, (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, direct the company or exercises management and coordination powers over that borrowing company or (ii) a quotaholder in the case of a company incorporated in Italy as a _societ`a a responsabilit`a limitata, will be subordinated to all other creditors of that borrower and senior only to the equity in that borrower, if the loan is made when, also taking into account the kind of business of the borrower, there was an excessive imbalance of the borrower’s indebtedness as compared to its net assets, or the borrower was already in a financial situation requiring an injection of equity and not a loan (undercapitalization). Any payment made by the borrower with respect to any such loan within one year prior to its bankruptcy declaration would be required to be returned to the borrower. 252 ----- As of the date hereof, there are few court precedents on the applicability of the foregoing provisions and limited guidance has been provided to date by the Italian courts on the features and extent of the undercapitalization requirement. Such precedents tend however to provide a broad interpretation of such provisions, affirming, inter alia, that Article 2467 does indeed apply, based on an interpretation by analogy, also to companies incorporated as joint stock company (societ`a per azioni) (and not only limited liability companies (societ`a a responsabilit`a limitata)), and to indirect form of financings, such as guarantees or finance granted by parties related to the quota holders of the relevant company.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

Due to the impossibility to clearly identify and keep track over time of the names of the individual holder of the Notes, Italian security documents are created in favour of the Security Agent as representative of all secured creditors. It is uncertain and untested in the Italian courts whether under Italian law a security can be created and perfected (i) in favor of creditors (such as the Noteholders) which are neither directly parties to the relevant security documents nor are specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries; and (ii) in favor of the Trustee of holders of the Notes since there is no established concept of ‘‘trust’’ or ‘‘trustee’’ under Italian law and the precise nature, effect and enforceability of the duties, rights and powers of the Trustee as agent or trustee for holders of the Notes under security interests on Italian assets is debatable under Italian law. Therefore, there might be risks regarding the enforceability of the security interests created by the Collateral. Moreover, Parallel Debt structures, according to which the security interests is also granted in favour of the Security Agent, as beneficiary of parallel debt obligations against the Issuer, which will be discharged to the extent the corresponding principal payment obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture and the Notes are discharged, have not been tested under Italian law and there can be no assurance that they will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability posed by Italian law. If any challenge to the validity of the security interests or any implemented Parallel Debt structure was successful, the holders of the Notes may not be able to recover any amounts under the security interests. _Insolvency claw-back_ Similarly to other jurisdictions, Italian Bankruptcy Law sets forth certain ‘‘claw-back’’ or avoidance provisions in case of insolvency that may give rise, inter alia, to the revocation of payments made, transactions incurred or security interests granted before the commencement of an insolvency procedure. The key avoidance provisions target transactions made below market value, or with a view to defraud creditors or to advantage one creditor over the others. Bankruptcy claw-back rules under Italian law are normally considered to be favorable to the receiver compared to the rules applicable in other jurisdictions, which you may be familiar with. In particular, the Italian Bankruptcy Law distinguishes between acts or transactions which are ineffective by operation of law and acts or transactions which are voidable at the request of the bankruptcy receiver/ court commissioner. Transactions carried out for no consideration within two years prior to the commencement of the bankruptcy proceeding are ineffective vis-`a-vis the company’s creditors. The following acts and transactions, if made by the insolvent debtor during the relevant period of time as specified below, may be avoided and declared ineffective, unless the other party proves that it had no actual or constructive knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency: - transactions entered into in the year before the insolvency declaration, when the value of the debt or the obligations undertaken by the bankrupt entity exceeds 25% of the value of the consideration received by and/or promised to the debtor; - payments of debts, due and payable, made by the bankrupt entity not in cash or by other customary means of payment in the year before the insolvency declaration; - pledges and voluntary mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the year before the insolvency declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which have not yet fallen due; and 248 ----- - pledges and judicial and/or voluntary mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the six months before the insolvency declaration in order to secure matured debts. The following acts and transactions, if made by the insolvent during the vulnerability period or such other period specified below, may be avoided and declared ineffective if the bankruptcy receiver proves (also by way of presumptions) that the other party knew that the bankrupt entity was insolvent: - the payments of debts that are immediately due and payable and any onerous transactions entered into or made within six months before the insolvency declaration; and - deeds granting pre-emptive rights in favor of debts (even those of third parties) which are simultaneously created and made within six months before the insolvency declaration. The following transactions by the insolvent debtor are exempt from claw-back actions in case of subsequent bankruptcy of the same: - payments for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business according to market practice; a remittance on a bank account, provided that it does not materially and permanently reduce the bankrupt entity’s debt towards the bank; - the sale, including an agreement for sale registered pursuant to Article 2645-bis of the Italian Civil Code, currently in force, made for a fair value and concerning a residential property that is intended as the main residence of the purchaser or the purchaser’s family (within three degrees of kinship) or a non-residential property that is intended as the main place of business of the purchaser and the purchaser has already commenced its business activity in the relevant premises or made investments to that end, as of the date of which the bankruptcy is declared; - transactions entered into, payments made and guarantees issued by the insolvent debtor pursuant to a certified restructuring plan duly certified by an independent expert; - transactions entered into, payments made, guarantee issued or security granted by the insolvent debtor to implement a ratified debt restructuring agreement or court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors; - remuneration payments to the debtor’s employees for working activities carried out by same; and - payments in due course of due and payable debts incurred for services which were necessary for the company to access to a restructuring procedure. In addition, the bankruptcy receiver can request that certain transactions of the debtor be declared void within the Italian Civil Code ordinary claw-back period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria). Under Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, a creditor may demand that transactions whereby the bankrupt entity disposed of its assets prejudicially to such creditor’s rights be declared ineffective with respect to such creditor, provided that the bankrupt entity was aware of such prejudice (or, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, that such transaction was fraudulently entered into by the bankruptcy entity for the purpose of prejudicing the bankrupt entity) and that, in the case of a transaction entered into for consideration with a third person, the third person was also aware of such prejudice (and, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, such third person participated in the fraudulent design).

Consequently, in the event of an insolvency of any such Guarantors, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Jersey. There are two principal regimes for corporate insolvency in Jersey: _d´esastre and winding-up (including summary winding-up, just and equitable winding-up and creditors’ winding-up). The principal type of insolvency procedure available to creditors under Jersey law is the application for an Act of the Royal Court of Jersey under the Bankruptcy (D´esastre) (Jersey) Law 1990, as amended (the ‘‘Jersey Bankruptcy Law’’) declaring the property of a debtor to be ‘‘en d´esastre’’ (a ‘‘declaration’’). On a declaration of _d´esastre, title and possession of the property of the debtor vest automatically in the Viscount, an official of_ the Royal Court (the ‘‘Viscount’’). With effect from the date of declaration, a creditor has no other remedy against the property or person of the debtor, and may not commence or continue any legal proceedings to recover the debt (except with the consent of the Viscount or the Royal Court). Additionally, the shareholders of a Jersey company (but not its creditors) can instigate a winding-up of an insolvent company, which is known as a ‘‘creditors’ winding-up’’ pursuant to Chapter 4 of Part 21 of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, as amended (the ‘‘Jersey Companies Law’’). On a creditors’ winding-up, a liquidator is appointed, usually by the creditors. The liquidator will stand in the shoes of the directors and administer the winding up, gather assets, make appropriate disposals of assets, settle claims and distribute assets as appropriate. After the commencement of the creditors’ winding-up, no action can be taken or continued against the company except with the leave of the Royal Court. The corporate state and capacity of the company continues until the end of the winding-up procedure, when the company is dissolved. The Jersey Companies Law requires a creditor of a company (subject to appeal) to be bound by an arrangement entered into by the company and its creditors immediately before or in the course of its winding-up if (inter alia) three-quarters in number and value of the creditors acceded to the arrangement. Alternatively, a Jersey company as the debtor may be wound up by the Royal Court (under Article 155 of the Jersey Companies Law) if the debtor has not been declared en d´esastre and the Royal Court is of the opinion that it is just and equitable, or expedient in the public interest, to do so. This procedure is less common than the principal corporate insolvency procedures of a creditors’ winding-up or a d´esastre. The application to the Royal Court for such winding-up may be made by the debtor, a director, a shareholder, the Minister for Economic Development (the ‘‘Minister’’) or the Jersey Financial Services Commission (the ‘‘JFSC’’) on just and equitable grounds, or by the Minister or the JFSC on public interest grounds. The test to be applied by the Royal Court in considering the application is whether it holds the above opinion, as opposed to a test of solvency. If the Royal Court orders a debtor to be wound up, it may appoint a liquidator and direct the conduct of the winding-up in the court order.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

Accordingly, the Courts of Jersey may not recognize the powers of an administrator, administrative receiver or other receiver appointed in respect of Jersey situs assets. However, under Article 49(1) of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law, the Jersey Royal Court may assist the courts of prescribed countries and territories in all matters relating to the insolvency of any person to the extent that the Jersey court thinks fit. These prescribed jurisdictions include the United Kingdom. Further, in doing so, the Royal Court may have regard to the UNCITRAL model law, even though the model law has not been (and is unlikely to be) implemented as a separate law in Jersey. If the request comes from a prescribed country but not by a court-made request or from a non-prescribed country, then common law and principles of comity will be considered by the Royal Court by virtue of its inherent jurisdiction. If insolvency proceedings are afoot in another jurisdiction in relation to the company, the nature and extent of the cooperation from Jersey is likely to depend on the nature of the requesting country’s insolvency regime. If the requesting country adheres to principles of territoriality, as opposed to universality, and, for instance, ring-fences assets for local creditors, full cooperation is highly unlikely. If, however, the jurisdiction applies similar fundamental principles to those applied in Jersey, the Royal Court’s approach is more likely to be similar to the position where prescribed countries are involved. In the case of both statutory and non-statutory requests for assistance, it should not be assumed that the UNCITRAL provisions will automatically be followed. That is a matter for the discretion of the Royal Court. It would also be wrong to assume for European countries that the position will be in accordance with EU Insolvency Regulation. Jersey does not form part of the European Community for the purposes of implementation of its directions. Accordingly, the EU Insolvency Regulation does not apply as a matter of Jersey domestic law and the test of center of main interests does not automatically apply as a result (although the Courts of Jersey may have regard to the concept of center of main interests).",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

The Jersey SIAs for this transaction are governed by the Security Interests (Jersey) Law 1983 rather than the Security Interests (Jersey) Law 2012 because they were entered into in August 2013 before the Security Interests (Jersey) Law 2012 came into full force and effect on 2 January 2014. Therefore the paragraphs below describe the relevant statutory provisions under the Security Interests (Jersey) Law 1983 rather than under the Security Interests (Jersey) Law 2012. Enforcement of Jersey security may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, re-organization or other laws of general application relating to or affecting the rights of creditors, but insolvency or bankruptcy alone will not render the security interests created pursuant to Jersey security interest agreements invalid or non-binding on the parties thereto or any liquidator of a Jersey company or the Viscount in a d´esastre of a Jersey company’s property. This is subject to certain statutory exceptions, which include (but are not limited to): - Article 159(4) of the Jersey Companies Law provides that after the commencement of a creditors’ winding-up of a Jersey company no action shall be taken or proceeded with against the company except by leave of the Royal Court and subject to such terms as that court may impose; and - Article 10(1) of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law provides that with effect from the date of a declaration of _d´esastre against a person (the ‘‘bankrupt’’), a creditor shall not have any other remedy against the_ property or person of the bankrupt or commence or (except with the consent of the Viscount or by order of the Royal Court) continue any action or legal proceedings to recover such creditor’s debt. In relation to any Jersey law security interest agreements (the ‘‘Jersey SIAs’’), upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined in each of the Jersey SIAs), the secured party may exercise the power of sale over the collateral specified in the Jersey SIAs and apply the sale proceeds in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 of the Security Interests (Jersey) Law 1983. The Security Interests (Jersey) Law 1983 does not allow for the secured party to take title to such collateral absolutely or to transfer the collateral to itself in settlement of the secured obligations other than in relation to collateral that is money or represented by a negotiable 255 ----- instrument or moneys held in a bank account. Further, the Security Interests (Jersey) Law 1983 provides that such power of sale (including any appropriation of money, a negotiable instrument or moneys in a bank account) can only be exercised once the secured party has served notice on the debtor specifying the Event of Default and, where such default is capable of remedy, requiring the debtor to remedy it. In cases where the Event of Default is capable of remedy, the secured party cannot exercise the statutory power of sale until the expiry of a 14 day period following the service of such notice. - In relation to the Jersey SIAs, under Article 6(4) of the Security Interests (Jersey) Law 1983, on a _d´esastre of the property of a debtor, the Viscount may apply to the Royal Court of Jersey for an order_ vesting in him the rights of the secured party to the collateral subject to a security interest pursuant to the Security Interests (Jersey) Law 1983 (including the power of sale under such law) and directing that it be sold. The proceeds of sale, following deduction of the Viscount’s costs (in accordance with his usual practice), will be applied in meeting the secured obligations under any security interests existing in respect of such collateral, according to the priority set out in the Security Interests (Jersey) Law 1983. In our view, the Viscount is most likely to make such application to the Royal Court of Jersey if the secured party is acting in a way that the Viscount considers detrimental to the conduct of the d´esastre, for example, by the secured party being dilatory in exercising his power of sale under the Security Interests (Jersey) Law 1983. - In relation to the Jersey SIAs, on a d´esastre, the Viscount will automatically take title to the assets of the debtor, subject to any pre-existing rights in respect of such assets. This has the consequence that the Viscount may need to be involved to effect the exercise of the statutory power of sale of assets secured by way of possession pursuant to Article 2(3) of the Security Interests (Jersey) Law 1983. Article 32(7) of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law provides that, where any property of a debtor is subject to a security interest created pursuant to the Security Interests (Jersey) Law 1983, the proceeds of sale are to be applied in the manner set out in Article 8(6) of that Law. Article 8(6) provides for the costs and expenses of the sale to be deducted first from the proceeds of such sale, following which the proceeds would be applied to satisfy those obligations secured under the Security Interests (Jersey) Law 1983 in order of priority according to date of creation. However, where the Viscount is required to be involved in the sale of the secured assets because he holds title following a d´esastre, the Viscount has, as a matter of practice, sought to claim his fees (which are currently approximately 10% of the value of realized assets and 2.5% of the value of distributed assets) from such proceeds of sale. In the enforcement of foreign security in Jersey, the Royal Court — properly applying the relevant provisions of foreign law — is likely to uphold (subject to the comments above) a claim that the relevant security interest (and other than in respect of any property or assets situated or deemed to be situated in Jersey) is binding on a Jersey company and any liquidator or other similar person having control of the assets of a Jersey company. A transfer of shares in a Jersey company, not being a transfer made to or with the sanction of the liquidator of the company in a creditors’ winding-up (insolvent winding-up) under the Jersey Companies Law, or the Viscount after the property of the company is declared to be en d´esastre under the Jersey Bankruptcy Law, and an alteration in the status of the company’s members made after the commencement of the creditors’ winding-up or after such declaration of en d´esastre, is void.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

If a Guarantor’s center of main interests is in Poland, then pursuant to the Polish Bankruptcy and Rehabilitation Law of February 28, 2003 (Dz.U. 2012.1112 as amended) (the ‘‘Polish Bankruptcy Law’’) and the EU Insolvency Regulation, the main bankruptcy proceedings of that Guarantor should be conducted before a Polish court. The EU Insolvency Regulation states that the place of the registered office is presumed to be the center of its main interests, in the absence of proof to the contrary. Consequently, in the event of the insolvency of a Polish Guarantor, bankruptcy proceedings would be governed by Polish law if its center of main interests is in Poland. Any judgment opening insolvency proceedings granted by a Polish court will be recognized in all other European Union member states (except for Denmark) from the time that judgment becomes effective in Poland. Recognition of these bankruptcy proceedings will not preclude the opening of secondary bankruptcy proceedings, as described in more detail above. 256 ----- According to the Polish Bankruptcy Law, the grounds for declaring bankruptcy of a debtor which is a commercial company are as follows: (1) it does not fulfill its due and payable pecuniary obligations (wymagalne zobowi˛azania pieni˛e˙zne), and/or (2) its obligations (zobowi˛azania) exceed the total value of its assets (maj˛atek), even if it discharges those obligations on a current basis. Each individual who has the right to represent the Polish Guarantor (whether alone or with others) is obliged to file a motion to declare the Polish Guarantor bankrupt within two weeks from the day the grounds listed above for declaring bankruptcy are met. In practice, it is difficult to determine the day from which the two week time limit for filing the motion should be counted. Additionally, each of the Polish Guarantor’s creditors may file for bankruptcy of the relevant Polish Guarantor. There are two types of bankruptcy proceedings under Polish law: ‘‘liquidation’’ bankruptcy, the principal aim of which is to satisfy creditors from the proceeds obtained from the sale of the debtor’s assets (such bankruptcy would result in dissolution of the debtor’s company, unless otherwise permitted by law); and ‘‘arrangement’’ bankruptcy, which are essentially aimed at satisfying creditors through a settlement approved by the required majority of creditors and the court (such bankruptcy could allow the debtor to continue its business activity following the completion of these proceedings). _Liquidation bankruptcy_ In the event of liquidation bankruptcy, the court appoints a bankruptcy receiver (syndyk) who takes over the management of the bankrupt’s assets. From this moment on, the receiver administers the bankrupt entity’s assets and represents the bankrupt entity. The bankrupt entity’s assets become bankruptcy assets which will be liquidated to pay off creditors. The bankruptcy receiver prepares a list of the assets. On the declaration of bankruptcy, all of the debtor’s debts become due and payable. Interest may be paid from the bankruptcy estate only for the period up to the date of the declaration of bankruptcy, unless the respective receivables are secured by mortgages, pledges, registered pledges, treasury pledges and/or maritime pledges, and satisfied from the security assets’ proceeds. _Arrangement bankruptcy_ The arrangement bankruptcy proceedings are conducted with respect to the debtor, where it has been credibly established that the creditors’ claims will be satisfied in a greater extent than they would be in liquidation bankruptcy proceedings, unless, given the debtor’s behavior to date, it is uncertain whether the arrangement will be fulfilled, which will not be relevant if the arrangement proposals include a liquidation arrangement. In the event of arrangement bankruptcy proceedings, the court appoints a court supervisor (nadzorca _s˛adowy) or an administrator (zarz˛adca) instead of the bankruptcy receiver. A court supervisor is appointed in_ situations where the debtor will continue to manage its assets, whereas an administrator is appointed when the debtor is deprived of the right to manage its assets. If the required majority of creditors vote in favor of an arrangement, the arrangement is accepted and then approved by the court, unless the arrangement is contrary to the rules of law or it is obvious that it will not be performed. The court’s decision approving the arrangement may be appealed. The accepted arrangement is binding on (affects) all creditors whose receivables are covered by the arrangement in accordance with the provisions of the Polish Bankruptcy Law. Certain receivables are not covered (affected) by the arrangement. These include, inter alia: (1) receivables secured with mortgages, pledges, registered pledges, treasury pledges and/or maritime pledges (to the extent they can be satisfied from a security asset); a creditor whose claims are so secured may, however, consent to being subject to an arrangement; (2) receivables under derivative or repo transactions; and (3) receivables under employment contracts. 257 ----- The rules under which the bankrupt entity’s debts will be repaid are stipulated in the arrangement. The most common arrangement involves the debtors paying only a portion of the debts and/or deferral of payments of such debts, and the bankrupt entity continuing its operations. It is also possible, however, to accept a liquidation arrangement where a determination is made as to how the bankrupt entity’s assets and the business will be liquidated. The court may change the manner of conducting the bankruptcy proceedings from the arrangement bankruptcy proceedings into the liquidation proceedings and vice versa, if the grounds for conducting a given type of the proceedings become known after the declaration of bankruptcy. _Other bankruptcy-proceeding issues_ Once bankruptcy is declared (irrespective of its type), no mortgage, pledge, registered pledge, treasury pledge and/or maritime mortgage can be established over the bankrupt entity’s assets in order to secure a receivable debt which arose before the declaration of bankruptcy. This does not apply to a mortgage where a motion to enter a mortgage was filed with the court at least six months before the filing of the bankruptcy petition. Provisions of a contract which provide, in the event of a declaration of bankruptcy, for amendments to, or termination of, a legal relationship to which the bankrupt entity is a party, are invalid. A provision of a contract to which the bankrupt entity is a party which renders the achievement of the goal of the bankruptcy proceedings impossible or difficult is ineffective against the bankruptcy estate. If court proceedings against the bankrupt entity are pending on the day of the bankruptcy declaration in any common courts, then such proceedings are in some cases discontinued. If proceedings were pending in which the bankrupt entity was the plaintiff, the receiver or the administrator replaces the bankrupt entity. If a court supervisor is appointed, it would act together with the bankrupt entity in the proceedings. If enforcement proceedings regarding the receivables included in the arrangement by operation of law, in the case of arrangement bankruptcy, and any receivables which may be filed within the bankruptcy proceedings, in the case of liquidation bankruptcy, were pending against the bankrupt entity on the date of the bankruptcy declaration, they are suspended with effect from the date of the bankruptcy declaration and the proceeds received are transferred to the bankruptcy estate after the decision on the declaration of bankruptcy becomes final. All the arbitration clauses expire with effect from the date of the bankruptcy declaration and if arbitration proceedings were pending on the date of the bankruptcy declaration, such proceedings are discontinued. Creditors have a right to submit their claims within the time limit indicated in a decision declaring bankruptcy. Claims supported by evidence of claims are usually admitted, i.e., included in the list of liabilities. If a filed claim is not included in the list, then a creditor has a right to appeal. The procedural requirements for submitting a claim are very formalistic. Any debt (claim) payable in a currency other than złoty, regardless of whether the claim has fallen due or not, if put on the list of claims, will be expressed in złoty and the złoty equivalent is calculated on the basis of the average exchange rate of the National Bank of Poland prevailing on the date the bankruptcy court issues a decision on the debtor’s bankruptcy. Accordingly, in the event of bankruptcy, creditors (e.g. holders of the Additional Notes) may be subject to exchange rate risk between such date when the bankruptcy court issues a decision on the debtor’s bankruptcy and the date of receipt of any amounts in the course of bankruptcy liquidation. In the case of liquidation bankruptcy, creditors under the Guarantee will be satisfied from the proceeds obtained from the sale of a Polish Guarantor’s assets. When the repayment of receivables arising under the Guarantee becomes part of an arrangement in arrangement bankruptcy proceedings, there is a possibility that such receivables may be decreased on the basis of a decision of the creditors (such decisions would be subject to certain mandatory rules of the Polish Bankruptcy Law). The proceeds separated to satisfy a receivable whose repayment depends on a condition precedent will be handed over to the creditor if the creditor can prove that the condition has been fulfilled; otherwise this amount will be deposited with the court. The proceeds separated to satisfy a receivable which is not yet due and payable shall be deposited with the court. As a rule, creditors’ receivables towards a Polish Guarantor will be divided into five categories and creditors having their receivables in a lower ranking category may not obtain satisfaction before all receivables 258 ----- in the higher ranking category have been fully satisfied. Any unsecured debt under bonds or credit falls into category four; however any unpaid interest under such bonds or credit are included in that category only for a period of one year before the bankruptcy declaration and for any previous period they fall into category five. The first three categories, which rank ahead of category four, concern, inter alia, the following receivables: (1) the costs of bankruptcy proceedings; (2) payments due under employment contracts for the period before the date of the declaration of bankruptcy; and (3) payments to the state, such as taxes and social security obligations for employees. Within each category, each receivable is satisfied pro rata to the total value of receivables listed in such category. If an asset owned by the bankrupt entity (i.e., a Polish Guarantor) is subject to a mortgage, pledge, registry pledge, treasury pledge or a maritime mortgage, then a creditor in whose favor the security has been established has a right to receive proceeds from the sale of that asset before the other creditors (with a few exceptions relating to mortgages and maritime mortgages such as, for instance, a certain portion of alimony claims or employee salaries). Where a number of mortgages have been established on a real estate which considerably exceed its value, creditors are repaid from such real estate according to their priority set out in the land and mortgage register maintained for that real estate. It is not clear whether Polish courts, an administrator (zarz˛adca), court supervisor (nadzorca s˛adowy) or a bankruptcy receiver (syndyk) (unless otherwise specifically stated, hereinafter the term ‘‘administrator’’ shall include each one of zarz˛adca, nadzorca s˛adowy or syndyk) will give effect to provisions on subordination in intercreditor agreements. There is a risk that in the course of insolvency proceedings claims of all unsecured creditors will be discharged on a _pari passu basis, irrespectively of any provisions on subordination in intercreditor agreements, and the creditors who are the parties to such agreements may have to enforce their rights thereunder only outside of the insolvency proceedings (e.g. by claiming the return of particular amounts from other creditors who are the parties to such agreements).",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

See also ‘‘— Parallel Debt’’ below. The establishment of certain security interests in Poland requires the execution of appropriate documents and entry into registers or filings with relevant courts. The establishment of the mortgages on real estate in Poland (if such is to be established) will require the execution of a deed before a Polish notary public and submission to and entry (registration) of each mortgage in the land and mortgage register held by the Polish court. The establishment of the pledges will require execution of the pledge agreements and, with respect to registered pledges, the entry (registration) of each registered pledge in the pledge register held by the Polish court. The process of registration of mortgages or registered pledges may take up to several months and, until they are completed, the mortgages or registered pledges will not legally exist. Once they are registered, the statutory priority of the mortgages or registered pledges will be determined by the priority of the filing motions for the registration thereof. In respect of certain rights, such as shares and bank accounts, on which the registered pledges are to be established, the payment obligations under the Additional Notes will be secured additionally by financial pledges, which however may not give the same scope of rights to the secured creditors as the registered pledges. As a general rule, the establishment of the pledges (registered and financial) or mortgages over the assets of a Polish Guarantor will not prevent third party creditors from initiating enforcement proceedings under the Polish Code of Civil Procedure to satisfy their claims from the assets encumbered by the pledges or mortgages. In such event, the Security Agent will be able to participate in the distribution of funds resulting from such enforcement and its claims will have priority over unsecured claims of third parties (except for certain court enforcement expenses, alimony claims and employee and pension claims) and claims secured with the lower ranking pledges or mortgages according to the order of priorities set forth in accordance with the Polish Code of Civil Procedure. 259 ----- In respect of the registered or financial pledges, the Security Agent will have the right to satisfy claims secured with such pledges by assuming title to the pledged assets on the terms set out in the respective pledge agreements. Regarding the registered pledges, it would be also possible for the Security Agent to satisfy its claims by selling such assets in an auction made by a notary public or a court enforcement officer in priority of other creditors. In respect of the registered pledges on the so-called collection of assets, the Security Agent will have the right to satisfy claims secured with such pledges also by leasing the pledgor’s enterprise to a third party or handing-over such enterprise to a receiver (a manager). However, if any third party creditor initiates enforcement proceedings to satisfy their claims from the assets encumbered by such pledges, the Security Agent will not be able to exercise any such specific method of enforcement of the registered pledges (by taking the title to the encumbered assets, by sale of such assets via an auction made by a notary public or a court enforcement officer, and in the event of pledges established on the collection of assets and rights, also by leasing the pledgor’s enterprise to a third party or handing-over such enterprise to a receiver (a manager)), but will only be entitled to enforcement of such pledges via a standard court enforcement process which is usually considered as more time-consuming and more expensive for the secured creditor. Additionally, in insolvency proceedings, the bankruptcy receiver retains the discretion to prevent the Security Agent from acquiring title to the pledged assets or from sale of such assets via an auction made by a notary public or a court enforcement officer or may even refrain from liquidating (selling) such encumbered assets separately, and may sell the entire business of the bankrupt entity (entire bankruptcy estate) as a going concern, if he/she considers that such sale would be more commercially beneficial. Polish law does not recognize the enterprise pledge/mortgage (i.e., one security interest over the whole business of an entity). In particular, without limitation, mortgages on real estate and pledges on movable assets or transferrable rights or the assignments of such rights are separate security interests from which the secured creditors have to satisfy separately. The result of this is that in the enforcement process the sale of the whole business of an entity that provided security interests over its assets as a going concern may be impossible in practice (this limitation does not apply to the bankruptcy receiver selling the entire business of the bankrupt entity (entire bankruptcy estate) as a going concern if such a sale would be more commercially beneficial — see above). In the event of enforcement of a pledge on shares in a Polish company, not only do the Polish regulations relating to the pledge apply, but also the provisions of Polish company law with respect to transfer of shares have to be adhered to. Further, the pledge over shares will be of limited economic value when the company whose shares are pledged becomes insolvent. The security established or that will be established for the benefit of the Security Agent in Poland includes or will include both financial pledges and registered pledges over the same assets. The co-existence of registered and financial pledges established as encumbrances over a single asset, securing the same claim, is not expressly provided for under the Polish law and we cannot assure you that the validity of the coexisting registered and financial pledges established in favor of the bank creditors and the Security Agent would not be subject to challenge, for example, under concepts of over collateralization and/or violation of principles of social co-existence. It is prohibited under Polish law to make a covenant under which the owner of the real property undertakes to a creditor secured by mortgage on such real property that it shall not dispose of or encumber such property before the expiration of the mortgage. The registered pledges secure claims up to a given amount stated in the respective pledge agreements. The mortgages secure claims up to a given amount stated in the respective notarial deeds. If any such mortgage is considered as excessive (over-collateralization), the owner of the property so encumbered may request that the mortgage amount be reduced. The Polish mortgage law was subject to a major amendment which entered into force on February 20, 2011. In particular, one of the changes was the introduction of the concept of over-collateralization to the Polish mortgage law. There is no case law or practice in respect of these new rules that clearly define the boundaries between a security which exceeds the value of the debt, but is still acceptable, and a security which must be recognized as over-collateralization. Therefore, it is uncertain how these new rules of the Polish mortgage law will be interpreted by Polish courts or how these new rules law and their interpretation will affect the other provisions of Polish law (for example, with respect to a registered pledge). 260 -----",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

U. 2014.1380), the acquisition of real estate in_ Poland or the acquisition of shares in a Polish company which owns real estate in Poland or any other action through which such Polish company becomes controlled by a foreign entity, in certain situations requires a permit from the Polish Ministry of Internal Affairs and Administration (an ‘‘MOI Permit’’). The Polish Law on the Acquisition of Real Estate by Foreigners provides for a number of exemptions from the duty to obtain the MOI Permit. In particular, such duty is waived with respect to persons domiciled in countries which are members of the European Economic Area. However, these exemptions are not absolute and they do not apply to certain types of real estates. Pursuant to the provisions of the Law on the Acquisition of Real Estate by Foreigners, if a Polish Guarantor hold, or acquire, land which may be purchased by persons domiciled in European Union member states only subject to prior receipt of an MOI Permit, an acquisition, by the Security Agent or by other entities, of shares in such Polish Guarantor in the course of enforcement of the pledges established on such shares, or an acquisition, by the Security Agent or by other entities, of real estate in the course of enforcement of the mortgages, may also require such an MOI Permit.

Therefore, if the Security Agent enforces the registered pledges by way of an acquisition of title to the encumbered shares or other assets or by exercising the voting rights in respect of shares encumbered by pledges (registered or financial pledges), it may require prior approval(s) of the respective antimonopoly authority(ies).

For example, in the case of registered pledges, the time lapse typically takes from one to four weeks, in all cases depending on a given register and provided that the applications were properly filed and paid for. Moreover, the pledge over shares of the Polish Guarantors will become effective against the Polish Guarantor once the Polish Guarantor is notified of the establishment of such pledge.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

Such security interests cannot be held for the benefit of a third party by e.g. a pledgee which does not itself hold the secured claim. The holders of interests in the Additional Notes from time to time will not be parties to the security documents. In order to permit the holders of the Additional Notes from time to time to benefit from pledges granted to the security agent under Polish law, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of a ‘‘parallel debt.’’ Pursuant to such parallel debt, the security agent becomes the holder of a claim towards each obligor equal to the sum of any amounts payable by that obligor under, in particular, the Additional Notes and the Indenture (the ‘‘Parallel Debt Obligation’’). The pledges and other security interests governed by Polish law will directly and exclusively secure the Parallel Debt Obligation, and not the obligations under the Additional Notes or the Indenture, and such security interests will be established not for the benefit of holders of the Additional Notes directly but for the benefit of the Security Agent only. The Parallel Debt Obligation is in the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Additional Notes and the Guarantees (the ‘‘Principal Obligations’’), and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations will discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt Obligation and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt Obligation will discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. 261 ----- The financing structures and security interests based on the parallel debt are subject to risks under Polish law. Polish law does not regulate expressly parallel debt and there have been no decisions of the Supreme Court of Poland clearly recognizing such structures as parallel debt. There is some practice in Poland in respect of establishing the security interests to secure parallel debt: registration courts enter registered pledges and mortgages which secure parallel debts and in limited number of decisions the Supreme Court of Poland, in the reasoning of such decisions, indirectly recognized the parallel debt. However, in the Polish legal system decisions of courts, including the Supreme Court of Poland, are not source of law, the concept of parallel debt is not specifically regulated in Polish law and the practice relating to parallel debt is still limited. Therefore, we cannot assure you that such parallel debt, and thus the validity of the security interests securing such parallel debt, will not be subject to challenge.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

In particular, establishing security and paying an undue debt (dług niewymagalny), which was given or made by the bankrupt entity within two months before filing the bankruptcy petition, are ineffective towards the bankruptcy estate. However, the receiver of such payment or beneficiary of such security may, by bringing an appropriate action or charge, seek the recognition of such acts as effective if at the time they were performed it was unaware of the existence of grounds for declaring bankruptcy of the payer or grantor of security. A Guarantee or security granted within six months before the filing of the bankruptcy petition will be ineffective towards the bankruptcy estate, if they were granted by the bankrupt entity to its partners or shareholders, their representatives or spouses of the same, or affiliates, their partners or shareholders, representatives, or spouses of the same as well as with another company, in the event of either being the controlling company. The Guarantees granted within one year before the filing of the motion for bankruptcy will also be deemed ineffective towards the bankruptcy estate if the value of the Guarantees significantly exceeded the consideration for a Polish Guarantor, or there was no consideration for a Polish Guarantor. It is not entirely clear under the Polish Bankruptcy Law whether the Guarantees are subject to such clawback provisions. Also, mortgages, pledges, registered pledges or maritime mortgages established in the year preceding the bankruptcy declaration may be declared ineffective towards the bankruptcy estate by the judge commissioner if the bankrupt entity was not a personal debtor of the secured creditor and did not obtain any benefit whatsoever in connection with the establishment of such security interest. This rule shall apply respectively in situations where an encumbrance was established in exchange for a manifestly low (niewsp´ołmiernie niskie) consideration. Regardless of the value of the consideration received by the bankrupt, the judge-commissioner will declare encumbrances ineffective towards the bankruptcy estate if they secure debts of the bankrupt company’s partners or shareholders, their representatives or spouses of the same, or affiliates, their partners or shareholders, representatives, or spouses of the same as well as with another company, in the event of either being the controlling company. The transaction security (such as mortgages, pledges and security assignments of rights) and the Guarantees may be affected by the provisions of Art. 527 of the Civil Code pursuant to which a transaction effected by a debtor to the detriment of its creditors, i.e., where the debtor became insolvent or became insolvent to a greater extent as a result of the transaction and a third party has gained a benefit, each of the creditors (or, if the debtor is declared bankrupt, the relevant bankruptcy officer) may demand that the transaction be declared ineffective if: (1) the debtor consciously acted to the creditors’ detriment, and (2) the third party knew or, had it acted with due diligence, could have known that the debtor was acting to the detriment of its other creditors (and the third party’s knowledge that the debtor consciously acted to the creditors’ detriment is presumed if the entrepreneur who received the benefit as a result of the transaction with the debtor remained in a permanent economic relationship with such debtor). In addition, if the Polish Guarantor’s entering into a given agreement made it wholly or partially impossible to satisfy a third party’s claim, such third party may request that the court declare such an agreement ineffective towards that party, provided the Polish Guarantor and the other party to the agreement knew of the third party’s claim or if the agreement was for no consideration. 262 ----- The assets, receivables and other rights transferred by the debtor for security purposes under the assignment agreements will not be excluded from the bankruptcy estate on the debtor’s bankruptcy. Instead, assets transferred under such assignment agreements, and claims secured by such assignment agreements, will be treated accordingly as assets being subject to, and claims secured by, the pledge. In the event that a Polish Guarantor is declared bankrupt, the receivable debts which are secured by the pledges or mortgages established over the assets of the Polish Guarantor are placed (either upon a motion of a creditor or ex officio) on the list of receivables. The consequences for such security differ depending on the way the insolvency proceedings are carried out. In the case of the arrangement bankruptcy proceedings claims secured on the bankrupt entity’s assets by mortgage, pledge, registered pledge or transfer of title to movables, receivables or other rights, are not subject to arrangement to the extent covered by the value of assets on which security was established. Notwithstanding that, a creditor whose claims are so secured may consent to being subject to arrangement. If the creditor consents to its claims being subject to the arrangement, the above rights remain in force; however, such rights secure the claims in the amount and on the terms as may be changed (affected) by the arrangement. The arrangement does not infringe the rights resulting from the mortgage or pledges, if they were established on the assets of a third party. In the case of the liquidation bankruptcy proceedings, all assets of the debtor, including these on which the mortgages and pledges were established, are included in the bankruptcy estate and are, in general (see the next paragraph), subject to the sale in the course of the insolvency proceedings. Sums obtained from the liquidation (sale) of assets encumbered with mortgages and/or pledges, less the costs of liquidation (sale) of the said assets and other costs of insolvency proceedings capped at 10% of the sum received from the liquidation of the security asset are allocated to satisfy the creditors whose claims were secured on these assets. Amounts remaining after satisfaction of these claims are included in the funds of the bankruptcy estate.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

Financial assistance is understood very broadly as providing by a company, directly or indirectly, any financing for the purposes of the acquisition of shares issued by that company, inter alia by granting of credit, loan, guarantee or security. The company may provide such financial assistance only if all of the following conditions are specified: (1) the financing is provided by a joint-stock company on arm’s length basis, including, without limitation, with respect to interest payable to the company and security established in favor of the company and after conducting by the company of a due diligence in respect of the debtor’s financial position; (2) the acquisition of the company’s shares, for the purposes of which the financing is provided, is made at a fair price; (3) the financing could only be granted up to the amount of the joint-stock company’s reserve capital created for that purpose; such reserve capital can only be created out of funds which, pursuant to the applicable rules of Polish law, can be paid out as dividends; (4) the joint-stock company’s general meeting must adopt in advance an appropriate resolution, which must be based on a management board’s report, which must: (a) indicate the grounds and objectives for providing such financing; (b) confirm that the financing is in the joint-stock company’s interests; and (c) set out terms and conditions for such financing, including the security interest granted to the joint-stock company, a justified price as well as the risks and impact on the joint-stock company’s solvency; and (5) the management board’s report must be filed with the registry court and published. These financial assistance restrictions may affect the Guarantees and security granted by a Polish Guarantor which has the legal form of a joint-stock company (sp´ołka akcyjna or S.A.). Additionally, in the Polish legal doctrine opinions are expressed that the financial assistance rules may apply (indirectly) to limited liability companies (sp´ołka z ograniczon˛a odpowiedzialno´sci˛a or sp. z o.o.) if they are subsidiaries of a jointstock company which is subject (directly) to financial assistance rules, and therefore there is a risk that 263 ----- provision of financing by a subsidiary of a joint-stock company (even if such subsidiary is not a joint-stock company but e.g. a limited liability company) would be considered as indirect financial assistance provided by such joint-stock company. Polish law does not provide specific limitations on financial assistance with respect to a limited liability company. However, a Polish limited liability company should comply with both the general corporate laws and the insolvency laws which may provide certain limitations on the enforcement of the Guarantees. In accordance with Art. 189 sec. 2 of the Polish Commercial Companies Code, shareholders of a limited liability company may not receive any payments out of a company’s assets which are necessary for the share capital to be fully paid up. A more general Art. 189 sec. 1 prohibits the return of capital to such shareholders. In relation to a Polish joint-stock company, Art. 344 sec. 1 of the Polish Commercial Companies Code stipulates that no payments for shares may be reimbursed to a shareholder, either fully or partially, except as allowed by the law for the duration of the company’s existence. In the Polish legal doctrine opinions are expressed that in certain situations, for example when the financial standing of a company entering into a transaction is poor and the shareholder of such a company benefits from a transaction, it may constitute in fact the return of capital to the shareholder. A breach of these rules results in the shareholders’ obligation to return the payments up to the amount of the share capital. Therefore, any guarantee under the Guarantees by any of the Guarantors incorporated under Polish law in such legal form could be affected, or could be set aside, to the extent that it would result in a reduction of its assets necessary to fully cover its share capital in breach of Art. 189 sec. 2 of the Polish Commercial Companies Code, may be considered a return of capital prohibited by Art. 189 sec.1 of the Polish Commercial Companies Code, or a payment prohibited by Art. 344 sec. 1 of the Polish Commercial Companies Code. Under the Guarantees, the obligations of the Guarantors incorporated under Polish law are also subject to the application of laws on bankruptcy and insolvency, and the laws on rehabilitation proceedings, as set out in the Polish Bankruptcy Law. Specifically, pursuant to Art. 11 sec. 2 of the Polish Bankruptcy Law, a corporate entity is deemed to be insolvent if its obligations (zobowi˛azania) exceed the value of its assets (maj˛atek), even if it discharges those liabilities on a current basis. Given certain legal controversies regarding the application of this rule (especially to future and contingent liabilities), and in order to mitigate the possibility that a Polish Guarantor could be declared bankrupt under this rule, the liability of certain Guarantors incorporated under Polish law on account of payments under the Guarantees may be limited to the amount equivalent to the Polish Guarantor’s net positive assets.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

Upon liquidation of any U.K. Obligor, the order of priorities is such that debts due by it to any holders of fixed charges over U.K. assets are paid first out of the realization proceeds of assets subject to such fixed charges (subject to the prior payment of the costs of preservation and realization of the fixed charge assets). Where there are floating charges, liquidation expenses (discussed further below), preferential creditors, and unsecured creditors to the extent of the ‘‘ring-fenced’’ fund (discussed further below) may (to the extent the other assets of the U.K. Obligor are insufficient to discharge them) be paid out of the proceeds of realization of assets subject to those floating charges in priority to payments to creditors secured by virtue of those floating charges. Thereafter, any debts owing to holders of the floating charges would be paid to the extent they are secured by that charge. The categories of preferential debts include certain amounts payable in respect of occupational pension schemes relating to contributions due but unpaid 264 ----- and employee remuneration up to a specified amount. A certain part of the net proceeds of the realization of the assets covered by a floating charge (up to a maximum of £600,000) would be ‘‘ring-fenced’’ and made available pro rata to unsecured creditors. Unsecured debts which are not preferential debts would be paid from the proceeds of realizations of unsecured assets (if any) and, after the secured liabilities have been met, from the proceeds of realization of relevant secured assets. As discussed further below, certain of the security interests over U.K. assets expected to be created in favor of the security agent will be expressed to be fixed charges, but there is no certainty that the security will take effect as a fixed charge and it may well take effect as a floating charge. Where no security is provided to secure the obligations of a U.K. Obligor, any principal debt or guarantee obligation of that U.K. Obligor will be unsecured. _Liquidation Expenses_ The Insolvency Act 1986 (the ‘‘U.K. Insolvency Act’’) broadly states that in a liquidation of a company, where the assets available for payment of its general creditors (excluding any amount ring-fenced for unsecured debts as described above) are not sufficient to meet the liquidation expenses, certain specified liquidation expenses can be claimed out of the realization proceeds of assets subject to a floating charge and, for these purposes, rank ahead of preferential debts and floating chargees’ claims. In the case of litigation expenses, this is subject to rules restricting the application of this provision to certain litigation expenses approved by the floating chargee and any preferential creditors or the court. Consequently, realizations by secured creditors upon the enforcement of floating charges securing any principal or guarantee obligation to the Noteholders could potentially be reduced by the amount of any liquidation expenses. If any fixed security is validly created, any claims of creditors holding such fixed security would rank ahead of any such liquidation expenses. The creditors holding the security would though, pay the expenses of realizing their security directly to the liquidator or other person (such as a receiver or security trustee) who disposed of the secured assets on their behalf. _Administration_ Administration is an insolvency procedure under the U.K. Insolvency Act pursuant to which a company may be reorganized or its assets realized under the protection of a statutory moratorium. A company may be put into administration either pursuant to a court order or via an out-of-court process. Broadly speaking (and subject to specific conditions), a company can be placed into administration at the application of, among others, the U.K. Obligor itself, its directors or one or more of its creditors (including contingent and prospective creditors). A holder of a qualifying floating charge over the assets of the U.K. Obligor also has the right to appoint an administrator. In addition, he has the right to intervene in an application made for administration proceeding by another person by nominating an alternative administrator or, in certain very specific circumstances, by blocking the appointment altogether by the appointment of an administrative receiver. An administrator may only be appointed (either by a court or via the out-of-court process) if there is sufficient evidence (which varies depending on whether the method of appointment) including that (a) the company proposed to be the subject of the order is or is likely to become ‘‘unable to pay its debts’’ and (b) that the administration is reasonably likely to achieve one of the statutory objectives of administration. Administration proceedings are supposed to achieve one of three objectives that must be considered successively: rescuing the company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole than if the company went into immediate liquidation or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable, and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realizing property to make a distribution to secured or preferential creditors. Broadly speaking, an interim moratorium comes into effect when an application for an administration order (in the case of court appointment) or a notice of intention to appoint an administrator (in the case of an out of court appointment) is made. At the commencement of the appointment of an administrator, a full statutory moratorium applies Pursuant to both an interim and full moratorium of a U.K. Obligor, no creditor could take any action against that U.K. Obligor, including, among other things, commencing a legal process against the U.K. Obligor, winding up the U.K. Obligor or enforcing security or repossessing goods in the U.K. Obligor’s possession under a hire purchase or similar agreement, without the permission of the court or (in the case of a full moratorium) the consent of the administrator. However, certain creditors of a company in administration may be able to realize their security over that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the 265 ----- moratorium in relation to a ‘‘security financial collateral arrangement’’ (generally, cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradable capital market debt instruments) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003. Subject to the above points, were a U.K. Obligor to enter administration, it is possible that the security granted by it may not be enforced while it is in administration. Similarly, whilst any principal debt or guarantee obligation owed by it would be accelerated or demanded, no meaningful enforcement action could be taken in respect of any failure to pay. _Expenses of the administration_ Broadly speaking, expenses that qualify as expenses of the administration (and which include, among others, expenses properly incurred by the administrator in performing his functions in the administration and necessary disbursements incurred in the course of the administration) enjoy priority status, in a similar way to liquidation expenses (as described above) although the categories of expenses are slightly different. In particular, expenses of the administration can be claimed out of the realization proceeds of assets subject to a floating charge and, for these purposes and, to the extent the company’s other assets are insufficient to discharge them, rank ahead of preferential debts and floating chargees’ claims. Administration can be used as a proceeding in which to make distributions to creditors like a liquidation in which case claims of creditors may be submitted to the administrator, although court approval generally will be required before he can make a distribution to unsecured creditors. Time limits may be set for receipt and processing of claims before interim dividends are paid. _Small Companies Moratorium_ Certain ‘‘small companies’’ may, for the purposes of putting together proposals for a company voluntary arrangement, seek court protection from their creditors by way of a ‘‘moratorium’’ for a period of up to 28 days, with the option for creditors to extend this protection for up to a further 2 months (although the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform may, by order, extend or reduce the duration of either period). A ‘‘small company’’ is defined for these purposes by reference to whether the company meets certain tests relating to a company’s balance sheet, total turnover and average number of employees in a particular period (although the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform may, by order, modify the moratorium eligibility qualifications and the definition of a ‘‘small company’’). During the period for which a moratorium is in force in relation to a small company, among other things, no winding up may be commenced (except in very limited circumstances, for example where the U.K. Secretary of State considers it to be in the public interest to do so) or administrator or administrative receiver appointed to that company, no security created by that company over its property may be enforced (except (1) with the leave of the Court or (2) in the case of existence of eligible financial collateral arrangements under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No 2) Regulations 2003 whereby the requirement to get a court order before enforcing security over small companies will not apply), no other proceedings or legal process may be commenced or continued in relation against that company (except with the leave of the Court) and the company’s ability to make payments in respect of debts and liabilities existing at the date of the filing for the moratorium is curtailed. Certain small companies may, however, be excluded from being eligible for a moratorium (although the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform may, by regulations, modify such exclusions). As the law currently stands, companies that on the date of filing are party to an agreement which is or forms part of a capital market arrangement are excluded from being eligible for this small companies moratorium. _Disposal of secured assets while subject to insolvency proceedings_ If a company is the subject of (i) a statutory moratorium as a result of either entering administration or (ii) the small companies moratorium, and either (x) the holder of security created by that company (other than financial collateral as above described) consents or (y) if the Court gives leave, the relevant company or its administrator may dispose of the secured property as if it were not subject to the security. In addition an administrator can dispose of assets subject to a floating charge without seeking the consent of the chargeholder or the leave of the Court. Where the property in question is subject to a security which was created as a floating charge, the chargee will have the same priority in respect of any property of the company directly or indirectly 266 ----- representing the property disposed of as he would have had in respect of the property subject to the security. Where the security in question is other than a floating charge, it shall be a condition of the chargee’s consent or the leave of the Court that the net proceeds of the disposal shall be applied towards discharging the sums secured by the security. _Possible challenges to security interests Vulnerable transactions_ Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of a company would have certain powers to apply to court to challenge transactions entered into by a U.K. Obligor if that U.K. Obligor is unable to pay its debts at the time of the transaction or becomes unable to pay its debts as a result of the transaction. A U.K. Obligor will be deemed to be unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a ‘‘cash flow’’ basis (i.e., unable to pay its debts as they fall due), or if it is insolvent on a ‘‘balance sheet’’ basis (the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account contingent and prospective liabilities). A transaction might be challenged as a transaction at an undervalue if it involved the U.K. Obligor making a gift or otherwise entering into a transaction on terms that it received no consideration, or the U.K. Obligor received significantly less value than under the transaction it gave in return. Where an undervalue transaction is proved, the court has powers to make any order it thinks fit in order to restore the position to what it would have been had the U.K. Obligor not entered into that transaction. A court should not intervene, however, if it is satisfied that the U.K. Obligor entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purposes of carrying on its business and if, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit the U.K. Obligor. The court can set aside transactions at an undervalue entered into by the U.K. Obligor within a period of two years ending with the onset of its insolvency (as this date is more specifically defined in the U.K. Insolvency Act). In principle, both a Guarantee granted by a U.K. Obligor or any Collateral provided by it could be challenged as a transaction at an undervalue. A transaction might also be challenged as a preference where a U.K. Obligor has done something or suffered something to be done which has the effect of putting a creditor, surety or guarantor in a better position than the one that person would have been in the event of the U.K. Obligor going into insolvent liquidation. If a transaction is found to have given a preference to a creditor, surety or guarantor of the company then the court may make such order as it thinks fit for restoring the position to what it would have been if the company had not given that preference. A court should not intervene however when the U.K. Obligor, in deciding to give the preference, was not influenced by a desire to put the person who was given the preference in a better position in the event of insolvent liquidation of the U.K. Obligor. If the preference is given to a person connected to the U.K. Obligor (other than an employee), the court can look back and set aside those preferences entered into in the period of two years ending with the date of the onset of the U.K. Obligor’s insolvency. If the person is not connected to the U.K. Obligor, the court can only look back and set aside those preferences entered into in the period of six months ending on the onset of the U.K. Obligor’s insolvency. Further, an administrator or a liquidator can apply to court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction. The court can review extortionate credit transactions entered into by a U.K. Obligor up to three years before the day on which the U.K. Obligor entered into administration or went into liquidation. A transaction is ‘‘extortionate’’ if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, the terms of it are (or were) such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit or it otherwise grossly contravened ordinary principles of fair dealing. If a transaction entered into by a U.K. Obligor is found to be an extortionate credit transaction the court can make one or more orders specified in the U.K. Insolvency Act, including an order setting aside the whole or any part of any obligation created by the extortionate credit transaction, an order varying the terms of the extortionate credit transaction or the terms on which any security for the extortionate credit transaction is held, or an order requiring any person to pay to the administrator or liquidator any sums paid to that person, by virtue of the extortionate credit transaction, by the U.K. Obligor. The U.K. Insolvency Act provides that, in certain circumstances, a floating charge granted by a company during the ‘‘relevant time’’ may be invalid in whole or in part if certain conditions are met. In the case of a floating charge which is created in favor of a person that is not connected to a U.K. Obligor, the relevant time is deemed to be the period of 12 months ending with the onset of the U.K. Obligor’s insolvency provided that at the time the charge was granted the U.K. Obligor was unable to pay its debts or became unable to pay its debts as a result of the transaction in respect of which the floating charge was granted. If the floating charge 267 ----- is created in favor of a person connected to the U.K. Obligor, the relevant look back period is a period of two years ending with the onset of insolvency. As a result of the rights to challenge described above, in the event that a U.K. Obligor becomes unable to pay its debts within a period of up to two years of the issuance of the Additional Notes (or three years if the Additional Notes or any related transaction are found to be an extortionate credit transaction), an administrator or liquidator is appointed and the conditions contemplated in the relevant legal provisions are met, the provision of the relevant Guarantees and Collateral may be challenged by a liquidator or administrator, or a court may set aside the granting of the Guarantees and Collateral as invalid. _Recharacterization of fixed security interests_ There is a possibility that a court could find that the fixed security interests expressed to be created by the security documents governed by English law properly take effect as floating charges as the description given to them as fixed charges is not determinative. Whether the purported fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating security interests will depend, among other things, on whether the secured party has the requisite degree of control over the U.K. Obligor’s ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the holder of the security, in practice. Where a U.K. Obligor is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a purported fixed charge in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee, the court would be likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge. While recharacterization is a risk for all attempts to create fixed security, it is a particular risk in relation to attempts to create fixed security over receivables. This is because even if a company purports to grant fixed security over its receivables, it will likely retain, in practice, the ability to deal with its receivables in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee. If any fixed security interests are recharacterized as floating security interests, the claims of (i) any unsecured creditors of the relevant U.K. Obligor in respect of that part of the U.K. Obligor’s net property which is ring fenced (see explanation about ring fencing above); and (ii) certain statutorily defined preferential creditors of the U.K. Obligor may have priority over the rights of the security agent to the proceeds of enforcement of such security. In addition, as mentioned above, the expenses of a liquidation or administration would also rank ahead of the claims of the security agent as floating charge holder. _Limitation on enforcement_ The grant of a Guarantee or Collateral by any of the U.K. Obligors in respect of the obligations of another group company must satisfy certain legal requirements. More specifically, such a transaction must be allowed by the respective company’s memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that the above do not allow such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee and the subsequent security can be found to be void and the respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with a U.K. Obligor in good faith, however the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be established for each U.K. Obligor in question by virtue of entering into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in the way that he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the U.K. Obligor for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found as abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court. _Equitable share charge_ The fixed charges over shares granted by certain U.K. Obligors are equitable charges, not legal charges. An equitable charge arises where a chargor transfers the beneficial interest in the shares to the chargee but retains legal title to the shares. Remedies in relation to equitable charges may be subject to equitable considerations or are otherwise at the discretion of the court. _Account banks’ right to set-off_ With respect to the charges over cash deposits (each an ‘‘Account Charge’’) granted by a U.K. Obligor over any of its bank accounts, the banks with which some of those accounts are held (each an ‘‘Account Bank’’) may have reserved their right at any time (whether prior to or upon a crystallization event under the Account Charge) to exercise the rights of netting or set-off to which they are entitled under their cash pooling 268 ----- or other arrangements with that U.K. Obligor. As a result, and if the security granted over those accounts is merely a floating (rather than fixed) charge, the collateral constituted by those bank accounts will be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s netting and set-off rights with respect to the bank accounts charged under the relevant Account Charge. Once the floating charge has crystallized and converted into a fixed charge (as it would on enforcement or the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the relevant U.K. Guarantor) the collateral will no longer be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s netting and set-off rights, since the Account Bank will only be entitled to exercise its netting and set-off rights whilst the bank accounts are subject only to floating security. _Transaction defrauding creditors_ Under English insolvency law, where it can be shown that a transaction was at an undervalue and was made for the purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may make, a claim against a company, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of a person in relation to the claim which that person is making or may make, the transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction defrauding creditors. An application to the court for an order to set aside the transaction may be made by an administrator, a liquidator and, subject to certain conditions, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority and the U.K. Pensions Regulator. In addition, any person who is, or who is capable of being, prejudiced by the transaction may (with the leave of the court in the case of a company in administration or liquidation) also bring an application to set aside such transaction. The challenge must be made within 12 years (or in the case of claims for a sum of money, 6 years) from the date that the cause of action arose. The relevant company does not need to be insolvent at the time of the transaction. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction. The relevant court order may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person, whether or not he is the person with whom the transaction was entered into. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the debtor in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances and will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, to pay any sum unless such person was a party to the transaction. _Post-petition interest_ Any interest accruing under or in respect of the Additional Notes or the amount due under a guarantee given by a U.K. Obligor in respect of any period after the commencement of administration or liquidation proceedings would only be recoverable from any surplus remaining to the U.K. Obligor after the payment of all other debts proved in the proceedings (including accrued and unpaid interest on such debts up to the date of the commencement of the proceedings), provided that such interest may, if there are sufficient realizations from the Collateral, be discharged out of the security recoveries. _Dispositions in Winding-up_ Other than set out in this section, any disposition of a U.K. Obligor’s property made after a compulsory winding-up has commenced is, unless the court orders otherwise, void. The compulsory winding-up of a company is deemed to commence when a winding-up petition is presented by a creditor against the company, rather than the date that court makes the winding-up order (if any). A disposition made: (a) by a secured party as a result of the enforcement of security held by it; and (b) after the presentation of a winding-up petition, will not be void merely because a winding-up petition has already been presented, as such a disposition would be made by the secured party (or its nominee) and not by the company that is the subject of the winding-up petition. _Foreign currency_ Where creditors of a U.K. Obligor are asked to submit formal proofs of claim for their debts, and the debt is payable in a currency other than pounds sterling (such as any debt arising under the Additional Notes or any guarantee thereof) the amount of the debt must be converted into pounds sterling at the ‘‘official exchange rate’’ prevailing on the date the company went into liquidation or administration. This is the case regardless of any contrary agreement between the parties. The ‘‘official exchange rate’’ for these purposes is the middle market rate in the London Foreign Exchange Market at the close of business, as published for the date in question. In the absence of any such published rate, foreign currency debts are converted into pounds sterling at such rate as the court determines. 269 -----",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

On the basis of these factors, an English court may conclude that the U.K. Obligors have their ‘‘center of main interests,’’ within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation, in England and therefore insolvency proceedings in England constituting ‘‘main insolvency proceedings’’ under article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation may be commenced in respect of a U.K. Obligor.

A summary of the more important Group accounting policies is set out below. The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The directors deemed it appropriate to prepare the accounts on a going concern basis having given due regard to the trading results and capital structure of the Group. In particular the working capital requirements of the Group are met by the Group’s available cash balance combined with the revolving credit facility provided under the agreement with the Company, signed on 8 August 2013. The longer term finance of the Group is provided by senior secured floating and fixed euro and sterling denominated notes (See note 20). These notes have a termination date of 15 July 2020. As a result the directors believe that the Company and all its current subsidiaries will, for the foreseeable future, be able to continue trading and meet all their liabilities as they fall due. There is no material difference between the fair value of financial assets and liabilities and their carrying amount. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Although these judgements, estimates and assumptions are based on management’s best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ. Further details regarding areas requiring significant judgements, estimates and assumptions are provided in the accounting policies below and in the relevant note to the financial statements where applicable. Management have determined that the key areas of judgement, estimate and assumptions to disclose include the nature and obligation of onerous lease provisions, the assessment of the Group’s digital investment as prepaid operating lease commitments and the carrying value of tangible fixed assets",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

A summary of the more important Group accounting policies is set out below. The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The directors deemed it appropriate to prepare the accounts on a going concern basis having given due regard to the trading results and capital structure of the Group. In particular the working capital requirements of the Group are met by the Group’s available cash balance combined with the revolving credit and overdraft facility and certain shareholder loans. The longer term finance of the Group is provided by certain shareholder loans. The immediate parent of the Company, Vougeot Bidco plc, has confirmed it does not currently intend to require repayment of the shareholder loans in the next period. As a result the directors believe that the Company and Group will, for the foreseeable future, be able to continue trading and meet all their liabilities as they fall due. There is no material difference between the fair value of financial assets and liabilities and their carrying amount. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Although these judgements, estimates and assumptions are based on management’s best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ. Further details regarding areas requiring significant judgements, estimates and assumptions are provided in the accounting policies below and in the relevant note to the financial statements where applicable. Management have determined that the key areas of judgement, estimate and assumptions to disclose include the nature and obligation of onerous lease provisions, the assessment of the Group’s digital investment as prepaid operating lease commitments and the carrying value of tangible fixed assets.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

A summary of the more important Group accounting policies is set out below, together with an explanation of where changes have been made to previous policies on the adoption of new accounting standards in the period. The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The directors deemed it appropriate to prepare the accounts on a going concern basis having given due regard to the trading results and capital structure of the Group. In particular the working capital requirements of the Group are met by the Group’s available cash balance combined with the revolving credit facility provided under the Senior Debt Agreements with Vue Holdings (UK) Limited, a subsidiary undertaking of the Company, signed on 7 November 2010. The Group has also provided that funds are available for planned capital expenditures by way of a facility with a final draw down date of 21 December 2013 (extended to December 2016 under the refinancing — see note 35). The longer term finance of the Group is provided under an A and B loan structure with maturities of 6 and 7 years respectively. Further finance is provided by subordinated shareholder funding with maturity dates on the earlier of 31 December 2020 or an ‘exit event’. As a result Vue Entertainment International Limited directors believe that the Company and all its current subsidiaries will, for the foreseeable future, be able to continue trading and meet all their liabilities as they fall due. In December 2012 the Company entered into new senior debt arrangements (see note 35). There is no material difference between the fair value of financial assets and liabilities and their carrying amount. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. Further details regarding areas requiring significant assumptions and estimates are provided in the accounting policies below and in the relevant note to the financial statements where applicable.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

There is no difference between the profit after tax and the recognised gains and losses for the period. Vue Beteiligungs AG was incorporated on 23 March 2012 as a holding company to acquire CinemaxX AG. On 10 July 2012 Vue Beteiligungs AG announced its intention to launch a voluntary public takeover offer for all outstanding shares of CinemaxX AG, a group listed on the Frankfurt and Hamburg Stock Exchanges. On 7 August 2012, Vue Beteiligungs AG acquired 91.34% of the share capital of CinemaxX AG as a result of this public offer. As at the Company’s financial period end, 95.15% of all shares in CinemaxX AG had been acquired. From 1 January 2012, the first day of CinemaxX AG’s latest financial year, to 7 August 2012, the effective date of acquisition, CinemaxX AG had turnover of c117,416k and an operating profit of c10,788k, profit before taxation was c6,331k and taxation c4,949k. The profit after tax for CinemaxX AG for the year ended 31 December 2011 was c18,778k. There is no difference between the profit after tax and the recognised gains and losses for the period. The identifiable assets and liabilities of the company acquired are included in the consolidated balance sheet at their fair value at the date of acquisition, and its results included in the profit and loss account from the date of the acquisition. The difference between the fair value of the consideration given and the fair values of the net assets of the entity acquired is accounted for as goodwill. The discounting rate used in assessing the value in use of the assets is the estimated weighted average cost of capital employed by the Group, adjusted as necessary for any particular risks of the subsidiary being reviewed. The weighted average cost of capital employed by the Group has been calculated as the weighted average of the internal rate of return applied in the equity funding and the Group’s bank debt interest rate. Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date. A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits against which to recover carried forward tax losses and from which the future reversal of underlying timing differences can be deducted. Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

These taxable losses are available to be offset against future taxable profits. Revaluation adjustments reflect the write-down of goodwill. Fair value adjustments have been made for the alignment of accounting policies to be in line with Group policy. The intangible fixed asset adjustment reflects IT software licenses being included as tangible fixed assets and the reversal of goodwill relating to the purchase of a new site which under Group policy will not be recognised as no formal contract has been signed. The tangible fixed asset adjustment reflects IT software licenses reclassified from intangible fixed assets. Additionally the leasing of buildings and other cinema assets are to be treated as operating leases rather than finance leases, in line with UK GAAP. The provisions adjustment relates to the reversal of provisions for the purchase of a new site which under Group policy will not be recognised as no formal contract had been signed. The deferred tax adjustment reflects the carried forward losses available to be utilised by the Group.

A summary of the more important Group accounting policies is set out below, together with an explanation of where changes have been made to previous policies on the adoption of new accounting standards in the period. The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The directors deemed it appropriate to prepare the accounts on a going concern basis having given due regard to the trading results and capital structure of the Group. In particular the working capital requirements of the Group are met by the Group’s available cash balance combined with the revolving credit facility provided under the Senior Debt Agreements with Vue Holdings (UK) Limited, a subsidiary undertaking of the Company, signed on 7 November 2010. The Group has also provided that funds are available for planned capital expenditures by way of a facility with a final draw down date of 21 December 2013. The longer term finance of the Group is provided under an A and B loan structure with maturities of 6 and 7 years respectively. Further finance is provided by subordinated shareholder funding with maturity dates on the earlier of 31 December 2020 or an ‘exit event’. As a result Vue Entertainment International Limited directors believe that the Company and all its current subsidiaries will, for the foreseeable future, be able to continue trading and meet all their liabilities as they fall due. There is no material difference between the fair value of financial assets and liabilities and their carrying amount. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. Further details regarding areas requiring significant assumptions and estimates are provided in the accounting policies below and in the relevant note to the financial statements where applicable.",N/A,as_expected,2014,475

A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits against which to recover carried forward tax losses and from which the future reversal of underlying timing differences can be deducted.
