Vougeot Bidco p.l.c. (the ‘‘Issuer’’), a public limited company newly organized under the laws of England and Wales, is offering (the ‘‘Offering’’) £300,000,000 aggregate
principal amount of its 7.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2020 (the ‘‘Fixed Rate Notes’’) and e290,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its Senior Secured Floating
Rate Notes due 2020 (the ‘‘Floating Rate Notes’’), as part of the financing of the proposed acquisition of majority equity ownership of Vue Entertainment International
Limited (the ‘‘Vue Acquisition’’) indirectly by certain clients of Alberta Investment Management Corporation (‘‘AIMCo’’) and by OMERS Administration Corporation
(‘‘OMERS’’). The Fixed Rate Notes and the Floating Rate Notes are collectively referred to herein as the ‘‘Notes’’ unless the context otherwise requires.

The Issuer will pay interest on the Fixed Rate Notes semi-annually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year, commencing on February 1, 2014. The Fixed Rate
Notes will mature on July 15, 2020. The Floating Rate Notes will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to three-month EURIBOR plus 5.25% per year, reset quarterly. The
Issuer will pay interest on the Floating Rate Notes quarterly in arrears on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing on October 15, 2013. The
Floating Rate Notes will mature on July 15, 2020.

The Issuer may redeem the Fixed Rate Notes in whole or in part at any time on or after July 15, 2016 at the redemption prices specified herein. Prior to July 15, 2016, the
Issuer will be entitled to redeem all or part of the Fixed Rate Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest
and Additional Amounts (as defined herein), if any, plus the applicable ‘‘make-whole’’ premium. Prior to July 15, 2016, the Issuer may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate

tax law. Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control, the Issuer may be required to make an offer to repurchase all of the Notes at a redemption
price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any.

The Notes will be senior obligations of the Issuer and will, upon release of the proceeds of the offering of the Notes from the Escrow Accounts (as defined below),
following the Vue Acquisition Completion Date, be guaranteed (the ‘‘Guarantees’’) on a senior secured basis by the Initial Vue Guarantors (as defined herein), following

ratable first-priority basis over the Vue Collateral (as defined herein), the CinemaxX Collateral after the Structure Event (as defined herein) and, after the Multikino
Acquisition Completion Date (as defined herein) if such date occurs after the Vue Acquisition Completion Date, otherwise the Vue Acquisition Completion Date), will be
secured by first-ranking security interests granted on an equal and ratable first-priority basis over the Multikino Collateral (as defined herein). The Vue Collateral and the
Multikino Collateral together comprise the Collateral (as defined herein) that also secures the Revolving Credit Facility (as defined herein). In the event of an enforcement
of the Collateral, the holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from the Collateral only after the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility have been repaid in full. See
‘‘The Offering—Collateral’’ and ‘‘Description of the Notes—Collateral.’’

Pending the completion of the Vue Acquisition, the Issuer will direct the Initial Purchasers (as defined herein) to deposit the gross proceeds from the Offering into
segregated escrow accounts (the ‘‘Escrow Accounts’’). The Escrow Accounts will be controlled by, and pledged on a first-ranking basis in favor of, the Trustee (as
defined herein), on behalf of the holders of the Notes, pursuant to the escrow agreement (the ‘‘Escrow Agreement’’). The release of the escrow proceeds will be subject to
the satisfaction of certain conditions. The Escrow Agreement will provide that £499.4 million (or the equivalent) of the proceeds of the Notes will be released upon the
completion of the Vue Acquisition (the date of such release, the ‘‘Vue Acquisition Completion Date’’) in order to fund such acquisition and £50.0 million (or the equivalent)
of the proceeds will be released upon the Multikino Acquisition Completion Date, if such date occurs after the Vue Acquisition Completion Date, otherwise the Vue
Acquisition Completion Date. If the Vue Acquisition is not completed on or prior to September 30, 2013 (the ‘‘Escrow Longstop Date’’), then all of the Notes will be subject
to a special mandatory redemption. If the Multikino Acquisition is not completed on or prior to (i) the Escrow Longstop Date, if the Vue Acquisition Completion Date has
not yet occurred, or (ii) if the Vue Acquisition Completion Date has occurred, December 1, 2013 (the ‘‘Extended Escrow Longstop Date’’), then £50.0 million (or the
equivalent) (or such lesser or greater amount as left in escrow following release in respect of the Vue Acquisition) aggregate principal amount of the Notes will be subject

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

**Financial Information**

The Issuer was formed as a private limited company under the laws of England and Wales on May 2,
2013, and was reregistered as a public limited company under the laws of England and Wales on July 1,
2013. The Issuer is a holding company formed for the purposes of the Vue Acquisition. Consequently, no
historical financial information relating to the Issuer is available other than an opening balance sheet as
at June 28, 2013 as set out in this offering memorandum. The Issuer has not engaged in any activities
other than those related to its formation and the Transactions. After completion of the Vue Acquisition,
the Issuer’s only material assets and liabilities will be its interest in all of the issued and outstanding
shares of Vue Entertainment International Limited and its outstanding indebtedness incurred in
connection therewith. Going forward, our financials will be consolidated at the level of the Issuer as
required by the Indenture.

The consolidated financial information in this offering memorandum, unless otherwise stated, has been
derived or extracted from:

- the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Vue Entertainment
International Limited as of and for the 18 week periods ended April 4, 2013 and March 29, 2012,
prepared in accordance with best practice as derived from IAS 34;

- the audited consolidated financial statements of Vue Entertainment International Limited as of and
for the 53 week period ended November 29, 2012, prepared in accordance with U.K. GAAP;

- the audited consolidated financial statements of Vue Entertainment International Limited as of
November 24, 2011 and for the 56 week period from its incorporation on October 26, 2010 to
November 24, 2011, which reflects the trading results for the 49 week period from December 21,
2010 (the date upon which it indirectly acquired 100% of the ordinary shares of Vue Entertainment
Investment Limited) to November 24, 2011, prepared in accordance with U.K. GAAP; and

- the audited consolidated financial statements of Vue Entertainment Investment Limited as of and for
the 52 week period ended November 25, 2010, prepared in accordance with U.K. GAAP

(together, the ‘‘Consolidated Financial Statements’’)

Such Consolidated Financial Statements are included in this offering memorandum.

The audited consolidated financial statements referred to above have been extracted from our signed
statutory annual report and financial statements for 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively, although page
references have been modified solely for the convenience of the reader. Furthermore, such financial
statements contain cross-references to other parts of such statutory annual reports and financial
statements; however, such cross-referenced material is not part of, and is not incorporated by reference
into this offering memorandum and should be disregarded for the purpose of this offering
memorandum.

The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Vue Entertainment International
Limited as of and for the 18 week periods ended April 4, 2013 and March 29, 2012 presented in this
offering memorandum have been prepared solely for use in this offering memorandum. Going forward,
we intend to prepare and report our interim financial statements on the basis of four 13 week quarterly
periods for a 52 week financial year period and on the basis of three 13 week quarterly periods and one
14 week quarterly period for a 53 week financial year. The 14 week quarterly period will always be the
fourth quarter.

The consolidated financial information of Vue Entertainment International Limited presented for the
53 weeks ended April 4, 2013 is derived by adding the unaudited interim condensed consolidated profit
and loss account of Vue Entertainment International Limited for the 18 week period ended April 4, 2013
and the consolidated profit and loss account of Vue Entertainment International Limited for the 53 week
period ended November 29, 2012, and subtracting the unaudited interim condensed consolidated profit
and loss account of Vue Entertainment International Limited for the 18 week period ended March 29,
2012. The financial information for the 53 week period ended April 4, 2013 has been prepared for
illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily representative of our results of operations for any future
period or our financial condition at any future date.

The Consolidated Financial Statements in this offering memorandum are presented in pounds sterling
and have been prepared in accordance with U.K. GAAP which differs in certain significant respects from
IFRS. In making an investment decision, investors must rely upon their own examination of us, the terms
of the Offering and the financial information provided herein. Potential investors should consult their own
professional advisors for an understanding of the differences between U.K. GAAP and IFRS.

**Certain Factors Affecting the Comparability of our Consolidated Financial Statements**

Certain factors affect the comparability of our Consolidated Financial Statements in this offering
memorandum, including:

- the annual financial statements of Vue Entertainment International Limited are generally prepared
for either a 52 or a 53 week period ending on a Thursday within one week of November 30, resulting
in financial years which have either 52 or 53 weeks;

- our consolidated financial statements as of November 24, 2011 and for the period from
incorporation on October 26, 2010 to November 24, 2011, include the trading results of Vue
Entertainment Investment Limited from December 21, 2010 which is the date Vue Entertainment
International Limited acquired 100% of the ordinary shares of Vue Entertainment Investment
Limited. As a result, the consolidated financial statements of Vue Entertainment International
Limited for the period ended November 24, 2011 included in this offering memorandum refer to the
56 weeks from October 26, 2010 but include trading results for only 49 weeks;

- we have recently undertaken acquisitions in both our U.K. and Continental Europe segments, as
presented in greater detail in ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
_Results of Operations—Factors Affecting Comparability.’’ As a result, the unaudited interim_
condensed consolidated financial statements of Vue Entertainment International Limited as of and
for the 18 week period ended April 4, 2013 and the consolidated financial statements of Vue
Entertainment International Limited as of and for the 53 week period ended November 29, 2012,
each include (a) the results of operations and financial position of Apollo in the United Kingdom
from the closing date of the acquisition, May 10, 2012 and (b) the results of operations and financial
position of CinemaxX in Germany from the closing date of the acquisition, August 7, 2012; and

- assuming the completion of the Multikino Acquisition (see ‘‘The Transactions—The Multikino
_Acquisition’’), our consolidated results for the current financial year 2013 will reflect a full year of_
consolidated results of the Acquired Businesses and the partial results of Multikino from the date of
its acquisition, and will therefore be impacted by the revenues and expenses of the Acquired
Businesses and Multikino.

**Financial Information of CinemaxX and Multikino**

In addition to our Consolidated Financial Statements, this offering memorandum presents consolidated
financial information of CinemaxX and consolidated financial information of Multikino; which have been
derived or extracted from:

- the audited consolidated financial statements of CinemaxX as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2012, prepared in accordance with IFRS;

- the audited consolidated financial statements of CinemaxX as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2011, prepared in accordance with IFRS;

- the unaudited special purpose interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Multikino for
the three month period ended March 31, 2013, prepared in accordance with IAS 34; and

- the audited special purpose consolidated financial statements of Multikino for the twelve month
period ended December 31, 2012 prepared in accordance with IFRS.

The consolidated financial information of CinemaxX in this offering memorandum is presented in euros.
The consolidated financial information of Multikino in this offering memorandum is presented in złoty.

**Pro Forma Financial Information**

This offering memorandum also includes unaudited pro forma combined financial information of the
Issuer. The unaudited pro forma combined financial information has been derived from the Consolidated
Financial Statements, the consolidated financial statements of Multikino, the pre-acquisition

xiii


-----

consolidated financial information of CinemaxX for the period April 1, 2012 to July 31, 2012, adjusted to
give effect to (i) IFRS to U.K. GAAP differences, (ii) the Vue Acquisition, (iii) the Multikino Acquisition,
(iv) the Financing, and the application of the proceeds therefrom; and are prepared in accordance with
the basis of preparation as described in the notes to the unaudited pro forma combined financial
information. For purposes of this unaudited pro forma combined financial information, the Transactions
are deemed to have occurred on April 4, 2013.

The assumptions underlying the above pro forma adjustments are described in the notes presented in
‘‘Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information,’’ which should be read in conjunction with the
unaudited pro forma combined financial information. Both the Vue Acquisition and Multikino Acquisition
will be accounted for by using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires determination of the
fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the closing date of each acquisition, and allocation of
the purchase price based on such fair values. As of the date of this offering memorandum, in respect of
the Vue Acquisition and the Multikino Acquisition, we have not performed the valuation studies
necessary to estimate the fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the
related allocation of the purchase price. The purchase price allocation in respect of the Vue Acquisition
and the Multikino Acquisition may result in significant adjustments to the historical values of property,
plant and equipment and intangible assets and other assets, liabilities and provisions, resulting in a
significant increase in depreciation and amortization expense. Refer to ‘‘Unaudited Pro Forma Combined
_Financial Information,’’ Note 1(e) to the unaudited pro forma combined income statement and Note 2(b)_
to the unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet for a further discussion of the purchase price
allocation and its impact on our financial position and results.

The unaudited pro forma combined financial information has not been prepared in accordance with the
requirements of Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities Act, the Prospectus Directive or any generally
accepted accounting standards. The unaudited pro forma adjustments are based upon available
information and certain assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Neither the assumptions
underlying the pro forma adjustments nor the resulting unaudited pro forma combined financial
information have been audited or reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted auditing
standards.

The unaudited pro forma combined financial information is for informational purposes only and should
not be considered indicative of actual results that would have been achieved had the Transactions been
completed on the dates indicated and do not purport to indicate our future consolidated results of
operations or financial position. The actual results may differ significantly from those reflected in the
unaudited pro forma combined financial information for a number of reasons, including, but not limited
to, differences in assumptions used to prepare the unaudited pro forma combined financial information.

The unaudited pro forma combined financial information should be read in conjunction with the
information contained in ‘‘Selected Historical Financial Information,’’ ‘‘Management’s Discussion and
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,’’ the Consolidated Financial Statements, the_
consolidated financial statements of Multikino, and the consolidated financial statements of CinemaxX
appearing elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

**Other Financial Measures**

We have presented certain information in this offering memorandum that are non-U.K. GAAP and
non-IFRS measures. As used in this offering memorandum, this information includes ‘‘EBITDA,’’
‘‘Adjusted EBITDA,’’ ‘‘Adjusted EBITDA Margin,’’ ‘‘pro forma EBITDA,’’ ‘‘pro forma Adjusted EBITDA,’’
‘‘EBITDAR’’ and ‘‘Adjusted EBITDAR.’’

Our management believes that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, pro forma EBITDA,
pro forma Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDAR and Adjusted EBITDAR are meaningful for investors because they
provide an analysis of our operating results, profitability and ability to service debt and because EBITDA,
Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, pro forma EBITDA, pro forma Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDAR
and Adjusted EBITDAR are used by our chief operating decision makers to assess our operating results,
establish operational and strategic targets and make business decisions. In addition, we believe that
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, pro forma EBITDA, pro forma Adjusted EBITDA,
EBITDAR and Adjusted EBITDAR are measures commonly used by investors and other interested
parties in our industry. Although we are presenting these measures to enhance the understanding of our
historical operating performance, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, pro forma
EBITDA, pro forma Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDAR and Adjusted EBITDAR or any other non-U.K. GAAP or

xiv


-----

non-IFRS financial measures should not be considered alternatives to operating profit as an indicator of
our operating performance, or alternatives to cash flows from operating activities as measures of our
liquidity. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, pro forma EBITDA, pro forma Adjusted
EBITDA, EBITDAR and Adjusted EBITDAR have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not
consider them in isolation. Some of these limitations are:

- they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or
contractual commitments;

- they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

- they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to service
interest or principal payments, on our debts;

- although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and
amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDAR and
Adjusted EBITDAR do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such
replacements;

- some of the exceptional items that we eliminate in calculating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDAR
and Adjusted EBITDAR reflect cash payments that were made, or will in the future be made; and

- the fact that other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDAR
and Adjusted EBITDAR differently than we do, which limits their usefulness as comparative
measures.

EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, pro forma EBITDA, pro forma Adjusted EBITDA,
EBITDAR and Adjusted EBITDAR are unaudited and are not measures of financial performance under
U.K. GAAP or IFRS. Our computation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, pro forma
EBITDA, pro forma Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDAR and Adjusted EBITDAR and other non-U.K. GAAP
financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. In evaluating
Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDAR and Adjusted EBITDAR, we encourage you to evaluate each and the
reasons we consider it appropriate as a method of supplemental analysis. You should be aware that as
an analytical tool, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDAR and Adjusted EBITDAR are subject to all of the limitations
applicable to EBITDA. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDAR and Adjusted EBITDAR are not audited.
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDAR and Adjusted EBITDAR should be viewed as measures of
operating performance that are a supplement to, and not a substitute for U.K. GAAP or IFRS measures of
income or cash flows, and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of our
competitors.

EBITDA as used in this offering memorandum is not calculated in the same manner as ‘‘Consolidated
EBITDA’’ is calculated pursuant to the Indenture governing the Notes as described under ‘‘Description of
_the Notes’’ or for purposes of any of our other indebtedness._

Certain key performance indicators and other non-financial operating data included in this offering
memorandum are derived from management estimates, are not part of our financial statements or
financial accounting records, and have not been audited or otherwise reviewed by outside auditors,

**MARKET AND INDUSTRY DATA**

Information included in this offering memorandum relating to markets and other industry data pertaining
to our business consists of information from data reports compiled by professional third-party
organizations and analysts, data from external sources, our knowledge of the industries in which we
operate and our own calculations based on such information. In some cases, there is no readily
available external information to validate industry-related analyses and estimates, thus requiring us to
rely on internally developed estimates. While we have compiled, extracted and reproduced industry data
from external sources, including third party, industry or general publications, such as Dodona Research,
Rentrak/EDI, The Cinema Exhibitor’s Association, Media Salles, the British Film Institute and the German
Federal Film Board and other public information, we have not independently verified the data. We cannot
assure you of the accuracy and completeness of, or take any responsibility for, and we have not
independently verified such data. Notwithstanding this, we confirm that this market and industry data
has been accurately reproduced and that as far as we are aware and are able to ascertain from
information published by the external sources referred to above, no facts have been omitted which
would render the reproduced information inaccurate or misleading. We accept responsibility for the
accurate reproduction of information from the sources listed in this paragraph.

Similarly, while we believe our internal estimates to be reasonable, they have not been verified by any
independent sources, and we cannot assure you as to their accuracy. In certain instances, we have
provided certain third-party data, such as market share for the United Kingdom, Germany and Poland,
that may not be comparable across the different markets in which we operate, as convention dictates
varying metrics for measurement across these markets. For example, data on market share by GBOR is
not collected in Poland, and therefore we are unable to present this information for that market.

**SUMMARY**

_This summary highlights select information from this offering memorandum. It is not complete and does_
_not contain all of the information that you should consider before investing in the Notes. You should read_
_this offering memorandum carefully in its entirety, including the sections entitled ‘‘Risk Factors,’’_
_‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,’’ and_
_‘‘Business,’’ as well as our audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited interim financial_
_statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this offering memorandum and any other_
_documents referred to herein._

**Overview**

We believe we are Europe’s second largest cinema operator by number of screens with operations
predominantly in the United Kingdom and Germany. We have grown our portfolio through a combination
of new cinema developments and acquisitions of cinemas in the United Kingdom and internationally. We
currently operate 115 cinemas with 1,072 screens located across six countries. In addition, we have
recently entered into an agreement to acquire Multikino, the second-largest cinema operator in Poland
by number of screens. After the completion of the Multikino Acquisition, we will operate 145 cinemas
with 1,318 screens located across nine countries.

We believe our cinema portfolio in the United Kingdom represents the newest, most modern chain of
cinemas in the country. In the United Kingdom, 98% of our cinemas are multiplexes, 94% have stadium
seating and all are fully digital. We also recently completed the acquisition of Apollo in the United
Kingdom to strengthen our position in the United Kingdom and to take advantage of certain economies
of scale. After disposing of five cinemas with 27 screens, the Apollo acquisition added nine cinemas with
56 screens to our portfolio, all of which have stadium seating and are fully digital, modern multiplexes. In
the United Kingdom, all of our cinemas use Sony Digital Cinema 4K digital projection technology, which
provides eight times the resolution of 2K digital projectors. We have a broad reach in the United Kingdom
and we estimate that over 60% of the population lives within a 30-minute drive of a Vue cinema.
According to Rentrak/EDI, our gross box office revenue (‘‘GBOR’’) market share in the United Kingdom
was approximately 24% for the year ended December 31, 2012. We operate six of the top 20 grossing
box office cinemas in the United Kingdom, with a strong presence in the key London and West End
markets, including our Westfield London site which was the highest grossing box office cinema in the
United Kingdom for the 53 weeks ended April 4, 2013.

We have leveraged our strong operational knowledge and experience with successful integrations of
acquisitions, primarily in the United Kingdom, to enter new European markets through selective strategic
acquisitions of leading cinema operators. These European markets are generally more fragmented and
less developed than the United Kingdom and we believe they offer opportunities for consolidation and
growth. In August 2012, we established our presence in Germany and Denmark through the acquisition
of CinemaxX, Germany’s second largest cinema operator by number of screens. Our cinemas in
Germany are typically situated in premium city center locations within the 20 largest German cities where
population densities are highest. We believe that all of our German cinemas offer state-of-the-art facilities
and, after completion of our digital rollout program by the end of July 2013, all of our cinemas in
Germany will have 4K digital projection technology. We also are seeking to expand into Poland, Latvia
and Lithuania through the acquisition of Poland’s second largest cinema operator by number of screens,
Multikino. Approximately 97% of Multikino’s cinemas are multiplexes and all are fully digital. In addition,
we operate a 14-screen cinema in Dublin, Ireland, a 9-screen cinema in Faro, Portugal and a 16-screen
cinema in Taipei, Taiwan, each of which is a multiplex cinema and has stadium seating.

On a pro forma basis, assuming the CinemaxX Acquisition and Multikino Acquisition had occurred on
April 5, 2012, our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA for the 53 weeks ended April 4, 2013 would have been
£588.0 million and £110.3 million, respectively. In addition, we would have had approximately
67.1 million admissions to our cinemas. See ‘‘Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information.’’

**Our Competitive Strengths**

We believe the following competitive strengths position us strongly in our markets:

**_A Leading Market Position in Highly Attractive European Markets_**

We believe we are Europe’s second largest cinema operator by number of screens. Upon completion of
the Multikino Acquisition, we will operate in nine countries and will be the only major cinema operator
with a market leading presence in both Western and Eastern Europe, which we believe positions us to
take advantage of the stability of markets in Western Europe while also offering the ability to capitalize on
growing markets in Eastern Europe. The majority of our cinemas are located in the United Kingdom and
Germany, which are the largest and third largest cinema markets in Europe by GBOR, respectively. We
are one of the top three cinema operators in the United Kingdom by GBOR and one of the top two
cinema operators in Germany as measured by number of screens. According to Dodona Research, in
the United Kingdom, total market GBOR grew from approximately £944 million in 2009 to approximately
£1,099 million in 2012 and in Germany total market GBOR grew from approximately e976 million in 2009
to approximately e963 million in 2012. In Poland, Multikino is the second largest cinema operator as
measured by number of screens. In Poland, total GBOR grew from approximately PLN 681 million in
2009 to approximately PLN 711 million in 2012 according to Dodona Research. We believe these
markets should continue to grow and provide opportunities for increasing our revenue.

Our operations in multiple attractive European markets provide us with certain economies of scale and
the benefits of operating leverage across markets. We believe our multi-territory presence across select
attractive markets mitigates film revenue fluctuations and improves our negotiating position with our key
commercial counterparties, including film distributors, concessions suppliers, landlords, technology
providers and advertisers who we believe consider us a valuable and important partner. We believe that
our established relationships have enabled us to secure commercially attractive contract terms with
leading international suppliers. For example, we recently extended our relationship with Sony Digital
Cinema outside of the United Kingdom to Germany and Denmark, where they will be providing their 4K
digital technology to our CinemaxX cinemas. We believe we are now Sony Digital Cinema’s largest
customer outside of the United States. We believe the available choices, flexibility and caliber of our
commercial partners enhance our consumer offering, brand image and positioning.

**_Conveniently Located, High Quality Venues and Modern, State-of-the-Art Cinema Facilities_**

We believe our cinemas are well-located to maximize potential admissions. For example, we estimate
that over 60% of the population in the United Kingdom lives within a 30-minute drive of a Vue cinema. We
also have cinemas in the United Kingdom that are situated in flagship commercial locations with high
foot fall, such as Westfield London, Westfield Stratford City and Leicester Square. In Germany, our
cinemas are typically situated in premium city center locations within the 20 largest German cities where
population densities are highest.

We believe that we operate one of the most modern and technologically advanced cinema portfolios in
Europe. In the United Kingdom, 98% of our cinemas are multiplexes, which allows for greater film
flexibility in terms of time, format and selection and provides certain cost efficiencies as employee
staffing per screen in multiplexes is typically lower as compared with non-multiplex cinemas. In the
United Kingdom, 94% of our screens have stadium seating, which provides unobstructed views of the
screen, and all of our cinemas are fully digital, which provides consistent presentation quality to
customers and greater flexibility in terms of content for cinema operators. Across the Group, following
the completion of the Multikino Acquisition, 97% of our cinemas will be multiplexes and 94% of our
cinemas will have stadium seating. In addition, we believe that the average age of our cinemas in the
United Kingdom is lower than that of our primary competitors. In Germany, we have continued to invest
in refurbishment in recent years and plan to complete the process of upgrading all of our German
cinemas to 4K digital projection technology by the end of July 2013. In the United Kingdom, we also
have developed a proprietary super-sized screen format, Vue Xtreme, which allows us to show largescreen content without paying royalties and licensing fees for alternative branded large-screen
technology.

**_Proven Operational Excellence_**

We apply a rigorous and analytical approach to our cinema operations where we focus on revenue
enhancement and cost optimization. For example, we constantly review our ticket pricing structure and

2


-----

believe we have been able to increase our box office revenue in our cinemas in the United Kingdom
through recent changes to our pricing strategy, such as the introduction of ‘‘peak’’ and ‘‘off-peak’’
pricing and the introduction of our ‘‘Super Saver Tuesday’’ offer. Our pricing strategy also entails
increasing pricing flexibility by cinema location based on variables including time of day, day of the week
and type of customer for each film, resulting in ticket price increases in certain circumstances and in
increased use of discounts in others. We aim to maximize revenue by offering premium propositions,
such as VIP seating in the United Kingdom or differentiated costs by seating location in Germany, for
customer segments that value these elements while selectively using discounts, such as ‘‘Kids AM’’ to
drive admissions volume. These strategies have positively impacted our average ticket price. We also
analyze film scheduling in order to deliver the ‘‘right’’ film, on the ‘‘right’’ screen at the ‘‘right’’ time in
order to achieve optimal attendance. Film scheduling changes have been systematically tested and
have driven increases in our admissions and box office revenue while decreasing variable staff costs as
compared to a control group of our cinemas.

We also improved our cost structure by applying best practices across our cinemas. For example, we
have applied a disciplined approach to our cost components by employing competitive tendering
processes, for both capital expenditures and for supply costs. We also seek to manage our staff costs in
order to match, to the extent possible, staffing levels with admissions levels. We also renegotiate our
lease costs where possible and have invested in energy savings initiatives to reduce electricity and other
utility costs across our cinemas. We have also optimized costs by leveraging our pan-European platform
to establish strong relationships with key suppliers such as Sony Digital Cinema.

Additionally, for the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012, our capital expenditures (net of landlord
contributions) were £21.7 million, which includes CinemaxX and Apollo following their acquisitions, but
excludes Multikino. We expect capital expenditures in 2013 and 2014 to be less than £40 million per
annum (net of landlord contributions, including the full-year effect of CinemaxX and Apollo and including
Multikino). We believe that a significant portion of our capital expenditure investments is discretionary.

**_Track Record of Profitable Growth_**

We have grown our cinema portfolio through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions across
geographies. Since November 2005, we have developed 17 new cinemas with 165 screens in the United
Kingdom. We believe we have been able to maximize operating results in terms of total admissions,
average ticket price, concession spend per person and return on investment by strategically selecting
the ‘‘right’’ place, building the ‘‘right’’ size and paying the ‘‘right’’ rent for our new builds. For example,
our new cinemas range from Vue Stratford City in London, which is a 17-screen, 63,500 square-foot,
state-of-the-art multiplex as part of an approximately £1.5 billion commercial development project for the
2012 London Olympics, to Vue Halifax, which is a 9-screen, 27,100 square-foot cinema located within an
approximately £55 million mixed use development project in Halifax town center. As a result of this
rigorous approach to capital expenditure, since 2006, we have progressively reduced the average
number of years to pay back our initial investment in new cinema developments.

We believe we have grown our GBOR market share in the United Kingdom faster than our primary
competitors over the last five years. Further, we believe that in the United Kingdom as a result of the
quality of our cinemas and our focus on efficient utilization of our screens and the timing and placement
of films, we have on average over the last five years earned higher GBOR per screen than our primary
competitors.

We believe we have extensive experience and a successful track record of value accretive acquisitions.
These acquisitions have allowed us to consolidate in our existing markets and expand into new markets
in Europe that are attractive because they remain fragmented and have significant growth potential. We
believe our selective and disciplined approach has resulted in tangible operating performance gains for
our acquisitions. Target acquisitions need to demonstrate clear financial and strategic logic in terms of

3

payback targets and investment hurdles, and a potential for operational improvement and accelerated
growth. The table below summarizes our acquisitions since 2003.

**_Attractive Business Model with Strong Revenue and Cash Generation Capabilities_**

We believe our business model is attractive with strong revenue and cash generation capabilities due to
our critical position in the film distribution chain and the film industry’s historic resilience. Cinema
operators are an integral component of revenue generation for film distributors. According to the British
Film Institute 2012 Statistical Yearbook, approximately 26% of a film’s total revenue in the United
Kingdom is earned in cinemas. According to the Cinema Exhibitors’ Association, in the United Kingdom,
the amount of time a film is exclusively licensed for cinematic display prior to licensing for other
distribution channels has generally stabilized over the last five years leading to a more stable and
predictable revenue stream. Furthermore, a successful cinema release supports a film’s revenue
generation in channels after its initial theatrical release, such as DVD, Blu-ray, pay-per-view and cable.

We believe attending the cinema remains one of the most popular and affordable out-of-home
entertainment options for consumers. The market has been relatively resilient even during economic
downturns. For example, based on GDP data from the IMF and GBOR data from the Cinema Exhibitors’
Association and the Germany Federal Film Board, as real GDP decreased in the United Kingdom and
Germany, respectively, between 2007 and 2009, GBOR increased over the same period in both these
markets. We believe our conveniently located, state-of-the art cinemas, as well as our strong market
positions in the United Kingdom and Germany, have enabled us to maintain stable and consistent cash
flows. In addition, we offer premium propositions to customers, such as VIP seating, 3D and our supersized screen format, Vue Xtreme, to generate revenue, while selectively using discounts to drive
admissions volume. As a result, our average admissions levels and average ticket prices have remained
relatively stable, including during the most recent economic downturn.

We believe our attractive business model has resulted in strong revenue and cash flow generation. We
also have a history of delevering. After both the management buyout backed by Bank of Scotland
Integrated Finance in 2006 and our acquisition in 2010 by Doughty Hanson, we maintained strong cash
flow generation and were able to successfully delever our capital structure.

**_Experienced Founder-led Senior Management Supported by Committed Shareholders_**

We were founded by our CEO, Tim Richards, in 1998 who was joined by our deputy CEO and CFO, Alan
McNair, in 1999 and our COO, Steve Knibbs, in 2003. This senior management team has over 80 years of
combined experience in the film industry and has grown the Company from six cinemas at the end of
2002 to 145 cinemas, upon the completion of the Multikino Acquisition. This team has also successfully
integrated over 23 newly developed sites and 130 acquired sites since the founding of the Company.
Our senior management remains significantly invested in the company and has reinvested at each stage
of ownership change. We also expect to derive further benefit from the experience and financial support
of OMERS and AIMCo, two of the largest and most experienced institutional investors in Canada, who
both have extensive operational experience in Europe and North America.

**Our Strategy**

**_Continue to Focus on Operational Discipline and Excellence Across our Cinema Portfolio_**

We have emphasized data-driven analytical rigor throughout our organization, and intend to continue to
do so, in order to make sound, evidence-based, informed decisions at all levels. We believe this has
been a key strength in the past and we plan to continue to extend these best-practices to our acquired
cinemas in Germany, Denmark, and upon completion of the Multikino Acquisition, Poland, Latvia and
Lithuania.

We will continue to focus on our operational strengths where historically we have been successful. For
example, in 2012, in order to improve film scheduling, we analyzed and identified key drivers and
conducted controlled scheduling trials at 24 cinemas in the United Kingdom for nine weeks. As a result,
we were able to implement strategic changes that increased admissions and revenue at these cinemas
while decreasing variable staff costs. We then rolled out these strategies throughout our United Kingdom
cinemas and plan to do the same across our cinema portfolio to deliver the ‘‘right’’ film, on the ‘‘right’’
screen, at the ‘‘right’’ time. We believe this approach to film scheduling should allow us to continue to
increase film revenue across all of our operations. We also intend to continue to focus on improving our
pricing strategy by increasing pricing flexibility to provide greater options for our customers and to
expand upon certain premium propositions, such as adding VIP seating in Germany.

We also intend to continue to apply a disciplined approach to all of our cost components. We have
controlled our costs through a combination of competitive tendering processes, for both capital
expenditures and for supply costs, which we intend to apply across our entire cinema portfolio. We also
plan to continue our flexible staffing strategy to adjust employee-related costs in response to variations
in admissions levels and to continue to invest in energy savings initiatives to reduce electricity and other
utility costs across our cinemas. We also plan to renegotiate lease terms to reduce rental costs where
possible. We believe we can continue to apply these costs strategies across our historical cinema
portfolio and implement these practices across our acquired cinemas. We also intend to continue to
incentivize certain managers and staff with bonuses based on profitability.

**_Pursue Growth Opportunities_**

We are focused on cash flow maximization and enhancing our industry leadership. We plan to pursue
growth opportunities from our existing cinemas by attracting new customers and maximizing revenue
from existing customers, opening new cinemas in the near term, as well as continue to evaluate and
pursue selective acquisitions.

We seek to provide a wide range of customer propositions from value offers to premium offers in order to
both attract new customers and maximize revenue from existing customers. We plan to continue to
deliver an innovative cinema experience, with packaged, branded and tailored offerings supported by
high quality standards that drive and protect revenue streams. For example, in the United Kingdom, we
have ‘‘Kids AM’’ for children as well as ‘‘Over 18s Screenings’’ for adults. We also intend to screen film
and alternative content to improve utilization generally in periods of low film demand and to provide
unique content offerings for customers, such as opera, concerts, ballet and sporting events at premium
pricing levels.

We believe a key component in customer choice is cinema location and our new cinema openings are
tailored for their specific catchment requirements. For example, we seek to develop cinemas in areas
with complementary services, such as in retail malls with restaurants and other leisure activities or in
areas with access to car parks. We actively monitor new cinema developments and maintain a shortlist
of potential locations. We intend to continue to apply rigorous analytics of local catchment population,
propensity to visit the cinema, income levels and local competition to ensure each cinema’s
configuration closely matches market capacity of the catchment area. We also believe that our
experiences managing landmark cinemas, such as Westfield London, Westfield Stratford City and
Leicester Square, and our experience in lease negotiation and capital expenditure control should enable
us to minimize development costs to achieve superior payback periods on new cinemas.

We will continue to seek value-enhancing growth based on disciplined and sustainable strategies,
including the careful evaluation, selection and pursuit of strategic opportunities throughout Europe. As
with our acquisitions in the United Kingdom and Germany, we may seek to acquire cinema operators in
Europe or elsewhere where we believe we can realize attractive returns on investment and generate
significant free cash flow. We believe that certain markets in Europe remain fragmented and with our

5


-----

proven track record of identifying and integrating acquisitions successfully, we are well-placed to take
advantage of strategic opportunities.

**_Provide an Exceptional Cinema Experience Delivered by Friendly and Helpful Cinema Staff_**

We aim to be the first choice for cinema entertainment in our markets. We seek to continue to
differentiate our cinema experience by expanding and improving our customer propositions. In addition
to location and price, we believe that customers also choose cinemas based on the quality of the cinema
experience. We are focused on creating a consistent brand image, synonymous with a state-of-the-art
cinematic experience. We are also focusing on customer satisfaction in terms of ease of booking tickets,
premium viewing options and offering a wide range of concessions.

As the film industry produces franchise blockbusters that take advantage of premium formats such as
3D, we believe we can gain customers with our modern, state-of-the-art stadium-seated cinemas with
digital technology such as Sony Digital Cinema 4K, which differentiates our cinema offering from less
modern cinemas. We plan to continue to provide 3D formats and Vue Xtreme, which has super-sized
screens and enhanced sound systems, as well as completing our digital investment with Sony Digital
Cinema to provide 4K technology to our customers in Germany and Denmark.

We also plan to continue our emphasis on customer choice in terms of pricing, film selection and
amenities. For example, we intend to continue offering in the United Kingdom and across our cinema
portfolio both premium pricing options such as VIP seating where customers can enjoy larger, more
luxurious seating in prime locations in the auditorium, as well as customer discount propositions such as
‘‘Kids AM’’ and ‘‘Super Saver Tuesday’’ in the United Kingdom. In addition, we intend to continue to offer
customer propositions like internet booking and mobile applications that allow customers greater
flexibility and ease in purchasing their tickets.

We plan to continue to emphasize customer satisfaction and focus on training and motivating our
employees to provide an exceptional cinema experience. For example, we have cinema incentive plans
that reward employees based on cinema profitability and customer service standards. We also provide
our cinema employees with a modular training program that covers all aspects of running a cinema,
including cinema management. Additionally, in order to gain critical customer insight, we employ a
number of internal and external sources that provide detailed pictures of customer behavior, trends and
attitudes. Listening to customers and understanding their behavior is core to our ability to deliver
successful new offers, enhance existing offers and to better predict demand in the future. We actively
track customer service metrics to check we are delivering high quality service to our customers with our
friendly and helpful staff. We intend to extend these customer-focused training and tracking initiatives to
our newly acquired cinemas.

**History**

We were founded by our CEO, Tim Richards, in 1998. Tim’s business partner, current deputy CEO and
CFO, Alan McNair joined him in 1999. Both had extensive prior senior management experience in the
industry in the United Kingdom and internationally. The company was set up as Spean Bridge
International Cinemas (‘‘SBC’’) with the support of Boston Ventures, a venture capital fund, and by the
end of 2002, had opened four cinemas in the United Kingdom, one in Portugal and one in Taiwan.

In 2003, SBC acquired Warner Village Cinema’s U.K. circuit, which comprised 36 cinemas with
353 screens. Funds for the acquisition were provided by the existing investor and new investors.
Following this acquisition, SBC changed its name to Vue Entertainment and became the operator of the
second largest cinema chain by number of screens in the United Kingdom. The combined 400-screen
state-of-the-art stadium seating multiplex cinema portfolio including the flagship Leicester Square
cinema was fully rebranded as ‘‘Vue’’ within six months. The Vue portfolio continued to grow both
organically and through a series of acquisitions including the acquisition of Ster Century in 2005, which
at the time operated the highest grossing cinema in the United Kingdom and Ireland at the Liffey Valley
Shopping Centre in Dublin.

In 2006, we completed a management buyout backed by Bank of Scotland Integrated Finance and
simultaneously acquired the five cinemas we had been managing under contract for Village Roadshow.
Between 2006 and the end of 2010, we developed an additional 14 cinemas in the United Kingdom,
adding 133 screens to the portfolio and acquired Hoyts’ 6-screen Wood Green cinema, bringing our
portfolio to 70 cinemas and 679 screens.

-----

Between 2010 to 2011, we achieved several significant milestones including opening two marketleading cinemas in London, our 14-screen cinema at Vue Westfield London in 2010 and our 17-screen
cinema at Vue Westfield Stratford City in 2011, which were the number one and five cinemas,
respectively, in the United Kingdom for the 53 weeks ended April 4, 2013, as measured by GBOR. During
that time, we were acquired by Doughty Hanson at the end of 2010. In 2012, we completed the
acquisition of Apollo in the United Kingdom and CinemaxX in Germany and Denmark. Apollo added nine
cinemas and 56 screens in the United Kingdom after disposal of five cinemas with 27 screens, further
strengthening our position in the United Kingdom. CinemaxX represents our first significant international
acquisition, adding 34 cinemas located in Germany and Denmark to our portfolio. More recently, we
have entered into an agreement to acquire Multikino in Poland, which will make us the only cinema
operator with a market-leading presence across both Western and Eastern Europe.

**Current Trading**

For the 18 weeks ended April 4, 2013, we generated revenue of £186.5 million, EBITDA of £33.7 million
and had total admissions of 19.6 million. Although our full results for the 26 weeks ended May 30, 2013
have not yet been completed, based on our management accounts for the 26 weeks ended May 30,
2013, we expect to report revenue of approximately £263 million and EBITDA of approximately
£48 million (excluding Multikino). In addition, we estimate our total admissions for the 26 weeks ended
May 30, 2013 were 27.5 million (excluding Multikino). These results reflect a relatively slow period in April
across the industry, primarily as a result of a weaker film slate as compared to earlier in the year, followed
by stronger performance in May driven principally by recent releases such as Iron Man 3, Star Trek Into
_Darkness and Fast & Furious 6. We generally have experienced stronger performance in the second half_
of our financial year.

The above preliminary estimates are based on our management accounts which are principally
prepared in accordance with U.K. GAAP, and are not intended to be a comprehensive statement of our
financial or operational results for the 26 weeks ended May 30, 2013. These preliminary estimates were
prepared based on a number of assumptions and judgments and, as a result, reflect a certain level of
uncertainty and are subject to revision. Our actual results for the 26 weeks ended May 30, 2013 may vary
from these preliminary estimates, and such variations could be material. See ‘‘Forward-Looking
_Statements’’ and ‘‘Risk Factors’’ in this offering memorandum for a discussion of various factors which_
could affect our future performance and results of operations.

**Principal Shareholders**

Following the Vue Acquisition, the Issuer will hold all the shares of Vue Entertainment International
Limited. The Issuer is wholly owned indirectly by Holdco, which, following the Vue Acquisition, will be
wholly-owned by the AIMCo Entities, the OMERS Entities, the Executive Managers (and their close

**The Transactions**

**_The Vue Acquisition_**

On June 9, 2013, the Issuer and Holdco entered into the Vue Acquisition Agreement to acquire the entire
issued share capital of Vue Entertainment International Limited, the preference shares of Vue Holdings
(Jersey) Limited and the loan notes issued by Vue Holdings (Jersey) Limited from DH P S.´a r.l, the
Executive Managers and certain other senior management, among others. The completion of the Vue
Acquisition is subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, including antitrust approval by the European
Commission. We submitted our official notification to the European Commission on June 21, 2013. If the
regulatory approval by the European Commission is not received by September 30, 2013, unless
amended, the Vue Acquisition Agreement will terminate. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the
_Transactions—The Vue Acquisition and the Multikino Acquisition are subject to significant uncertainties_
_and there is a risk that the conditions to the escrow will not be satisfied and we will be required to redeem_
_all or certain of the Notes, which means that you may not obtain the return you expect on the Notes.’’_

**_The Multikino Acquisition_**

On May 10, 2013, Eudialyte Company sp. z o.o., an entity indirectly owned by Vue Holdings (Jersey)
Limited, entered into the Multikino Acquisition Agreement to acquire the entire issued share capital of
Multikino S.A. from Multikino Holding B.V. and AP Portico Slask S.A.R.L. The completion of the Multikino
Acquisition is subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, including regulatory approval by the President
of the Polish Competition Authority. An application to the competent antitrust authority in Poland was
submitted on May 16, 2013. If the regulatory approval by the relevant antitrust authority is not received by
December 1, 2013, unless amended, the Multikino Acquisition Agreement will terminate. See ‘‘Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the Guarantees—If the conditions to the escrow are not_
_satisfied, the Issuer will be required to redeem a portion or all of the Notes, which means that you may not_
_obtain the return you expect on the Notes.’’_

**_The Financing_**

The equity consideration for the Vue Acquisition is £210 million and is subject to certain adjustments
specified in the Vue Acquisition Agreement. The equity consideration for the Multikino Acquisition is
e48.0 million (£40.8 million, translated into pounds sterling at an exchange rate of e1.1779 per £1.00 as
at April 4, 2013). If the Multikino Acquisition completes prior to the Vue Acquisition, the Multikino
Acquisition will be funded by Doughty Hanson (the ‘‘DH Multikino Bridge Amount’’) and upon
completion of the Vue Acquisition, a sum equivalent to the DH Multikino Bridge Amount will be paid by
the Issuer to Doughty Hanson pursuant to the terms of the Vue Acquisition Agreement. It is expected that
the Vue Acquisition and the Multikino Acquisition will be financed through:

- the Issuer Share Subscription Amount;

8

- the Issuer Loan;

- the Bridge Loan;

- the proceeds of the Offering; and

- depending on the timing of the Vue Acquisition Completion Date, drawings under the Revolving
Credit Facility.

The proceeds from the financing described above will be used to:

- fund the consideration payable for the entire issued share capital of Vue Entertainment International
Limited;

- fund the consideration payable for the entire issued share capital of Multikino S.A.;

- fund the consideration payable for all the preference shares of Vue Holdings (Jersey) Limited;

- fund the consideration payable for all the loan notes issued by Vue Holdings (Jersey) Limited;

_Release of proceeds from escrow_

Pending the completion of the Vue Acquisition, the gross proceeds of the Offering will be deposited into
the Escrow Accounts in the name of the Issuer but controlled by, and pledged on a first-ranking basis in
favor of the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes, pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. The release
of the escrow proceeds will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The Escrow Agreement
will provide that £499.4 million (or the equivalent) of the proceeds of the Notes will be released upon the
Vue Acquisition Completion Date in order to fund such acquisition and £50.0 million (or the equivalent) of
the proceeds will be released upon the Multikino Acquisition Completion Date, if such date occurs after
the completion of the Vue Acquisition, otherwise the Vue Acquisition Completion Date. See ‘‘Description
_of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.’’ The completion of both_
acquisitions is subject to certain conditions, including regulatory approvals. If the Vue Acquisition is not
completed on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, or upon the occurrence of certain other events, then
all of the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption. If the Multikino Acquisition is not
completed on or prior to (i) the Escrow Longstop Date, if the Vue Acquisition Completion Date has not
yet occurred, or (ii) if the Vue Acquisition Completion Date has occurred, the Extended Escrow Longstop
Date, or upon the occurrence of certain other events, then £50.0 million (or the equivalent) (or such
lesser or greater amount as left in escrow following release in respect of the Vue Acquisition) aggregate
principal amount of the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption. The special mandatory
redemption will be at a price equal to 100% of the issue price of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to the date of the special mandatory
redemption. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.’’

We refer to the Vue Acquisition, the Multikino Acquisition, the Financing, the entering into the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement, the entering into the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement and
the other transactions contemplated thereby, including the repayment of existing indebtedness and
payment of fees and expenses, together, as the ‘‘Transactions.’’ See ‘‘Use of Proceeds,’’ ‘‘Capitalization’’
and ‘‘Description of the Notes.’’

**Sources and Uses**

We expect the gross proceeds from the Offering will be £549.4 million. The gross proceeds will be
deposited into the Escrow Accounts in the name of the Issuer but will be controlled by, and pledged on a

9


-----

first-ranking basis in favor of, the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes, pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement. The release of the escrow proceeds will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.
The Escrow Agreement will provide that £499.4 million (or the equivalent) of the proceeds of the Notes
will be released upon the Vue Acquisition Completion Date and £50.0 million (or the equivalent) of such
proceeds of the Notes will be released upon the Multikino Acquisition Completion Date, if such date
occurs after the Vue Acquisition Completion Date, otherwise the Vue Acquisition Completion Date. See
‘‘Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.’’

The expected estimated sources and uses of the funds necessary to complete the Transactions are
shown in the below table as if they had occurred as at April 4, 2013. Actual amounts will vary from
estimated amounts depending on several factors, including differences from our estimate of existing
cash in the business, our estimates of the cost of repaying the existing indebtedness described below,
differences from our estimates of fees and expenses and the ultimate timing of the Vue Acquisition
Completion Date and the Multikino Acquisition Completion Date.

may draw on the Revolving Credit Facility up to approximately £15.0 million for working capital purposes and may continue
to utilize the Revolving Credit Facility going forward. The Revolving Credit Facility will be secured by first-ranking security
interests over the Collateral, which also secures the Notes and the Guarantees. Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations will be entitled to be repaid from the proceeds from
enforcement in respect of the Collateral before any proceeds will be applied to repay obligations under the Notes. See
‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility.’’

(3) Prior to the completion of the Vue Acquisition and the Multikino Acquisition, the Issuer will not control Vue or Multikino, and
Vue and Multikino will not be subject to the covenants described in the section entitled ‘‘Description of the Notes.’’ See ‘‘Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to the Transaction—The Issuer does not currently control Vue and its subsidiaries or Multikino and will_
_not control Vue and its subsidiaries or Multikino until completion of the Vue Acquisition and the Multikino Acquisition,_
_respectively.’’_

(4) Upon the initial issuance of the Notes, the Notes will solely be senior obligations of the Issuer and will not be obligations of
any Guarantor. No later than the earlier of (a) the date on which such entity becomes a guarantor under the Revolving Credit
Facility and (b) two business days following the Vue Acquisition Completion Date (or 15 business days for Aurora Cinema
(Ireland) Limited), the Initial Vue Guarantors will accede to the Indenture and will guarantee the Notes. In addition, no later
than the earlier of (a) the date on which such entity becomes a guarantor under the Revolving Credit Facility and (b) 30
business days following the later of (x) the Vue Acquisition Completion Date and (y) the Multikino Acquisition Completion
Date, the Multikino Guarantors will accede to the Indenture and will guarantee the Notes.

The Initial Vue Guarantors would have represented 69.7% of Vue’s consolidated turnover and 66.6% of Vue’s EBITDA for the
53 week period ended April 4, 2013, on a U.K. GAAP basis. The CinemaxX Guarantors for the period following their
acquisition, would have represented 21.6% of Vue’s consolidated turnover and 23.8% of Vue’s EBITDA for the 53 week
period ended April 4, 2013. In aggregate, the Initial Vue Guarantors and the CinemaxX Guarantors would have represented
91.3% of Vue’s consolidated turnover and 90.4% of Vue’s EBITDA for the 53 week period ended April 4, 2013. Such
percentages exclude the pre-acquisition results of CinemaxX. The Multikino Guarantors would have represented 83.6% of
Multikino’s consolidated revenue and 93.6% of Multikino’s EBITDA for the twelve month period ended March 31, 2013 on an
IFRS basis.

(5) The Guarantees will be subject to certain limitations under applicable law, as described under ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating
_to the Notes and the Guarantees—Each Guarantee will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by_
_applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability.’’_

(6) From the Issue Date to the Vue Acquisition Completion Date and the Multikino Acquisition Completion Date (if such date
occurs after the Vue Acquisition, otherwise the Vue Acquisition Completion Date), the Notes will be secured by first-ranking
security interests granted on an equal and ratable first-priority basis over the Escrowed Property deposited into the Escrow
Accounts. Prior to or on the Vue Acquisition Completion Date, the Notes will be secured by first-ranking security interests
granted on an equal and ratable first-priority basis over the Vue Closing Collateral. No later than the earlier of (a) the date on
which the Revolving Credit Facility is secured by such Liens over the Post-Closing Vue Collateral and (b) two business days
following the Vue Acquisition Completion Date (or 15 Business Days for Liens granted by Aurora Cinema (Ireland) Limited),
the Notes will be secured by first-ranking security interests granted on an equal and ratable first-priority basis over the PostClosing Vue Collateral. No later than the earlier of (a) the date on which the Revolving Credit Facility is secured by such Liens
over the Multikino Collateral and (b) 30 business days following the later of (x) the Vue Acquisition Completion Date and
(y) the Multikino Acquisition Completion Date, the Notes will be secured by first-ranking security interests granted on an
equal and ratable first-priority basis over the Multikino Collateral. See ‘‘Description of the Notes’’ for further information. The
Collateral that secures the Notes and the Guarantees will also secure the Revolving Credit Facility on a pari passu basis.

(7) As at the Vue Acquisition Completion Date, CinemaxX will not grant security interests in the Collateral or issue Guarantees.
Pursuant to the Indenture, no later than the earlier of (a) the date on which such entity becomes a guarantor under the
Revolving Credit Facility and (b) 20 business days of the occurrence of a Structure Event (as defined in the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement), the CinemaxX Guarantors will grant Security Interests in the assets of CinemaxX and issue Guarantees.
As an Aktiengesellschaft, a stock corporation under German law, CinemaxX is currently restricted in its ability to grant security
interests in the Collateral and issue Guarantees. Before CinemaxX grants Security Interests in the assets of CinemaxX and its
subsidiaries and issues Guarantees, it must be converted into a Gesellschaft mit beschr¨ankter Haftung, a German limited
company. This conversion is subject to registration within the commercial register. The conversion process normally takes up
to three months to complete; however, this conversion can only be initiated once the remaining ordinary shares have been
acquired from the minority shareholders. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—The Squeeze Out could
_take longer than anticipated, which would delay the granting of Security Interests in the assets of CinemaxX and its_
_subsidiaries as well as delay the issuance of the Guarantees by the CinemaxX Guarantors.’’_

**Guarantees . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Issuer’s obligations under the Notes will not be guaranteed

Pursuant to the Indenture, within 20 business days of the
occurrence of a Structure Event (as defined in the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement), the CinemaxX Guarantors will grant
Security Interests in the assets of CinemaxX and issue
Guarantees. As an _Aktiengesellschaft, a stock corporation_

Guarantees. Before CinemaxX grants security interests in the
assets of CinemaxX and its subsidiaries and issues
Guarantees, it must be converted into a _Gesellschaft mit_
_beschr¨ankter Haftung, a German limited company. This_
conversion is subject to registration within the commercial
register. The conversion process normally takes up to three
months to complete; however, this conversion can only be
initiated once the remaining ordinary shares have been
acquired from the minority shareholders. See ‘‘Risk Factors—
_Risks Relating to the Notes and the Guarantees—The Squeeze_
_Out could take longer than anticipated, which would delay the_
_granting of Security Interests in the assets of CinemaxX and its_
_subsidiaries as well as delay the issuance of the Guarantees by_

The validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the
liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations
described in ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the
_Guarantees—Each Guarantee will be subject to certain_
_limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable_
_laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and_
_enforceability’’ and ‘‘Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of_

_the Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law_
_Considerations.’’_

**Ranking of the Guarantees . . . . . .** The Guarantees of each relevant Guarantor will:

                - be a general obligation of that Guarantor;

                - rank _pari passu in right of payment with all existing and_
future obligations of such Guarantor that are not
subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantee,
including its obligations under the Revolving Credit
Facility;

                - rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future
Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is subordinated in
right of payment to such Guarantee; and

                - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future
obligations of the relevant Guarantor that are secured by
property or assets that do not secure such Guarantees, to
the extent of the value of the property and assets securing
such obligations.

The Guarantees will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement and certain restrictions on enforcement of
Collateral, including a 30-day consultation period with lenders
under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. See
‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement.’’_

The Guarantees will be subject to release under certain
circumstances, including an automatic release of the
Guarantee of any Guarantor to the extent such Subsidiary is
sold by the Security Agent pursuant to an enforcement action.
See ‘‘Description of the Notes—The Guarantees—Release of
_the Guarantees.’’_

Date and the Multikino Acquisition Completion Date (if such

equal and ratable first-priority basis over the Escrowed
Property deposited into the Escrow Accounts controlled by,
and pledged in favor of the Trustee on behalf of the holders of
the Notes, pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.

Prior to or on the Vue Acquisition Completion Date, the Notes

the following Collateral:

                - the shares of the Issuer granted by Vougeot Midco
Limited;

                - certain receivables in respect of intercompany loans

conversion is subject to registration within the commercial
register. The conversion process normally takes up to three
months to complete; however, this conversion can only be
initiated once the remaining ordinary shares have been
acquired from the minority shareholders. See ‘‘Risk Factors—
_Risks Relating to the Notes and the Guarantees—The Squeeze_
_Out could take longer than anticipated, which would delay the_
_granting of Security Interests in the assets of CinemaxX and its_
_subsidiaries as well as delay the issuance of the Guarantees by_

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the lenders under the
Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedge counterparties will
be repaid with the proceeds from any enforcement of the
Collateral in priority to the Notes. See ‘‘Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.’’_

**Escrow of Proceeds; Special**
**Mandatory Redemption . . . . . . . . .** The gross proceeds from the Offering will be deposited into the
Escrow Accounts in the name of the Issuer but controlled by,
and pledged in favor of the Trustee on behalf of the holders of
the Notes, pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. The release of
the escrow proceeds will be subject to the satisfaction of
certain conditions. The Escrow Agreement will provide that
£499.4 million (or the equivalent) of the proceeds of the Notes
will be released upon the Vue Acquisition Completion Date in
order to fund such acquisition and £50.0 million (or the
equivalent) of the proceeds will be released upon the Multikino
Acquisition Completion Date (if such date occurs after the date

Acquisition Completion Date).

All of the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory
redemption if (a) the Vue Acquisition Completion Date does not
take place on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date; (b) there
occurs a repudiation by the Issuer of any of its obligations
under the Escrow Agreement or the unenforceability of the
Escrow Agreement against the Issuer for any reason; (c) in the
reasonable judgment of the Issuer, the Vue Acquisition will not
be completed by the Escrow Longstop Date; (d) any of the

18


-----

conditions set forth under the first paragraph of the caption
‘‘Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special
_Mandatory Redemption—Vue Acquisition Escrow Release’’_
become incapable of being satisfied on or prior to the Escrow
Longstop Date; or (e) certain events of defaults arise as
described under the caption ‘‘Description of the Notes—Events
_of Default and Remedies,’’ in each case, on or prior to the_
Escrow Longstop Date.

In addition, £50.0 million (or the equivalent) (or such lesser or
greater amount as left in escrow following release in respect of
the Vue Acquisition as set forth above) aggregate principal
amount of the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory
redemption if (a) the Multikino Acquisition Completion Date
does not take place on or prior to December 1, 2013 (the
‘‘Extended Escrow Longstop Date’’); (b) there occurs a
repudiation by the Issuer of any of its obligations under the
Escrow Agreement or the unenforceability of the Escrow
Agreement against the Issuer for any reason; (c) in the
reasonable judgment of the Issuer, the Multikino Acquisition
will not be completed by the Escrow Longstop Date or the
Extended Escrow Longstop Date, as the case may be; (d) any
of the conditions set forth under the first paragraph of the
caption ‘‘Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds;
_Special Mandatory Redemption—Multikino Acquisition Escrow_
_Release’’ become incapable of being satisfied on or prior to the_
Escrow Longstop Date or the Extended Escrow Longstop
Date, as the case may be; or (e) certain events of defaults arise
as described under the caption ‘‘Description of the Notes—
_Events of Default and Remedies,’’ in each case, on or prior to_
the Extended Escrow Longstop Date.

mandatory redemption. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—
_Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.’’_

**Additional Amounts . . . . . . . . . . . .** All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer under or with
respect to the Notes, or any Guarantor with respect to its
Guarantee, will be made without withholding or deduction for,
or on account of, any present or future taxes unless required by
applicable law. If withholding or deduction for such taxes is
required to be made in any relevant taxing jurisdiction under or
with respect to a payment on the Notes or the Guarantees,
subject to certain exceptions, the Issuer or the relevant
Guarantor, as the case may be, will pay the Additional Amounts
necessary so that the net amount received by the holders of
Notes after the withholding or deduction is not less than the
amount that they would have received in the absence of the
withholding or deduction. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—
_Additional Amounts.’’_

(8) EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, EBITDAR and Adjusted EBITDAR are supplemental measures of our
financial and operating performance used by management that are not required by, or prepared in accordance with,
U.K. GAAP or IFRS. These measures are prepared by management because we believe they provide a view of our recurring
operating performance that is unaffected by our capital structure and allows management to readily view operating trends
and identify strategies to improve operating performance. Our use of each of these measures is as follows:

  - We define EBITDA as our consolidated loss on ordinary activities before taxation, adjusted for interest receivable and
similar income, interest payable and similar charges, depreciation and amortization.

  - We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, adjusted to remove the effect of certain non-recurring or non-cash items which
we believe are not indicative of our underlying operating performance.

  - We define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of turnover.

  - We define EBITDAR as EBITDA, adjusted for rent expense (including turnover rent and rent-free adjustments).

  - We define Adjusted EBITDAR as Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted for rent expense (including turnover rent and rent-free
adjustments).

The EBITDA measures presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. We
encourage you to review our financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure. See
‘‘Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Other Financial Measures’’ for an explanation of certain limitations to the
use of these measures.

**Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information**

The unaudited pro forma combined financial information has been derived from the Consolidated
Financial Statements, the consolidated financial statements of Multikino, the pre-acquisition
consolidated financial information of CinemaxX for the period April 1, 2012 to July 31, 2012, adjusted to
give effect to (i) IFRS to U.K. GAAP differences, (ii) the Vue Acquisition, (iii) the Multikino Acquisition,
(iv) the Financing, and the application of the proceeds therefrom; and are prepared in accordance with
the basis of preparation as described in the notes to the unaudited pro forma combined financial
information. For purposes of this unaudited pro forma combined financial information, the Transactions
are deemed to have occurred on April 4, 2013.

The assumptions underlying the above pro forma adjustments are described in the notes presented in
‘‘Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information,’’ which should be read in conjunction with the
unaudited pro forma combined financial information. Both the Vue Acquisition and Multikino Acquisition
will be accounted for by using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires determination of the
fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the closing date of each acquisition, and allocation of
the purchase price based on such fair values. As of the date of this offering memorandum, in respect of
the Vue Acquisition and the Multikino Acquisition, we have not performed the valuation studies
necessary to estimate the fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the
related allocation of the purchase price. The purchase price allocation in respect of the Vue Acquisition
and the Multikino Acquisition may result in significant adjustments to the historical values of property,
plant and equipment and intangible assets and other assets, liabilities and provisions, resulting in a
significant increase in depreciation and amortization expense. Refer to ‘‘Unaudited Pro Forma Combined
_Financial Information,’’ Note 1(e) to the unaudited pro forma combined income statement and Note 2(b)_
to the unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet for a further discussion of the purchase price
allocation and its impact on our financial position and results.

The unaudited pro forma combined financial information below has not been prepared in accordance
with Regulation S-X of the Securities Act, the Prospectus Directive or generally accepted accounting
standards.

The unaudited pro forma combined financial information is for informational purposes only and should
not be considered indicative of actual results that would have been achieved had the Transactions been
completed on the dates indicated and do not purport to indicate our future consolidated results of
operations or financial position.

The unaudited pro forma combined financial information should be read in conjunction with the
information contained in ‘‘Selected Historical Financial Information,’’ ‘‘Management’s Discussion and
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,’’ the Consolidated Financial Statements, the_
consolidated financial statements of Multikino, the consolidated financial statements of CinemaxX and
the unaudited pro forma combined financial information and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves certain risks. You should carefully consider the risks described below_
_as well as the other information contained in this offering memorandum before making an investment_
_decision. Any of the following risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of_
_operations or financial condition and as a result, you may lose all or part of your original investment._
_Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also_
_have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition._

**Risks Relating to Our Business and the Industry**

**_We depend on film production and performance._**

Our ability to operate successfully depends upon the availability, diversity, appeal and commercial
success of films and on our ability to license films on favorable terms. We mostly license first-run films,
the success of which depends in part on the marketing efforts of the major film studios. Poor box office
performance or any disruption in film production, including by reason of a strike or a reduction in the
marketing efforts of the major film studios, could adversely affect our business by resulting in fewer
customers interested in the films we exhibit and reduced revenue. Conversely, the successful
performance of films, particularly the sustained success of any one film may generate positive results for
us during a specific fiscal period or year that may not necessarily be indicative of, or comparable to, our
future results of operations. A change in the type and breadth of films offered by film studios, including
whether 3D films are produced in the future, may also adversely affect cinema admissions and revenue.
In addition, premium pricing on ticket sales including for 3D films, VIP seating and for premium screens
such as our super-sized screen format Vue Xtreme, has become an important source of revenue for our
cinemas. There can be no assurance that 3D films will continue in popularity, as customers may not
continue to perceive that the value of viewing a film in 3D outweighs the incremental cost, or that we will
be able to maintain a VIP seating or premium screen pricing strategy.

**_We have no control over distributors of films and our business, results of operations and financial_**
**_condition may be materially adversely affected if our access to films is limited or delayed._**

We rely on distributors of films, over whom we have no control, for the films that we exhibit. Film
distributors license films to cinema operators, including us, on a film-by-film and cinema-by-cinema
basis. Consequently, we cannot guarantee a supply of films by entering into long-term arrangements
with major film distributors, but must discuss and agree supply on a film-by-film basis. The cost of each
film, the date we can debut each film at our cinemas and the date we must stop running each film are
subject to the agreement we are able to negotiate with each film distributor. Furthermore, film distributors
determine the timing of releases, which may either result in limited content during certain periods, or the
commercial underperformance of individual films as a result of other competing films being released or
other events being held during the same period. These factors have had and may continue to have the
ability to impact our results of operations during specific reporting periods. We may not be able to
negotiate favorable terms or reach an agreement on terms for the exhibition of films, including films that
are expected to be popular across a wide range of audiences.

The film distribution business is highly concentrated and dominated by the major Hollywood film
studios, with a number of smaller film distributors also operating in the markets in which we have a
presence. Our business particularly depends on maintaining good relations with these major film
distributors, as this affects our ability to negotiate commercially favorable terms for first-run films. Our
business also depends on smaller film distributors including those that distribute locally produced
content in our markets, particularly in Germany and, assuming completion of the Multikino Acquisition,
in Poland. Our business may be adversely affected if our access to films is limited or delayed because of
deterioration in our relationships with one or more film distributors or for some other reason. To the
extent that we are unable to license a popular film for exhibition in our cinemas or on favorable terms, our
business, results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affected.

**_We are subject to intense competition and if we are unable to compete with our competitors for any_**
**_of the below or other reasons, our business, results of operation or financial condition may be_**
**_materially adversely affected._**

Our cinemas are subject to varying degrees of competition in the geographic areas in which we operate.
Competitors may be national, regional or independent cinema operators and may have more resources

34


-----

with which to compete. In the United Kingdom, we operate in a relatively consolidated market with two
primary competitors, Cineworld and Odeon. In contrast, the German cinema market is more
fragmented, with the top three market players, Cinestar, CinemaxX and UCI Kinowelt, comprising in total
less than a quarter of screens in 2012. Similar to the United Kingdom market, the Polish market is
relatively consolidated with the three significant market players, Cinema City, Multikino and Helios,
operating the majority of multiplexes. We also compete with other, smaller multiplex operators and
independent operators across our markets.

Competition among cinema companies is often intense with respect to the following factors:

_Attracting customers:_ The competition for customers is dependent upon factors such as the location
(including the size and demographics of the catchment area) and number of cinemas, screens and
seating capacity in a given market, the type of screens (including 3D or super-sized screens equivalent
to our Vue Xtreme screens), pricing, the popularity of films screened, film showtime availability, customer
service quality and the comfort and quality of the cinemas, including quality of projection and sound
equipment. Our competitors have sought to increase the number of screens that they operate, program
films differently or use pricing or promotions to attract customers away from our cinemas.

_Acquiring attractive cinema sites:_ We compete with other cinema operators and other businesses in
our efforts to locate and acquire attractive sites for our cinemas. Competitors have built or may be
planning to build cinemas in certain areas where we operate, which could result in excess capacity and
increased competition for customers. Competition for new and desirable sites is intense and we cannot
prevent competing cinema operators from opening cinemas that may reduce our attendance levels.

_Acquiring cinemas:_ We also anticipate significant competition from other cinema operators and
financial buyers when trying to acquire cinemas, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to
acquire such cinemas at reasonable prices or on favorable terms. Moreover, some of these possible
buyers may be stronger financially than we are. In addition, given our size and geographical presence,
we may be required by competition regulatory authorities to dispose of cinemas in connection with any
future acquisitions that we make. As a result of the foregoing, we may not succeed in acquiring cinemas
or may have to purchase cinemas on comparatively unfavorable terms.

_Licensing films:_ We believe that the principal competitive factors with respect to film licensing include
licensing terms, number of screens available for a particular picture, revenue potential, the location and
condition of an operator’s cinemas and demographics. Cinema operators with operations in more
markets than us may be able to leverage their scale to obtain more favorable terms than those which we
can obtain.

If we are unable to compete with our competitors for any of the above or other reasons, our business,
results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affected. For further information,
see ‘‘Business—Our Markets and Competition.’’

**_An increase in other forms of entertainment, the use of alternative film delivery methods or piracy_**
**_of films may drive down our admissions and reduce our ticket prices._**

We compete for the public’s leisure time and disposable income with other forms of entertainment,
including sporting events, music concerts, theater, restaurants and family leisure attractions, such as
theme parks. If these activities improve in value, frequency or attractiveness, the share of the public’s
leisure time and disposable income spent at the cinema may decrease and, as a result, our admissions
and revenue from ticket sales may be negatively impacted, especially in years with high-profile sporting
and other public events. For example, in 2012, our results of operations during the summer season were
adversely impacted by the London Olympics.

We also compete with other film delivery methods, including network, rental, cable and satellite
television, in-home television (2D and 3D), DVDs and Blu-ray, video-on-demand, pay-per-view services,
streaming and downloads via the Internet. Competition from Internet downloads may increase as
broadband technology improves and downloading speeds increase and if the window between a film’s
exclusive release in cinemas to its release in alternative delivery formats shortens or becomes
non-existent.

An increase in the popularity of these alternative film delivery methods and other forms of entertainment
could reduce admissions at our cinemas, limit the prices we can charge for admission and materially
adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

35


-----

In addition, an increase in the availability or popularity of pirated films may result in film studios reducing
their investment in films, resulting in the release of fewer films and lower quality films with less
commercial appeal or the use of alternative delivery channels such as digital downloads, which could
adversely affect our admissions and, as a result, our business, results of operations or financial
condition.

**_Our results of operations fluctuate as a result of the timing and quality of film releases, variations in_**
**_weather conditions and other factors._**

Our results of operations have historically fluctuated with the timing of releases of films by the major film
distributors. Generally, the most commercially successful films have been released during holiday
periods, especially the summer and around the Christmas holidays. The unexpected emergence of a
commercially successful film during other periods or the failure of an expected success at a key time
could alter this trend. The timing of film releases can have a significant effect on our results of operations,
and the results of one period are not necessarily indicative of results for the next period or for the same
period in the following year.

We expect fluctuations due to the variable nature of film production and release, but unexpected events
can have a significant impact on our cash flow, as we are subject to events beyond our control, such as
distribution release schedules, weather conditions and competing events.

Title-by-title success of films at the box office can be highly unpredictable. Unexpected results may
disrupt our projected cash flow significantly.

In addition, certain weather conditions or forecasts can reduce significantly the number of people who
go to the cinema. During times of extreme weather conditions, such as winter snow storms or summer
heat waves, the number of people who decide to go to the cinema could reduce significantly. For
example, the United Kingdom experienced unusual weather patterns during the course of our 2011
financial year which adversely impacted our admissions and revenue.

Our business may also be affected by social, political, cultural or other events. For example, the rioting
which took place in London and other United Kingdom cities in the summer of 2011 led to lower
admissions and revenue than we have historically experienced during the summer period. Road
closures or the reduced availability of public transport also has the ability to adversely impact
admissions.

**_Acquiring or expanding existing cinemas may require additional financing, and we cannot be_**
**_certain that we will be able to obtain new financing on favorable terms, or at all._**

Our capital expenditures (net of landlord contributions) were £21.7 million for our 2012 financial year. In
our financial year 2013 and 2014, we expect our capital expenditures will be less than £40 million per
annum (net of landlord contributions including the full-year effect of CinemaxX and Apollo and including
Multikino). Actual capital expenditures may differ materially from our estimates. We may have to seek
additional financing or issue additional securities to fully implement our growth strategy. We cannot be
certain that we will be able to obtain new financing, including debt financing in the credit markets, on
favorable terms, or at all. In addition, covenants under our existing indebtedness may limit our ability to
incur additional indebtedness, and the performance of any additional cinemas may not be sufficient to
service the related indebtedness that we are permitted to incur.

**_We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our current or potential acquisitions._**

We have acquired cinemas in the United Kingdom, Germany and Denmark and, assuming the
completion of the Multikino Acquisition, will have acquired cinemas in Poland, Latvia and Lithuania. A
component of our overall strategy is careful evaluation, selection and pursuit of strategic opportunities
throughout Europe, including acquisition of cinema operators. In any acquisition, we expect to benefit
from operational improvements and cost savings through, for example, the rollout of our best practices
to our acquired cinemas and the increased leverage in supplier negotiations that typically arises from
increased size. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow
from these acquisitions to service any indebtedness incurred to finance such acquisitions or realize any
other anticipated benefits. Nor can there be any assurance that our profitability will be improved by any
one or more acquisitions or that the benefits that we anticipate from these acquisitions will be realized.

36


-----

As we seek to grow our portfolio of cinemas, competition regulators may prevent us from acquiring
businesses or place conditions or constraints on potential acquisitions which would result in a lost
opportunity or a significantly less advantageous opportunity. For example, in connection with our
acquisition of Apollo in the United Kingdom, the competition authority required us to dispose of four
cinemas with 24 screens. Currently, we are seeking the approval of the President of the Polish
Competition Authority to complete the Multikino Acquisition and regulatory approval from the European
Commission in connection with the Vue Acquisition, and we cannot assure you that we will receive such
approvals on a timely basis and on what terms, or at all. Additionally, the acquisition and subsequent
integration of a new cinema chain is a complex and time consuming process and may divert
management attention and resources away from other activities. Failure to manage growth effectively
could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_We may not be able to integrate effectively any cinemas we acquire or successfully implement_**
**_appropriate operational, financial and management systems and controls to achieve the benefits_**
**_expected to result from such acquisitions._**

Our ability to integrate and manage acquired businesses effectively, such as in respect of the proposed
Multikino Acquisition, and to handle any future growth will depend upon a number of factors including
the size of the acquired businesses, the quality of the acquired management, the nature and
geographical locations of their operations, and the resulting complexity of integrating their operations.
Our relationship with current employees or employees of any acquired business may become impaired.
We may also be subject to unexpected claims and liabilities arising from such acquisitions. These claims
and liabilities could be costly to defend, could be material to our financial position and might exceed
either the limitations of any applicable indemnification provisions or the financial resources of the
indemnifying parties. Although we try to investigate each business thoroughly prior to an acquisition and
obtain appropriate representations and warranties as to its assets and liabilities, there can be no
assurance that we will be able to assess ongoing profitability and identify all actual or potential liabilities
of a business prior to its acquisition. If we acquire businesses or assets which result in assuming
unforeseen liabilities in respect of which we have not obtained contractual protections or for which
protection is not available, this could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or
financial condition.

**_We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of and may experience construction risk on new_**
**_cinema builds._**

We are actively seeking to grow our portfolio of cinemas through new cinema construction. Since
November 2005, we have opened 17 new cinemas with 165 screens in the United Kingdom. The
availability of attractive site locations for our cinemas is subject to various factors that are beyond our
control. These factors include:

- local conditions, such as scarcity of space or increase in demand for real estate, demographic
changes and changes in planning laws; and

- competition for site locations from other cinema companies and from other businesses.

In addition, we typically require two to three years from the time we identify a site to the opening of the
cinema. Construction of new cinemas could result in cost overruns, delays in the timetable or
unanticipated expenses related to planning or other laws. Developers may have difficulty in obtaining
financing for new developments. Furthermore, although our management team carefully monitors new
site development and selects locations for new cinema builds as part of its strategy to select the ‘‘right’’
place, build the ‘‘right’’ size and pay the ‘‘right’’ rent, these new cinema sites may not perform to our
expectations, due to factors such as location selection, deterioration of markets in which new cinemas
are located or unexpected competition in new markets as a result of new cinemas, which could
negatively impact our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_Industry-wide conversion to digital-based media may increase our costs and risks of litigation._**

The different markets in which we operate are at different stages in the process of converting to digitalbased media. In the United Kingdom, we completed our conversion to digital-based media in August
2012. In relation to the proposed Multikino Acquisition in Poland, digitalization was completed in 2011,
and in Germany and Denmark, digitalization is ongoing and expected to be completed by the end of July
2013. The ongoing conversion to digital-based media and technology in Germany may result in cost

37


-----

overruns, delays in the timetable or unanticipated expenses, as a result of labor disruptions or other
factors. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the expected performance and operating benefits
associated with the conversion to digital-based media will be realized.

The industry is at different stages in adjusting to the conversion from celluloid-based media to digitalbased media. There are a variety of constituencies associated with this change that significantly impact
industry participants, including content providers, film distributors, equipment providers and cinema
operators. To help finance the cost of conversion to digital projection, film distributors pay virtual print
fees to cinema operators (or third-party intermediaries) based on films presented on approved digital
projection platforms. Generally, film distributors continue to pay virtual print fees after a cinema has
converted to digital projection until a cost recoupment date or threshold has been reached. Multikino
continues to receive virtual print fees directly from film distributors, while in the United Kingdom and
Germany virtual print fees are paid to third party intermediaries. There can be no assurance that these
payments will be received or that recovery of the costs associated with digitalization will occur. Delayed
or non-recovery of the full amount of these costs may have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations or financial condition.

Our digital projector contracts are subject to complex contractual obligations, such as maintaining
projectors to strict technical specifications, training our staff to operate the projectors, taking action to
protect digital content from piracy and theft and various accounting and reporting requirements. If we fail
to comply with our contractual obligations, the content providers may withdraw their support.
Additionally, if we fail to adequately protect film content from piracy, we may be subject to litigation from
film content providers. There can be no assurance that technology providers will continue to supply
digital projectors or that the content providers will continue to provide financial support for digital
conversion in the future and we may not have access to adequate capital to finance the technology
purchases and conversion costs to continue the roll-out of digital-based media.

Additionally, digital-based media is a relatively new technology. Our digital projectors or the cinema
management systems associated with the digital projectors may break down and lead to a disruption in
film exhibition. Isolated incidents of film disruption may lead to customer dissatisfaction. Larger scale
technology problems may affect either a particular cinema or a particular piece of equipment common at
many of our cinemas. A large scale breakdown in technology could have a material adverse impact on
our admissions, on the continuing financial support for digital transformation by the content providers,
on our results of operations, on our financial condition and on our industry reputation. We rely on
external suppliers for maintenance and repair of our digital projectors. We cannot guarantee that
maintenance will be performed in a timely or effective manner.

**_Our results of operations may be impacted by shrinking film release windows._**

The film release window represents the time that elapses from the date of a film’s exclusive release in
cinemas to the date a film is available for downstream markets, such as DVD, Blu-ray, pay-per-view and
cable. While the average film release window has not declined significantly across Europe in recent
years, film distributors may, in the future, seek to shorten the film release window.

Furthermore, film distributors may choose to release their films through other channels rather than
through cinema operators and could also reduce or eliminate the film release window in its entirety by
releasing films simultaneously to cinemas and in alternative film delivery format. If customers choose an
alternative film viewing activity, rather than attending a cinema for viewing, our business, results of
operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. We cannot assure you that the
film release window, which is determined by the film distributors, will not shrink further or be eliminated
altogether. If the release window shrinks or is eliminated altogether, admissions would be negatively
affected which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial
condition.

**_We depend on key personnel for our current and future performance._**

Our current and future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of
our senior management team and other key personnel. The loss or unavailability of any member of our
senior management team or a key employee could significantly impair our business. We cannot assure
you that we would be able to locate or employ qualified replacements for senior management or key
employees on acceptable terms.

38


-----

**_We may not be able to generate anticipated levels of revenue from concession sales._**

We generate significant revenue through concession sales, consisting of food, confectionery and drink
sales. Concession sales form the largest source of our revenue after box office receipts. Concession
revenue is impacted by the types and lengths of films that we play and the exhibition format. General
economic conditions may also impact consumer spending patterns on concessions. If for any reason,
consumers spend less on concessions in the future, this could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_We may not be able to generate anticipated levels of revenue from advertising (including screen_**
**_advertising), alternative content or ancillary sources._**

We generate revenue from advertising sales, the exhibition of alternative content and ancillary sources
such as ticket booking fees. Advertising sales are affected by levels of admissions and overall
advertising market trends. In the United Kingdom and Germany, we experience a significantly higher
profit margin on advertising, particularly on screen advertising, than on box office receipts or concession
sales. Currently, the majority of our screen advertising arrangements are with Digital Cinema Media
(‘‘DCM’’) in the United Kingdom and with WerbeWeischer GmbH & Co. KG (‘‘WerbeWeischer’’) in
Germany. In previous years, our screen advertising arrangements included minimum guarantees which
countered decreasing revenue from screen advertising resulting from a decline in the screen advertising
market. Neither of the contracts with DCM or WerbeWeischer provide for minimum guarantees. A decline
or fluctuation in the screen advertising market would affect our ability to generate revenue through
screen advertising sales.

Additionally, we show alternative content, such as sporting and cultural events and provide alternative
uses of our cinemas for meetings or other corporate events. Our ability to achieve our business
objectives may depend in part on our success in increasing these revenue streams. We cannot assure
you that we will be able to effectively generate revenue from the exhibition of alternative content.

Furthermore, we generate revenue through booking fees for tickets. We may, in the future, be forced to
cease collecting booking fees on ticket sales as a result of regulation or other factors.

**_We may not realize the expected benefits from our operational improvement or revenue enhancing_**
**_capital expenditure initiatives._**

In order to improve the efficiency of our operations, we have implemented and continue to implement
certain operational improvement initiatives, including a more sophisticated approach to content
scheduling, ticket price strategy changes and energy saving initiatives. Operational improvements
include our pricing strategy initiatives in our cinemas in the United Kingdom encompassing our premium
3D, Vue Xtreme and VIP seat offers and discount promotions such as our ‘‘Super Saver Tuesdays’’ offer,
‘‘Orange Wednesday’’ promotion and ‘‘Kids AM’’ offer. There can be no assurance that our discount
offerings will not adversely impact any revenue derived from our standard or premium offerings.
Furthermore, we have invested and will continue to invest, in revenue enhancing capital expenditure,
including additional screens, premium screens, additional VIP seating and digitalization. We cannot
assure you that we will realize the level of expected cost savings or revenue increases or improve our
operating performance as a result of our past, current and planned operational improvement and
revenue enhancing capital expenditure initiatives. We may also be subject to significant cost increases
beyond our control, such as increases in statutory minimum wage requirements, film rental costs, rent
reviews, energy prices or the cost of our goods sold.

**_Our operations are subject to extensive regulations which may increase our costs and adversely_**
**_affect us._**

The cinema industry is regulated by various laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate.
The scope of such regulation includes infrastructure, employment and operational issues relating to
cinemas, as well as safety and security requirements. We cannot fully anticipate all changes that might
be made, in the future, to laws and regulations, nor the possible impact of all such changes. Our ability to
conduct our business is dependent on our ability to maintain authorizations, licenses and certificates.
We are routinely audited to ensure compliance with all cinema and retail operation requirements,
including compliance with age restrictions as dictated by film ratings that are determined by film
classification authorities. There can be no assurances that our licenses will be renewed or that we will
pass all audits in the future. If we fail to pass such audits or if we are found to be in breach of regulations

39


-----

applicable to us, we could face fines, revocation of operating licenses, adverse publicity or closure of our
cinemas, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or
financial condition. We are also subject to potential increases in the statutory minimum wage and other
changes in employment regulation in the markets in which we operate. In addition, we are subject to
levies on box office revenue. Any related increases in these levies by governmental or non-governmental
bodies in the markets in which we operate could have a material adverse impact on our business, results
of operations and financial condition.

We rely on local language films, in addition to Hollywood films. Production and distribution of such local
films may depend upon government support, and we cannot guarantee this support will continue in the
future. Consequently, changes in laws or regulations or licensing or government support could have a
material adverse impact on our cost of operations or revenue from operations.

Furthermore, we sell and advertise various products including alcohol, confectionery products and soft
drinks and also collect booking fees on certain ticket sales. The sale and advertising of these and other
products may be subject to additional regulation and restrictions in the future. Any restriction on our
ability to sell or advertise certain products or collect booking fees may limit our ability to generate
revenue from these sources in the future, which would have a material adverse impact on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

**_Instances of illness, epidemics or terrorist attacks, as well as negative publicity relating thereto,_**
**_could result in reduced admissions and materially and adversely impact our business, results of_**
**_operations or financial condition._**

Instances of illness, whether or not traced to our cinemas, could reduce admissions at our cinemas
materially. Claims of illness, whether or not traced to our cinemas, relating to food quality or handling at
the retail stands could also cause us to lose admissions materially. In addition, any negative publicity
relating to these and other health related matters might affect consumers’ perceptions of our cinemas, or
cinemas in general, and reduce admissions to our cinemas materially. The outbreak of a prolonged
pandemic or epidemic disease or the occurrence of any other public health concern could negatively
impact the public’s willingness to gather in public spaces, which could reduce admissions or revenue at
our cinemas. In addition, any such public health concerns may severely restrict the level of economic
activity in affected areas. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. In addition, an actual or threatened terrorist attack or public
disorder, such as the riots in the United Kingdom during summer of 2011, could cause people to avoid
going out into public areas or visiting our cinemas or other public places where large crowds are in
attendance.

**_Product recalls and associated costs could adversely affect our reputation and financial condition._**

We sell food and beverages, the sale of which involves legal and other risks. For example, we may need
to recall food products if they become contaminated. Even though we are resellers of food, we may be
liable if the consumption of any of the products we sell causes illness or injury. A recall could result in
losses due to the cost of the recall, the destruction of product, reduced consumer demand and lost sales
due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. A significant food recall could result in adverse
publicity, damage to our reputation and loss of consumer confidence in our cinemas, which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_We may suffer future impairment losses, as a result of potential declines in the fair value of our_**
**_assets._**

The opening of new cinemas by us and certain of our competitors has drawn audiences away from some
of our other cinemas. In addition, demographic changes and competitive pressures have caused, and
may in the future cause, some of our cinemas to become unprofitable. As a result, we may choose to
close certain cinemas, pay lease termination charges or recognize impairment losses related to the
decrease in value of particular cinemas. We review long-lived assets, including intangibles, for
impairment as part of our financial year-end process and whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. We continually monitor the
performance of our cinemas, and factors such as changing consumer preferences for filmed
entertainment and our inability to sublease vacant space could negatively impact operating results and

40


-----

result in future closures, sales, dispositions and significant cinema and other closure charges prior to
expiration of underlying lease agreements.

We have a significant amount of goodwill. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at the end of the first full
financial year following acquisition and in other periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment by computing the
fair value of a reporting unit and comparing it with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the reporting
unit exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment is recorded. Significant judgment is involved in
estimating cash flows and fair value. Management’s fair value estimates are based on historical and
projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples.
Declines in our attendance due to increased competition in certain regions or countries, or economic
factors that lead to a decline in attendance in any of our markets could negatively affect our estimated fair
values and could result in further impairments of goodwill.

We also have a significant amount of tradename intangible assets. Tradename intangible assets are
tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not
be fully recoverable. We estimate the fair value of our tradenames by applying an estimated market
royalty rate that could be charged for the use of our tradename to forecasted future revenue, with an
adjustment for the present value of such royalties. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying
value, the tradename intangible asset is written down to its estimated fair value. Significant judgment is
involved in estimating market royalty rates and long-term revenue forecasts. Management’s estimates
are based on historical and projected revenue performance and industry trends.

Deterioration in the performance of our cinemas could require us to recognize additional impairment
losses and we may choose to close cinemas in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of our operations or financial condition. We cannot assure you that significant
impairment charges will not be required in the future, and such charges may have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_We have significant deferred tax assets which may not be recoverable._**

For the year ended December 31, 2012, our CinemaxX operations in Germany maintained a deferred tax
asset of e19.5 million. We determine the value of our deferred tax asset by estimating future taxable
income, taking into account various uncertainties in future cash flows and taxable profits. Our ability to
use these deferred tax assets and the carrying value of these assets, are dependent upon having future
taxable income in Germany during the periods in which we are permitted to use our tax loss carryforwards. If our estimates of our future taxable income and future cash flows in Germany are not
accurate, the full value of these deferred tax assets may not be available to reduce our future tax
liabilities, and the value of these assets may be subject to impairment. Furthermore, a change of control
of Vue Entertainment International Limited or CinemaxX of more than 50% could result in the loss of our
deferred tax assets. A partial change in ownership in CinemaxX of 25% to 50% could result in a
proportional loss of our German deferred tax assets. Following a change of control as described above,
a loss forefeiture may only occur to the extent that existing losses exceed the taxable hidden reserves of
the loss owning CinemaxX companies and their holding companies. Accordingly, there is a risk that a
partial change in ownership or change of control could result in the loss or impairment of our German tax
assets.

**_A failure to adapt to future technological innovations could negatively impact our ability to_**
**_compete effectively and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or_**
**_financial condition._**

New technological innovations continue to impact our industry. We may be unable to respond to or
invest in changes in technology and the technological preferences of our customers. For example, some
of our competitors have invested in a greater number of 3D-capable screens, and if consumer
preferences were to change rapidly in favor of 3D films, we may not be able to compete with other
cinema operators. Any such rapid change in technology or related consumer demand could materially
adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_We are subject to risk related to our leases._**

Periodically, our leases are subject to rent review and our rent may be increased according to prevailing
market rates, inflation or other contractual conditions. Rent increases may adversely affect our earnings.

41


-----

Certain of our leases permit the landlord to terminate the lease if there is a default under the lease,
including, for example, our failure to pay rent, service charges, insurance or applicable taxes in a timely
fashion. Additionally, in Poland, in certain circumstances, the leases can be terminated by the
bankruptcy administrator after the landlord’s bankruptcy. If a landlord were to terminate one of our
leases, this would halt our operations at that cinema and could have a negative impact on our financial
condition and results of operations. Furthermore, in Germany, certain of our leases require us to give
bank guarantees as collateral to landlords. Any disputes that may result from such a termination may be
expensive to pursue and may divert money and management’s attention from our other operations and
adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

If we decide to close certain cinema sites, we would still be liable in respect of all obligations under the
leases for those sites. The majority of our cinemas are held pursuant to leases with long terms which
cannot be terminated early by the tenant. Under most of these leases, we are not permitted to terminate
the lease even if we cease operating the cinema because it is not profitable. We expect additional
cinemas that we may acquire in the future to be subject to similar long-term, non-terminable leases. If we
decide to close an existing or future cinema, we may be committed to perform our obligations under the
applicable lease which would include, among other things, payment of the base rent for the balance of
the lease term, which would reduce our profitability and limit our ability to expand in other locations.

The majority of our sites are leased from third parties for a fixed term although some leases incorporate
contractual rights to extend the lease term. At the end of the lease term or any lease extension, if
applicable, we may be unable to renew the lease without substantial additional cost, if at all. If we are
unable to renew our leases, we may be forced to close or relocate a cinema, which could subject us to
construction and other costs and risks, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations or financial condition. For example, closing a cinema, including during the time of
relocation, will reduce the amounts that the cinema would have contributed to our revenue. Additionally,
revenue and profit, if any, generated at a relocated cinema may not equal the revenue and profit
generated at the existing cinema. We also face competition for suitable sites for new cinemas. As a
result, we may not be able to secure or renew leases for appropriate sites and/or at acceptable rent
levels.

**_Work stoppages and other labor problems could negatively impact our future profits._**

Some of our employees are represented by labor unions and labor councils and more may be in the
future. We have experienced minor work stoppages in Germany in the past, and there can be no
assurance that we will not experience more significant work stoppages or other labor disruptions in the
future. A lengthy strike or collective bargaining negotiation at one or more cinemas or in one or more
territory or other work stoppage at one or more of our cinemas could have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations or financial condition. The impact of this potential union and
collective bargaining activity is undetermined and could negatively impact our profits. Furthermore, we
schedule our cinema employees on a flexible basis according to demand and any change in our ability
to use a flexible work schedule could impact our operating efficiency, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business.

**_We rely on information technology in our operations and administration. Any material failure,_**
**_inadequacy, interruption or breach of security of that technology could harm our ability to_**
**_effectively operate our business and subject us to data loss, litigation, liability, including liability for_**
**_theft of film content, and reputational harm._**

We rely on computer systems for ticket sales, sales of retail goods and promotional activity. Additionally,
we rely on our computer systems to manage most cinema-level administrative functions such as
coordinating payroll, tracking cinema invoices, generating operating reports to analyze film
performance and cinema profitability and generating information to detect theft. Disruption of our
information technology systems could result in difficulty collecting revenue from our customers, loss of
important data, an increase in expenses and disruption in our marketing and promotional activities. We
rely on centralized information systems across our operations for efficient film scheduling and
advertising of seat availability. Our ability to effectively operate and manage our business depends
significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. We rely on computer systems for the
exhibition of our films. Any breakdown in these systems could result in a disruption or cancellation of the
showing of a particular film, or the closure of a screen until the technology can be repaired. In addition,
failure of the information technology related to our digitalization, including the satellite or broadband

42


-----

hardware and connection which allow for delivery of digital films to our cinemas, could negatively impact
the operation of and cost savings derived from our digitalization roll-out.

Despite our efforts and investment in technology to secure our computer network, security could be
compromised. For instance, in connection with credit card sales, we transmit confidential credit card
information securely over a private network and store it in an encrypted form in our data warehouse. We
also store customer information such as names and address details (at the option of the customer) in a
computer database for marketing purposes. Third parties may have the technology or know-how to
access and breach the security of this customer information, and our security measures may not
effectively prohibit others from obtaining improper access to this information. If a person is able to
circumvent our security measures, he or she could destroy or steal valuable information or disrupt our
operations.

We also collect and retain large volumes of internal and customer data that are entered into, processed
by, summarized by and reported by our various information systems. If that data is not accurate or
complete we could make faulty decisions. We also maintain personally identifiable information about our
employees. Any virus, security breach, loss, or theft of company, customer or employee data could
expose us to adverse publicity, loss of sales and profits, or cause us to incur significant costs to
reimburse third parties for damages, which could impact our business, results of operations or financial
condition.

**_Disruption or non-renewal of our relationship with our key suppliers could materially adversely_**
**_affect our business, results of operations or financial condition._**

We have supply relationships for certain of our concessions products including soft drinks, popcorn and
confectionery, as well as for certain technologies for our cinemas. If any of our key relationships were
changed or terminated for any reason, including due to termination arising from a change of control
event or as a result of any disagreement, we could be forced to negotiate a number of substitute
arrangements with alternative vendors which may be on terms less favorable to us.

Our agreements with our suppliers often provide that they may raise supply costs through the term of the
agreements. Our margins on concessions and other revenue may thus decline to the extent we are
unable to pass on increases in our costs to our customers at a rate at or near the rate of cost increases,
which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Potential liabilities arising from theft, misuse or loss of film reels, digital hard drives or other_**
**_delivery methods could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition._**

We do not own the intellectual property rights for the films which are stored on the film reels, digital hard
drives or other delivery methods which we use in our cinemas. As a result, a breach of security,
employee fraud or technical failure which results in the theft, misuse or loss of a film reel, digital hard
drive or other delivery method, as well as the contents therein, could make us vulnerable to liability for
theft of film content, and consequently, to claims for damages by film distributors for such theft, misuse
or loss.

**_Changes in privacy laws could adversely affect our ability to market our products effectively._**

Our cinemas rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques, including email marketing. Any expansion
of existing or new laws and regulations regarding marketing, solicitation or data protection could
adversely affect the continuing effectiveness of our email and other marketing techniques and could
result in changes to our marketing strategy. If this occurs, we may not be able to develop adequate
alternative marketing strategies, which could adversely impact our admissions levels and adversely
affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_We participate in industry-wide agreements over which we do not have sole control and the loss of_**
**_which or change in terms of which could affect our business, results of operations or financial_**
**_condition._**

In the United Kingdom, we participate in the ‘‘Orange Wednesday’’ agreement which is an agreement
among mobile network operator Orange, The Film Distributors’ Association and The Cinema Exhibitors’
Association for a 2-for-1 ticket promotion for Orange customers which operates on Wednesdays in the
United Kingdom. ‘‘Orange Wednesday’’ is an industry-wide promotion involving an agreement between
multiple parties with differing views, and as such, we have limited ability to influence the terms of the
agreement. Our admissions associated with ‘‘Orange Wednesday’’ are significant, as Wednesdays are
typically our second busiest day of the week, as a result of this promotion. Any change in or cessation of
the promotion or its success could affect our admissions levels which could adversely affect our
business, results of operations or financial condition.

43


-----

**_General political, social and economic conditions can reduce admissions, profitability and results_**
**_of operations at our cinemas._**

Our success depends on general political, social and economic conditions and the willingness of
consumers to spend discretionary funds on leisure activities. Our customers may have less money for
discretionary purchases because of negative economic conditions such as job losses, foreclosures,
bankruptcies, sharply falling house prices, reduced availability of credit and other matters, resulting in a
decrease in consumer spending or causing consumers to shift their spending to alternative forms of
entertainment. Although GBOR has been relatively unaffected by the economic downturn, if going to the
cinema becomes less popular or consumers spend less on retail products or concessions, our
operations could be adversely affected. Additionally, as our customers generally live within a convenient
travelling distance to our cinemas, an economic downturn that is particular to a region in which our
cinemas are located may have a disproportionately negative impact on our cinemas in the affected
market.

**_Fluctuations in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations._**

Our reporting currency is in pounds sterling, but the results of operations and the financial position of our
operations in Ireland, Portugal and Germany are reported in euros, and our operations in Denmark are
transacted in Danish krone and then translated into euros for reporting purposes. Our operations in
Taiwan are reported in Taiwanese new dollars. Upon completion of the Multikino Acquisition, we expect
our operations in Poland, Latvia and Lithuania to be transacted in Polish złoty, Latvian lats and Lithuanian
litas, respectively, with the Latvian and Lithuanian results being translated into Polish złoty for reporting
purposes. The results of operations across our markets are then, and will be, translated into pounds
sterling at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. Our
financial results are, thus, impacted primarily by currency fluctuations between pound sterling and the
euro and, to a lesser extent, between the pound sterling and the Polish złoty. Our financial results may
also be affected by currency fluctuations between the Polish złoty and each of the Latvian lat and
Lithuanian lita, between the euro and the Danish krone and between the pound sterling and the new
Taiwan dollar. Moreover, a change in the concentration of our business activities could result in an
increased effect of exchange rates on our financial position and results of operations. As our business
continues to grow in markets outside of the United Kingdom, it exacerbates this risk. We do not currently
hedge against foreign currency exchange rate risk. Instead, we currently hedge against currency risk,
generally, by keeping our debt and earnings in proportion to their respective currencies, in the case of
the United Kingdom and the euro-denominated markets. We do not hedge against currency risk with
respect to our remaining operations. There is no assurance that we will, in the future, be successful in
any hedging of our currency risk.

**_We may be subject to liability under laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate,_**
**_including environmental laws and regulations._**

We own and operate cinemas in the United Kingdom, Germany, Denmark, Ireland, Portugal and Taiwan
and, after the Multikino Acquisition, expect to own and operate cinemas in Poland, Latvia and Lithuania.
We are and expect to be subject to the laws and regulations of these jurisdictions, including
environmental laws and laws governing the cleanup of hazardous materials and the management of
properties. In the future, we may operate in additional territories and be subject to additional laws and
regulations. We might in the future be required to participate in the cleanup of a property that we own or
lease, or at which we have been alleged to have disposed of hazardous materials from one of our
cinemas. In certain circumstances, we might be solely responsible for any such liability under
environmental laws, and such claims could be material.

**_The impairment or insolvency of certain financial institutions could adversely affect us._**

We have exposure to different counterparties with regard to our interest rate swap agreements. These
transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by one or more of our counterparties to such
agreements. We also have exposure to financial institutions used as depositories of our corporate cash
balances. If our counterparties or financial institutions become impaired or insolvent, this could have an
adverse impact on our results of operations or impair our ability to access our cash.

44


-----

**_We are subject to taxation which is complex and often requires us to make subjective_**
**_determinations._**

We are subject to many different forms of taxation including but not limited to income tax, withholding
tax, value added tax, stamp duty and social security and other payroll related taxes. Tax law and
administration is complex and often requires us to make subjective determinations. The tax authorities
may not agree with the determinations that are made by us with respect to the application of tax law.
Such disagreements could result in lengthy legal disputes and, ultimately, in the payment of substantial
amounts for tax, interest and penalties, which could have a material effect on our business, results of
operations or financial condition.

**_Potential liabilities and costs from litigation could adversely affect our business._**

We are involved in litigation and regulatory actions as part of our ordinary course of business. In
particular, we are involved in negotiations with a landlord in Portugal in relation to the lease obligations of
our subsidiary, Spean Bridge Cinemas (Algarve) LDA (‘‘SBC Algarve’’), in Portugal and for which a
corporate guarantee has been granted by Vue Entertainment (UK) Limited (‘‘VUEL’’), a dormant Vue
company. If agreement with the landlord cannot be reached, then the landlord may pursue SBC Algarve
or VEUL for monies owed, and we may cease operating in Portugal and incur all costs associated
therewith. See ‘‘Business—Litigation.’’

There is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending against civil suits. Even if a civil litigation
claim is meritless, does not prevail or is not pursued, any negative publicity surrounding assertions
against our cinemas could adversely affect our reputation. Regardless of its outcome, litigation may
result in substantial costs and expenses and divert the attention of our management. In addition to
pending matters, future litigation could lead to increased costs or interruption of our normal business
operations. In addition, there may be health risks of which we are not yet aware related to new
technologies such as 3D which we use in our cinemas, which could lead to potential litigation in the
future.

**Risks Relating to Our Financial Profile**

**_Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business and_**
**_prevent us from fulfilling our obligations with respect to the Notes and the Guarantees._**

We are, and following the issuance of the Notes, will continue to be, highly leveraged. As of April 4, 2013,
after giving effect to the Transactions, our total third-party borrowings would have been approximately
£558.4 million (exclusive of capitalized debt issuance costs and original issue discount (‘‘OID’’), if any),
of which approximately £550.7 million (exclusive of OID and capitalized debt issuance costs) would have
been represented by the Notes, as well as approximately £467.1 million (exclusive of capitalized debt
issuance costs) of loans from the Executive Managers, certain senior management, OMERS and the
AIMCo Entities, specifically the Issuer Loan and the Bridge Loan, with an additional £50.0 million of total
availability under the Revolving Credit Facility. See ‘‘Capitalization.’’

The degree to which we will remain leveraged following the issuance of the Notes could have important
consequences to holders of the Notes offered hereby, including, but not limited to:

- making it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes or other indebtedness;

- increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic
and industry conditions;

- requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the repayment of
principal of, and interest on, indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow, and
limiting the ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditures,
acquisitions, joint ventures, or other general corporate purposes;

- limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the competitive
environment and the industry in which we operate; and

- placing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors, to the extent that they are
not as highly leveraged.

The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations, prospects and ability to satisfy our obligations under the Notes.

45


-----

We and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, including in
connection with any future acquisition. Although the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement will contain restrictions governing the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the restrictions
are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and, under certain circumstances,
the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be
substantial. If we or our subsidiaries incur new debt or other obligations, the related risks that we now
face, as described elsewhere in these ‘‘Risk Factors,’’ could intensify.

For further information regarding our substantial leverage and for more information about our
outstanding indebtedness, see also ‘‘Description of the Notes’’ and ‘‘Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements.’’_

**_We are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future_**
**_operations and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities._**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Indenture will contain covenants, which will restrict,
among other things, our ability to:

- incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock;

- create or incur certain liens;

- make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions, with respect to the shares of
such entity;

- prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity;

- make certain investments;

- create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or
advances to, and on the transfer of, assets to such entity;

- sell, lease or transfer certain assets, including stock of restricted subsidiaries;

- engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

- consolidate or merge with other entities; and

- impair the security interest for the benefit of the holders of the Notes.

All of these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See ‘‘Description of the
_Notes—Certain Covenants’’ and ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Revolving Credit_
_Facility—Covenants—Negative covenants.’’ The covenants to which we are subject could limit our ability_
to finance our future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and
activities that may be in our interest. The restrictions contained in the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement and the Indenture could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to
react to market conditions or take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. For
example, such restrictions could adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, make strategic
acquisitions, investments or alliances, restructure our organization or finance our capital needs.

**_We may incur additional indebtedness, including at the level of our subsidiaries, which could_**
**_increase our risk exposure from debt and could decrease your share in any proceeds._**

Subject to restrictions in the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, we may incur
additional indebtedness, which could increase the risks associated with our already substantial
indebtedness. We have the ability to borrow up to £50.0 million under our Revolving Credit Facility and
any borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility will be senior secured indebtedness, and will receive
proceeds from an enforcement action on the Collateral prior to the Notes. Depending on the ultimate
timing of the Vue Acquisition Completion Date, the Issuer may draw on the Revolving Credit Facility for
up to approximately £15.0 million on or about the Vue Acquisition Completion Date for working capital
purposes and may continue to utilize the Revolving Credit Facility going forward.

Our subsidiaries may also be able to incur substantial indebtedness in the future, further increasing the
risks associated with our substantial leverage. Any indebtedness that we incur at a non-Guarantor
subsidiary level would be structurally senior to the Notes. Additionally, we could raise additional debt
that could be secured or could mature prior to the Notes. Although the Indenture and the Revolving

46


-----

Credit Facility Agreement will contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these
restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain
circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with those restrictions
could be substantial. In addition, the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will not
prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements.

**_We require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our operations. Our ability_**
**_to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors beyond our control, and we may be forced to_**
**_take other actions to satisfy our debt obligations, which may not always be successful._**

Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt, and to fund working capital and capital
expenditures, will depend on our future operating performance and ability to generate sufficient cash.
This depends, to some extent, on the success of our business strategy and on general economic,
financial, competitive, market, legislative, regulatory and other factors, as well as the other factors
discussed in these ‘‘Risk Factors,’’ many of which are beyond our control.

We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future
debt and equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts
when due, including the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs including the repayment of any and all
amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.

If our future cash flow from operations and other capital resources (including borrowings under the
Revolving Credit Facility) are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity
needs, we may be forced to:

- reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures;

- sell assets;

- obtain additional debt or equity capital; or

- restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity.

We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or
on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In particular, our ability to restructure or refinance our debt
will depend in part on our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher
interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict
our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we may be unable to find
alternative financing, and even if we could obtain alternative financing it might not be on terms that are
favorable or acceptable to us. If we are unable to satisfy our obligations through alternative financing, we
may not be able to satisfy our debt obligations, including under the Notes. In that event, borrowings
under other debt agreements or instruments that contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions,
including the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility, may become payable on demand, and we may not
have sufficient funds to repay all our debts, including the Notes.

Any failure to make payments on the Notes on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our
credit rating, which could also harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, the terms or
our debt, including the Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility and any future debt may limit our ability to
pursue any of these alternatives. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face
substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet
our debt service and other obligations. The terms of our debt, including under the Indenture, restrict our
ability to transfer or sell assets. In addition, there can be no assurance that any assets which we could be
required to dispose of can be sold or that, if sold, the timing of such sale and the amount of proceeds
realized from such sale will be acceptable. If we are unsuccessful in any of these efforts, we may not have
sufficient cash to meet our obligations.

**_Certain of our borrowings bear interest at floating rates that could rise significantly, increasing our_**
**_interest cost and reducing cash flow._**

A part of our indebtedness, including borrowings under the Floating Rate Notes and the Revolving Credit
Facility, bears interest at per annum rates equal to the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (‘‘EURIBOR’’), in
each case adjusted periodically, plus a spread. These interest rates could rise significantly in the future,
thereby increasing our interest expenses associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available
for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on the Notes. Although we may

47


-----

enter into certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no
assurance that hedging will be available or continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms.

**_Our acquisition of the ordinary shares of CinemaxX held by the minority shareholders could be_**
**_more expensive than expected._**

In connection with the Squeeze Out, an independent auditor has been appointed to carry out a valuation
of the ordinary CinemaxX shares. The court-appointed independent auditor may determine that the
market value of the shares is higher than the price in the public offer document. If this were to occur we
would be required to pay that higher price in order to acquire the ordinary shares of CinemaxX held by
the minority shareholders. For every e1 increase in the market value of each share above the initial offer
price of e6.45 per share, we would incur an increased liability of e0.7 million.

**Risks Relating to the Notes and the Guarantees**

**_Creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging arrangements and certain debt that_**
**_we may incur in the future will be entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the Collateral sold in_**
**_any enforcement sale in priority to the Notes._**

The Notes will, as far as is possible under law, be secured by the same Collateral that will secure on a
first-ranking basis our obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations.
The Indenture will also permit the same Collateral to be pledged on a pari passu basis with the Notes, to
secure additional indebtedness in accordance with the terms thereof and the Intercreditor Agreement.
The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement may limit the amount of hedging that can be ‘‘superpriority’’ hedging.

In the event of enforcement of the Collateral securing the Notes, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement,
the liabilities under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and certain hedging obligations, as well as
certain future indebtedness permitted to be incurred in accordance with the Indenture will have priority
over any amounts received from the sale of the Collateral pursuant to an enforcement action taken with
respect to such Collateral. Additionally, certain liabilities or obligations may have priority over or rank pari
_passu in respect of any amounts received from the sale of the Collateral due to the rules of the applicable_
laws (including, without limitation, costs of enforcement actions, tax liabilities, liabilities to employees of
a bankrupt entity). In the event of a foreclosure of the Collateral, you may not be able to recover on such
Collateral if the then outstanding claims under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and such
amounts in respect of such hedging obligations and any other ‘‘super-priority’’ indebtedness are greater
than the proceeds realized. In addition, any proceeds from an enforcement sale of the Collateral by any
creditor will, after all obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and such amounts in
respect of such hedging obligations and other ‘‘super-priority’’ indebtedness have been discharged
from such recoveries, be applied pro rata in repayment of any other obligations secured by such
Collateral. Such additional indebtedness secured by the Collateral may be significant. As a result,
holders of Notes may receive less, ratably, than holders of other secured indebtedness.

**_The holders of the Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral._**

Pursuant to the voting provisions set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement, the lenders under the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and counterparties to certain hedging agreements (the ‘‘Super
Senior Creditors’’) will have effective control with respect to the Collateral. The Intercreditor Agreement
provides that a common security agent will serve as Security Agent for the secured parties under the
Revolving Credit Facility and the Notes with respect to the shared Collateral. In the event that the shared
Collateral has become enforceable, the Security Agent shall enforce or refrain from enforcing such
Collateral on the instructions of (a) the majority (more than 66[2]⁄3% by value) of the Super Senior Creditors
and (b) the majority (more than 50% by value) of the holder of the Notes and other pari passu creditors (if
any).

However disputes may occur between the holders of the Notes and lenders under the Revolving Credit
Facility as to the appropriate manner of pursuing enforcement remedies and strategies with respect to
the shared Collateral. If the Security Agent receives conflicting instructions from the majority Super
Senior Creditors and from the holders of the Notes and the _pari passu creditors, then, to the extent_
instructions from the holders of the Notes and the pari passu creditors are given in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will comply with such instructions, provided that, if the
liabilities owed to the Super Senior Creditors have not been fully and finally discharged in cash within six

48


-----

months of the relevant proposed enforcement instruction date or if no enforcement has occurred within
three months of the relevant proposed enforcement instruction date, the instructions of the majority
Super Senior Creditors will prevail.

The creditors under our Revolving Credit Facility may have interests that are different from the interests
of holders of the Notes and they may elect to pursue their remedies in respect of the shared Collateral at
a time and in a manner which would otherwise be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so.

In addition, if the Security Agent sells Collateral comprising the shares of the Company or the shares of
any of our subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement, claims under the Notes and the Guarantees and the liens over any other assets securing the
Notes and the Guarantees may be released. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement’’ and ‘‘Description of the Notes—Collateral—Release of the Collateral.’’_

**_The Squeeze Out could take longer than anticipated, which would delay the granting of Security_**
**_Interests in the assets of CinemaxX and its subsidiaries as well as delay the issuance of the_**
**_Guarantees by the CinemaxX Guarantors._**

We acquired an initial 91.34% stake in CinemaxX on August 7, 2012 and subsequently increased our
stake to 97.47% as at April 4, 2013. We expect to acquire the remaining ordinary shares of CinemaxX
from the minority shareholders later in 2013. As an _Aktiengesellschaft, a stock corporation under_
German law, CinemaxX is currently restricted in its ability to grant security interests in the Collateral and
issue Guarantees. Before CinemaxX grants Security Interests in the assets of CinemaxX and its
subsidiaries and issues Guarantees, it must be converted into a Gesellschaft mit beschr¨ankter Haftung, a
German limited company. This conversion is subject to registration within the commercial register. The
conversion process normally takes up to three months to complete; however, this conversion can only
be initiated once the remaining ordinary shares have been acquired from the minority shareholders. If
the acquisition of the remaining ordinary shares of CinemaxX or the subsequent change in legal form
takes longer than expected, it would result in a delay in the granting of Security Interests in the assets of
CinemaxX and its subsidiaries and the issuance of Guarantees by the CinemaxX Guarantors. If either the
acquisition of the remaining ordinary shares or the conversion fail, CinemaxX may remain unable to
grant Security Interests described in this offering memorandum.

**_The holders of the Notes may be limited in their ability to take enforcement action in respect of the_**
**_Collateral._**

The security interests in the Collateral that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and
the obligations of the Guarantors under the Guarantees will not be granted directly to the holders of the
Notes, but will be granted only in favor of the Security Agent. The Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement will provide that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, only the Security Agent has the
right to enforce the Security Documents relating to the Collateral on behalf of the Trustee and the holders
of the Notes. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, holders of the Notes will not have direct
security interests in the Collateral and be barred from taking enforcement action in respect of the
Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee who will (subject to the provisions of such
Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent.

In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests is subject to mandatory
provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the Collateral are taken. For
example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for the appropriation of certain pledged assets,
but require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. There is some
uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the
Notes that are not identified as registered holders in a security document will be validly secured.

In certain jurisdictions, including Germany, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the
creation and perfection of security interests and the enforceability of such security interests, the
Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of ‘‘parallel debt’’ obligations in favour of the
Security Agent (‘‘Parallel Debt’’) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors towards
holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture (‘‘Principal Obligations’’). The pledges in
such jurisdictions will be granted to the Security Agent as security interests for the Parallel Debt and will
not directly secure the Principal Obligations. The Parallel Debt will be at all times in the same amount and
payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations. Any payment in respect of the Principal
Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel

49


-----

Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. In respect of the security interests granted
to secure the Parallel Debt, the holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be
entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Security
Agent. Therefore, the holders of the Notes will bear the risk of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security
Agent. In addition, the Parallel Debt construct has not been tested under law in certain of these
jurisdictions and to the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created under the Parallel Debt
construct are not validly granted or are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will
not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of such security interests in the Collateral.

**_The proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations_**
**_under the Notes._**

The Collateral will secure on a first-ranking basis our obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, the
Notes and certain hedge agreements. The Collateral may also secure additional debt to the extent
permitted by the terms of the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor
Agreement. The rights of holders of the Notes to the Collateral may be diluted by any increase in the firstranking debt secured by the Collateral.

The value of the Collateral and the amount to be received upon an enforcement of such Collateral will
depend upon many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale,
whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, general economic conditions of and the
availability of buyers. The book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable
value for such assets. All or a portion of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily
ascertainable market value. Likewise, we cannot assure you that there will be a market for the sale of the
Collateral, or, if such a market exists, that there will not be a substantial delay in its liquidation. In addition,
the pledges, shares and ownership interests of an entity may be of no value if that entity is subject to an
insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding. Furthermore, under Polish law the bankruptcy receiver may
prohibit a separate enforcement and sale of the Collateral by a secured creditor and instead it may opt
for the sale of the whole bankruptcy estate (as going concern), including the Collateral, if the receiver
considers such sale as more commercially beneficial.

**_The Issuer and the Guarantors will have control over certain of the Collateral, and the operation of_**
**_the business or the sale of particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes._**

The Security Documents allow the Issuer and the Guarantors to remain in possession of, retain exclusive
control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from, certain of the Collateral.
So long as no default or event of default under the Indenture would result therefrom, the Issuer and the
Guarantors, may, among other things, subject to the terms of the Security Documents, without any
release or consent by the applicable Trustee or the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities
with respect to the Collateral such as selling, modifying, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of
the Collateral and making ordinary course cash payments, including repayments of indebtedness. Any
of these activities could reduce the value of the Collateral, which could reduce the amounts payable to
you from the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral in the case of an enforcement of the liens on the
Collateral.

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral._**

The Collateral will be subject to exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens, loss of legal perfection and
other imperfections permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement and accepted by
other creditors that have the benefit of first-ranking liens in the Collateral from time to time, whether on or
after the date the Notes are first issued. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances,
liens, loss of legal perfection and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral, as
well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the firstranking liens can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of
perfection requirements, statutory liens or recharacterization under English law.

The security interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated
with the realization of security interests in collateral. For example, the Security Agent may need to obtain
the consent of a third party (including, without limitation, relevant governmental agencies, e.g., relevant
competition authorities) to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that the Security Agent will
be able to obtain any such consents. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties

50


-----

will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent
may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly
decrease.

**_The rights of holders of the Notes may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security_**
**_interests in the Collateral._**

Under English law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly
perfected, and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the
grantor of the security. The liens in the Collateral may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the
Notes if we fail or the Security Agent fails or are unable to take the actions we are required to take to
perfect any of these liens. In addition, English law requires that a security interest over certain property
and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest, such as real property, equipment
subject to a certificate and certain proceeds, can only be perfected at or promptly following the time
such property and rights are acquired and identified.

The Trustee and the Security Agent will not monitor, and we may not comply with our obligations to
inform the Trustee or Security Agent of, any future acquisition of property and rights by us, and the
necessary action may not be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after acquired
property or rights. Such failure may result in the invalidity of the relevant security interest in the Collateral
or adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favor of the Notes against third parties,
including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same Collateral.

**_The granting of the security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes or the_**
**_incurrence of permitted debt in the future may create or restart hardening periods._**

The granting of security interests to secure the Notes and the Guarantees may create hardening periods
for such security interests in certain jurisdictions. The granting of shared security interests to secure
future indebtedness permitted to be secured on the Collateral may restart or reopen such hardening
periods in particular, as the Indenture will permit the release and retaking of security granted in favor of
the Notes in certain circumstances including in connection with the incurrence of future indebtedness.
The applicable hardening period for these new security interests can run from the moment each new
security interest has been granted, perfected or recreated. At each time, if the security interest granted,
perfected or re-created were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening period
applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to
enforce it. If the grantor of such security interest were to become subject to a bankruptcy or winding up
proceeding after the Vue Acquisition Completion Date and the Multikino Acquisition Completion Date,
any security interest in Collateral delivered after the Vue Acquisition Completion Date and the Multikino
Acquisition Completion Date would face a greater risk than security interests in place on the Vue
Acquisition Completion Date and the Multikino Acquisition Completion Date of being avoided by the
grantor or by its trustee, receiver, liquidator, administrator or similar authority, or otherwise set aside by a
court, as a preference under insolvency law. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided,
holders of the Notes would lose the benefit of the security interest. See ‘‘Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.’’ The_
same rights and risks also will apply with respect to future security interests granted in connection with
the accession of further subsidiaries as additional Guarantors and the granting of security interests over
their relevant assets and equity interests for the benefit of holders of the Notes. See ‘‘Description of the
_Notes—Collateral.’’_

There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the applicable
Collateral or Guarantees will be released automatically without your consent or the consent of the
Trustee.

Under various circumstances, the Collateral will be released automatically, including:

- in connection with any sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of such property
or assets (including capital stock of Subsidiaries) to a Person that is not (either before or after giving
effect to such transaction) the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, if the sale or other
disposition does not violate the ‘‘Asset Sale’’ provisions of the Indenture;

51


-----

- in connection with any sale, transfer or other disposition of capital stock of that Guarantor or any
holding company of such Guarantor to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to
such transaction) the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale, transfer or other disposition
does not violate the ‘‘Asset Sale’’ provisions of the Indenture and the Guarantor ceases to be a
Restricted Subsidiary as a result of the sale, transfer or other disposition;

- in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Indenture,
the release of the property and assets of such Guarantor;

- if the Company designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary (as defined in
‘‘Description of the Notes’’) in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, the release of the
property and assets, and capital stock, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary;

- as described under the caption ‘‘Description of the Notes—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver;’’

- in accordance with the covenant described under ‘‘Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—
_Impairment of Security Interest;’’ and_

- upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as
provided under the captions ‘‘Description of the Notes—Legal Defeasance and Covenant
_Defeasance’’ and ‘‘Description of the Notes—Satisfaction and Discharge;’’_

- as permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement, the Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

- upon a release of the Lien that resulted in the creation of the Lien under the covenant described
under the caption ‘‘Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Liens.’’

In addition, under various circumstances, the Guarantees will be released automatically, including, but
not limited to:

- upon a sale or other disposition of all the capital stock of the relevant Guarantor or of all or
substantially all the assets of the Guarantor otherwise permitted by the Indenture;

- if the Company designates any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor to be an Unrestricted
Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

- pursuant to a transaction permitted by the covenant as described under ‘‘Description of the Notes—
_Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets;’’_

- as described under ‘‘Description of the Notes—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver;’’

- upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as
provided under ‘‘Description of the Notes—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance’’ and
‘‘Description of the Notes—Satisfaction and Discharge;’’

See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement’’ and ‘‘Description of the
_Notes.’’_

**_The Issuer is a holding company dependent upon cash flows from its subsidiaries to meet its_**
**_obligations on the Notes._**

The Issuer is a holding company that conducts no business operations of its own and has no significant
assets other than the shares it holds in its subsidiaries. Payment of interest and repayment of our
indebtedness, including under the Notes, will be wholly dependent on the ability of our subsidiaries to
make such cash available to us, by either dividend distributions or intercompany loans, or both . Our
subsidiaries may not be able to, or may be restricted by the terms of their existing or future indebtedness
or by law, in their ability to make such dividend distributions or advance upstream loans to enable us to
make payments in respect of our indebtedness, including the Notes. Each of our subsidiaries is a
distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our
ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries.

While the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement limit the ability of our subsidiaries to
incur contractual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to
us, these limitations are subject to certain significant qualifications and exceptions. We cannot assure
you that arrangements with our subsidiaries, the funding permitted by the agreements governing
existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries and our results of operations and cash flow
generally will provide us with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans to fund payments on the Notes.

52


-----

In the event that we do not receive distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries, we may be
unable to make required principal and interest payments on the Notes. We do not expect to have any
other sources of funds that would allow us to make payments to holders of the Notes.

**_After the Transactions, the interests of our controlling shareholders may be inconsistent with the_**
**_interests of holders of Notes._**

The interests of our principal shareholders, in certain circumstances, may conflict with your interests as
holders of Notes. Our principal shareholders have, and will continue to have, directly or indirectly, the
power, among other things, to affect our legal and capital structure and our day-to-day operations, as
well as the ability to elect and change our management and to approve any other changes to our
operations. For example, our principal shareholders could vote to cause us to incur additional
indebtedness, to sell certain material assets or make dividends distributions, in each case, so long as the
Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement so permit. The
interests of our principal shareholders could conflict with interests of holders of Notes, particularly if we
encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due. Our principal shareholders
could also have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings, dividend distributions or
other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investments although such
transactions might involve risks to the holders of Notes. In addition, our principal shareholders may
come to own businesses that directly compete with our business.

**_We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance a change of control offer._**

Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control (as defined in the Indenture), the
Issuer will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to
101% of the principal amount thereof on the date of purchase, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to
the date of purchase. If a change of control were to occur, we cannot assure you that the Issuer would
have sufficient funds available at such time to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the
restrictions in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or our other
then-existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A change of
control may result in an event of default and/or mandatory prepayment obligation under, or acceleration
of, our Revolving Credit Facility, the Notes and other indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes
pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and other
indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from
its subsidiaries to allow it to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a change of
control may be limited by our then existing financial resources. Sufficient funds may not be available
when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a change of control occurs
at a time when our subsidiaries are prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of
repurchasing the Notes, our subsidiaries may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness
to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If
such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer will remain prohibited from
repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we expect that we would require third party financing to make an
offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. We cannot assure you that we would be able to
obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default
under the Indenture which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement, the Indenture and certain other indebtedness. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Change of
_Control.’’_

The change of control provisions contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in
the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring or other similar
transactions involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve
a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a ‘‘change of
control’’ as defined in the Indenture. Except as described under ‘‘Description of the Notes—Repurchase
_at the Option of Holders—Change of Control,’’ the Indenture will not contain provisions that would_
require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization,
restructuring, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The definition of ‘‘change of control’’ in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or substantially all of
the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is
a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase ‘‘all or substantially all,’’ there is no precise established
definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a

53


-----

degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of ‘‘all or
substantially all’’ of the Issuer’s assets and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may
be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an
offer to repurchase the Notes.

**_The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the creditors of non-Guarantor subsidiaries._**

Not all of our subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. Generally, claims of creditors (both secured and
unsecured) of a non-Guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors of the subsidiary, will have priority
with respect to the assets and earnings of the non-Guarantor subsidiary over the claims of creditors of its
parent entity. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization or other bankruptcy or insolvency
proceeding of any of these non-Guarantor subsidiaries, the holders of their indebtedness and their trade
creditors will generally be entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of those non Guarantor
subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution. As a result, the holders of the Notes
may receive less, on a pro rata basis, than the creditors of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries. The Initial Vue
Guarantors would have represented 69.7% of Vue’s consolidated turnover and 66.6% of Vue’s EBITDA
for the 53 week period ended April 4, 2013, on a U.K. GAAP basis. The CinemaxX Guarantors for the
period following their acquisition, would have represented 21.6% of Vue’s consolidated turnover and
23.8% of Vue’s EBITDA for the 53 week period ended April 4, 2013. In aggregate, the Initial Vue
Guarantors and the CinemaxX Guarantors would have represented 91.3% of Vue’s consolidated
turnover and 90.4% of Vue’s EBITDA for the 53 week period ended April 4, 2013. Such percentages
exclude the pre-acquisition results of CinemaxX. The Multikino Guarantors would have represented
83.6% of Multikino’s consolidated revenue and 93.6% of Multikino’s EBITDA for the twelve month period
ended March 31, 2013 on an IFRS basis.

**_Each Guarantee will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by_**
**_applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability._**

Each Guarantee provides the holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the relevant Guarantor.
However, the Indenture will provide that each Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that can
be guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor without rendering the relevant Guarantee, as it relates to that
Guarantor, voidable or otherwise ineffective or limited under applicable law, and enforcement of each
Guarantee would be subject to certain generally available defenses. See ‘‘Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.’’_

Enforcement of any of the Guarantees against any Guarantor will be subject to certain defenses
available to Guarantors in the relevant jurisdiction. Although laws differ among these jurisdictions, these
laws and defenses generally include those that relate to corporate purpose or benefit, fraudulent
conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, financial assistance,
preservation of share capital, thin capitalization, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or
defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. If one or more of these laws and defenses are
applicable, a Guarantor may have no liability or decreased liability under its Guarantee depending on the
amounts of its other obligations and applicable law. Limitations on the enforceability of judgments
obtained in New York courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of any Guarantee against
any Guarantor.

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and
other laws, a court could (i) avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its
Guarantee, (ii) direct that the holders of Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantee to the
relevant Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors or (iii) take other action that is
detrimental to you, typically if the court found that:

- the relevant Guarantee was incurred with actual intent to give preference to one creditor over
another, hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or, in certain
jurisdictions, when the granting of the Guarantee has the effect of giving a creditor a preference or
when the recipient was aware that the Guarantor was insolvent when it granted the relevant
Guarantee;

- the Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value or corporate benefit
for the relevant Guarantee and the Guarantor was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the
relevant Guarantee; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant

54


-----

Guarantee; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to
pay at maturity;

- the relevant Guarantee was held to exceed the corporate objects of the Guarantor or not to be in the
best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor; or

- the amount paid or payable under the relevant Guarantee was in excess of the maximum amount
permitted under applicable law. These or similar laws may also apply to any future guarantee
granted by any of our subsidiaries pursuant to the Indenture.

We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was
‘‘insolvent’’ at the relevant time or that, regardless of the method of the valuation, a court would not
determine that a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of
whether or not a Guarantor was insolvent on the date its Guarantee was issued, that payments to holders
of the Notes constituted preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds.

The liability of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited to the amount that will result in such
Guarantee not constituting a preference, fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or
otherwise being set aside. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court will apply in
making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor. There is a possibility that the entire
Guarantee may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished.

If a court decided that a Guarantee was a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance and voided such
Guarantee, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, you may cease to have any claim in respect of
the relevant Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and, if applicable, of any other
Guarantor under the relevant Guarantee that has not been declared void. In the event that any
Guarantee is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent the agreed limitation of the
Guarantee obligations apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the
applicable Guarantor, and if we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes or any Guarantee is found
to be a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you
that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes.

The payment of dividends or principal and interest on the intercompany loan to the Issuer will reduce the
distributable profits and reserves available to satisfy the obligations under the Guarantees and Security
Documents. We are under no obligation to maintain a specific level of distributable profits and reserves,
and, if we have distributable profits and reserves, we may make dividend payments or payments of
principal and interest on the intercompany loan that reduce our distributable profits and reserves to zero.
We intend to make dividends and enter into intercompany loans to service indebtedness and for tax
planning purposes. There can be no assurances that we will have distributable profits and reserves
available to satisfy the obligations under the Guarantees and Security Documents, whether or not we
distribute dividends or enter into intercompany loans. The payment of dividends or principal or interest
on the intercompany loan to service our debt obligations (including under the Notes) will deplete the
distributable reserves available to satisfy the obligations under the Guarantees. In addition, the payment
under the Guarantees and the enforcement of security interests under the relevant Security Documents
may require certain prior corporate formalities to be completed, including, but not limited to, obtaining
an audit report, shareholders’ resolutions and board resolutions.

**_Polish financial assistance regulations may adversely affect the validity of the Guarantee of_**
**_Multikino S.A. and the Security Interests securing the Notes to be granted by Multikino S.A._**

Subject to the occurrence of the Multikino Acquisition Completion Date, we intend to use a portion of the
gross proceeds of the Notes to finance the Multikino Acquisition. See ‘‘Use of Proceeds.’’ Under Polish
law, Multikino S.A., as a joint-stock company, is subject to financial assistance restrictions which prohibit
joint stock companies from providing, directly or indirectly, any financing for the purposes of the
acquisition of shares issued by that company, _inter alia, by granting a guarantee or security unless_
certain specific conditions are satisfied (and such conditions will not be satisfied). See ‘‘Limitations on
_Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law_
_Considerations—Poland—Other limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and_
_security.’’ It is the intention that the Guarantee of Multikino S.A. and the Security Interests securing the_
Notes to be granted by Multikino S.A. shall not be provided and/or granted to finance, or support the
financing of, the Multikino Acquisition (either directly or indirectly) and, consequently, prior to the
conversion to a limited liability company, the Guarantee of Multikino S.A. and the Security Interests to be
issued pursuant to the Offering will be limited such that they will not extend to any indebtedness under

55


-----

the Notes utilized for the purposes of the Multikino Acquisition. See ‘‘Description of Notes—Post-Closing
_Guarantors and Post-Closing Collateral—Limitation on Issuances of Guarantees of Indebtedness—_
_Multikino Guarantors.’’ However, in particular, in light of the fact that such limitations on guarantee and_
security interests have not been tested in Polish courts, there can be no assurance that such limitations
will ensure compliance by Multikino S.A. with the applicable Polish financial assistance regulations
and/or that the validity of the Guarantee of Multikino S.A. and the Security Interests to be granted by
Multikino S.A. will not be subject to challenge by other parties on the grounds of contravening such
regulations. If the Guarantee of Multikino S.A. and any Security Interest to be granted by Multikino S.A. is
challenged and, in spite of the limitation, it is held by a competent court to be in contravention of the
Polish financial assistance regulations, the Guarantee of Multikino S.A. and the Security Interests to be
granted by Multikino S.A. may be held to be void. We will be required, pursuant to the terms of the
Indenture, as soon as reasonably practicable after the issuance of the Notes and, in any event, by no
later than nine months after the Multikino Acquisition Completion Date, to use our reasonable best efforts
to complete the transformation of the legal form of Multikino S.A. from a joint stock company (sp´ołka
_akcyjna) to a limited liability company (sp´ołka z ograniczon˛a odpowiedzialno´sci˛a). However, there can_
be no guarantee we will successfully complete the transformation of the legal form.

**_English insolvency laws and the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions may provide you with less_**
**_protection than U.S. bankruptcy law._**

The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. As
such, insolvency proceedings with respect to any of those entities would be likely to proceed under, and
be governed by, English insolvency law. The remaining Guarantors are incorporated in either Jersey,
Ireland, Germany or Poland and insolvency proceedings with respect to these entities will proceed
under, and be governed by Jersey, Irish, German and Polish insolvency law, as applicable. Insolvency
laws in England and Wales, Jersey, Ireland, Germany or Poland may not be as favorable to your interests
as creditors than the bankruptcy laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which investors are
familiar, in particular with respect to priority of creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and the
duration of the insolvency proceedings. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could
call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s laws should apply, adversely affect your ability to
enforce your rights under the Guarantees or the Collateral in these jurisdictions and limit any amounts
that you may receive. See also ‘‘Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the
_Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations’’ for additional information on the insolvency laws_
of the European Union, England and Wales, Germany, Ireland, Jersey and Poland.

**_Investors in the Notes may have limited recourse against the independent auditors._**

Please see ‘‘Independent Auditors’’ for a description of the independent auditors’ reports, including
language limiting the auditors’ scope of duty in relation to such reports and the consolidated financial
statements to which they relate. In particular, the audit reports of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP relating
to the annual financial statements reproduced herein, in accordance with guidance issued by The
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, include a statement to the effect that
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to
anyone other than the members of Vue Entertainment International Limited, as a group, for its audit
reports or the opinions it has formed. The SEC would not permit such limiting language to be included in
a registration statement or a prospectus used in connection with an offering of securities registered
under the U.S. Securities Act or in a report filed under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the ‘‘U.S. Exchange Act’’). If a U.S. court (or any other court) were to give effect to this limiting
language, the recourse that investors in the Notes may have against the independent auditors based on
their reports or the consolidated financial statements to which they relate could be limited.

**_You may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Issuer and its subsidiaries are organized outside the United States, and our business is conducted
entirely outside the United States. Substantially all of the directors and executive officers of the Issuer are
non-residents of the United States. Although the Issuer will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York
courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of
process within the United States on these directors and executive officers. In addition, as all the assets of
the Issuer and its subsidiaries and those of its directors and executive officers are located outside of the
United States, you may be unable to enforce judgments obtained in the U.S. courts against them.

Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Issuer may not be subject
to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States.

The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters with
England and Wales. There is, therefore, doubt as to the enforceability of civil liabilities based upon U.S.
federal securities laws in an action to enforce a U.S. judgment in England and Wales. In addition, the
enforcement in England and Wales of any judgment obtained in a U.S. court based on civil liabilities,
whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, will be subject to certain conditions.
There is also doubt that a court in England and Wales would have the requisite power or authority to
grant remedies sought in an original action brought in England and Wales on the basis of U.S. federal
securities laws violations. For further information, see ‘‘Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil
_Liabilities.’’_

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may_**
**_be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The ratings may
not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors
discussed herein and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a
recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal
by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for
any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit
rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or
withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating
agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely
affect the value and trading of the Notes.

**_Certain covenants may be suspended upon the occurrence of a change in the Group’s ratings._**

The Indenture will provide that, if at any time following the date of the Indenture, the Notes receive a
rating of Baa3 or better by Moody’s and a rating of BBB or better by S&P and no default or event of
default has occurred and is continuing, then beginning that day and continuing until such time, if any, at
which such Notes cease to have such ratings, certain covenants will cease to be applicable to such
Notes. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension of Covenants When Notes Rated
_Investment Grade.’’ If these covenants were to cease to be applicable, the Group would be able to incur_
additional debt or make payments, including dividends or investments, which may conflict with the
interests of holders of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve an
investment grade rating or that any such rating will be maintained.

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the procedures of_**
**_the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

Unless and until the Notes are in definitive registered form, or definitive registered notes are issued in
exchange for book-entry interests (which may occur only in very limited circumstances), owners of
book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of Notes. The nominee of the common
depository for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the global notes.
Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the relevant global notes
representing the Notes will be made to The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch, as paying agent,
which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to
participants’ accounts that hold book entry interests in the global notes representing the Notes and
credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to the common depositary for
Euroclear and Clearstream, we will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal
or other amounts to the owners of book entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book entry interest in
the Notes, you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and if you are not a participant
in Euroclear and/or Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which you own your
interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the Notes under the Indenture.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have any direct rights
to act upon any solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the
Notes. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have
received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream or, if applicable, from a

57


-----

participant. There can be no assurance that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies
will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any matters or on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until the relevant
definitive registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a book entry
interest, you will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. We cannot assure you that
the procedures to be implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the
timely exercise of rights under the Notes.

**_The transfer of the Notes is restricted, which may adversely affect their liquidity and value._**

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act or
the securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction and, unless so registered, may not be offered or
sold in the United States, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the
registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and the applicable securities laws of any state or any
other jurisdiction. The Notes are not being offered for sale in the United States except to ‘‘qualified
institutional buyers’’ in accordance with Rule 144A. See ‘‘Notice to Prospective Investors.’’ We have not
agreed to or otherwise undertaken to register the Notes with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (including by way of an exchange offer). It is the obligation of holders of Notes to ensure
that their offers and sales of the Notes within the United States and other countries comply with
applicable securities laws.

**_Provisions of the EU Savings Directive and other legislation may adversely affect your investment_**
**_in the Notes._**

Under EC Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income, Member States are required
to provide to the tax authorities of another Member State details of payments of interest (or similar
income) paid by a person within its jurisdiction to, or for the benefit of, an individual resident in that other
Member State or to certain limited types of entities established in that other Member State. However, for a
transitional period, Luxembourg and Austria are instead required (unless during that period they elect
otherwise) to operate a withholding system in relation to such payments (the ending of such transitional
period being dependent upon the conclusion of certain other agreements relating to information
exchange with certain other countries). However, during that transitional period, withholding will not
apply under the directive to a payment if the beneficial owner of that payment authorizes exchange of
information instead. A number of non-EU countries and territories (including Switzerland) have adopted
similar measures (a withholding system in the case of Switzerland).

The European Commission has proposed certain amendments to the Directive which may, if
implemented, amend or broaden the scope of the requirements described above.

In April 2013, the Luxembourg Government announced its intention to abolish the withholding system
with effect from January 1, 2015, in favor of automatic information exchange under the Directive.

If a payment were to be made or collected through a Member State which has opted for a withholding
system and an amount of, or in respect of, tax were to be withheld from that payment, no Additional
Amounts would be payable as a result of the imposition of such withholding tax. The Issuer is required to
maintain a Paying Agent in a Member State that is not obliged to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to the
Directive.

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes_**
**_may be limited._**

We cannot assure you as to:

- the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

- your ability to sell your Notes; or

- the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things,
prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the
market for non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial
volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may
be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to

58


-----

disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. The trading market for the Notes may attract different
investors and this may affect the extent to which the Notes may trade. It is possible that the market for the
Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder
of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. As a result, there is no assurance
that there will be an active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not
be able to resell your holding of the Notes at a fair value, if at all. Although an application will be made for
the Notes to be listed on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and to be admitted to trading on the
Global Exchange Market thereof, we cannot assure you that the Notes will become or remain listed.
Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of the admission to trading on
the Global Exchange Market, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting (whether or not for an
alternative admission to listing on another stock exchange) of the Notes, as applicable, from the Official
List of the Irish Stock Exchange may have a material effect on a holder’s ability to resell the Notes, as
applicable, in the secondary market.

**_You may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in pounds sterling and euros. If you measure your
investment returns by reference to a currency other than pounds sterling or euros, an investment in the
Notes will entail foreign exchange related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes
in the value of the pound sterling relative to the currency by reference to which you measure the return
on your investments because of economic, political and other factors over which we have no control.
Depreciation of the pound sterling or the euro against the currency by reference to which you measure
the return on your investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their
stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to you when the return on the Notes is translated into the
currency by reference to which you measure the return on your investments. There may be tax
consequences for you as a result of any foreign exchange gains resulting from an investment in the
Notes. You should consult your tax advisor concerning the tax consequences to you of acquiring,
holding and disposing of the Notes. See ‘‘Certain Tax Considerations.’’

**Risks Relating to the Transactions**

**_The Vue Acquisition and the Multikino Acquisition are subject to significant uncertainties and there_**
**_is a risk that the conditions to the escrow will not be satisfied and we will be required to redeem all_**
**_or certain of the Notes, which means that you may not obtain the return you expect on the Notes._**

On June 9, 2013, the Issuer entered into the Vue Acquisition Agreement providing for the purchase by
the Issuer of all of the issued and outstanding shares of, and preference shares issued by, Vue
Entertainment International Limited from Doughty Hanson and certain members of the senior
management team. The completion of the Vue Acquisition is subject to satisfaction of certain conditions,
including antitrust approval from the European Commission. If the conditions are not satisfied by the
Escrow Longstop Date, unless amended, the Vue Acquisition Agreement will terminate and the Vue
Acquisition will not be completed.

On May 10, 2013, Eudialyte Company sp. z o.o., an indirect subsidiary of Vue Entertainment
International Limited entered into the Multikino Acquisition Agreement providing for the purchase of all of
the issued and outstanding shares of, and preference shares issued by, Multikino S.A. from its sellers.
The completion of the Multikino Acquisition is subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, including
receipt of approval from the Polish Competition Authority and various consents under sale and
leaseback arrangements. If the conditions are not satisfied by the Escrow Longstop Date, unless
amended, the Multikino Acquisition Agreement will terminate and the Multikino Acquisition will not be
completed.

If the Vue Acquisition is not completed on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, or upon the occurrence
of certain other events, then all of the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption, and you
will not obtain the investment return you expect on the Notes. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Escrow of
_Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.’’ If the Multikino Acquisition is not completed on or prior to_
(i) the Escrow Longstop Date, if the Vue Acquisition Completion Date has not yet occurred, or (ii) if the
Vue Acquisition Completion Date has occurred, the Extended Escrow Longstop Date, then £50.0 million
(or the equivalent) (or such lesser or greater amount as left in escrow following release in respect of the
Vue Acquisition) aggregate principal amount of the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory
redemption, and you will not obtain the investment return you expect on the Notes. In each case, the
special mandatory redemption will be a price equal to 100% of the issue price of such aggregate

59


-----

principal amount of Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from the
Issue Date to the date of special mandatory redemption. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Escrow of
_Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.’’_

Each of (i) OMERS and (ii) collectively, certain entities directed by AIMCo, will guarantee 50% each of the
interest that would accrue on the Notes from the Issue Date to the special mandatory redemption date.
However, there can be no assurance that interest and Additional Amounts, if any, accrued while the
proceeds remain in the Escrow Accounts will be paid in a timely fashion, if at all.

Your decision to invest in the Notes is made at the time of purchase. Changes in our business, results of
operations or financial condition, or the terms of the Vue Acquisition or the Multikino Acquisition or the
financing thereof, between the closing of this Offering and the completion of the Vue Acquisition or the
Multikino Acquisition, will have no effect on your rights as a purchaser of the Notes.

**_The Issuer does not currently control Vue and its subsidiaries or Multikino and will not control Vue_**
**_and its subsidiaries or Multikino until completion of the Vue Acquisition and the Multikino_**
**_Acquisition, respectively._**

Vue and its subsidiaries are currently controlled by funds controlled by Doughty Hanson. We will not
obtain control until completion of the Vue Acquisition. We cannot assure you that the funds controlled by
Doughty Hanson will operate the Vue business during the interim period in the same way that we would.
The information contained in this offering memorandum has been derived from public sources and, in
the case of historical information relating to Vue and its subsidiaries, has been provided to us by
Doughty Hanson, Vue and its subsidiaries, and we have relied on such information supplied to us in its
preparation. Further, the Transactions themselves have required, and will likely continue to require,
substantial amounts of management’s time and focus, which could adversely affect their ability to
operate the business. Likewise, other employees may be uncomfortable with the Transactions or feel
otherwise affected by them, which could have an impact on work quality and retention.

Multikino is currently controlled by its majority shareholder, International Trading and Investments
Holdings S.A. Luxembourg. We will not obtain control until completion of the Multikino Acquisition. We
cannot assure you that International Trading and Investments Holdings S.A. Luxembourg will operate
the Multikino business during the interim period in the same way that we would. The information
contained in this offering memorandum has been derived from public sources and, in the case of
historical information relating to Multikino and its subsidiaries, has been provided to us by Multikino, and
we have relied on such information supplied to us in its preparation.

In addition, prior to the Completion Date, neither Vue nor any of its subsidiaries nor Multikino nor any of
its subsidiaries will be subject to the covenants described in ‘‘Description of the Notes’’ to be included in
the Indenture. As such, we cannot assure you that, prior to such date, Vue or any of its subsidiaries or
Multikino or any of its subsidiaries will not take an action that would otherwise have been prohibited by
the Indenture had those covenants been applicable.

**THE TRANSACTIONS**

**The Vue Acquisition**

On June 9, 2013, the Issuer and Holdco entered into the Vue Acquisition Agreement to acquire the entire
issued share capital of Vue Entertainment International Limited, the preference shares of Vue Holdings
(Jersey) Limited and the loan notes issued by Vue Holdings (Jersey) Limited from DH P S.´a.r.l, the
Executive Managers and certain other senior management, among others. The completion of the Vue
Acquisition is subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, including antitrust approval by the European
Commission. We submitted our official notification to the European Commission on June 21, 2013. If
regulatory approval by the European Commission is not received by September 30, 2013, unless
amended, the Vue Acquisition Agreement will terminate. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the
_Transactions—The Vue Acquisition and the Multikino Acquisition are subject to significant uncertainties_
_and there is a risk that the conditions to the escrow will not be satisfied and we will be required to redeem_
_all or certain of the Notes, which means that you may not obtain the return you expect on the Notes.’’_

**The Multikino Acquisition**

On May 10, 2013, Eudialyte Company sp. z o.o., an entity indirectly owned by Vue Holdings (Jersey)
Limited, entered into the Multikino Acquisition Agreement to acquire the entire issued share capital of
Multikino S.A. from Multikino Holding B.V. and AP Portico Slask S.A.R.L. The completion of the Multikino
Acquisition is subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, including regulatory approval by the President
of the Polish Competition Authority. An application to the competent antitrust authority in Poland was
submitted on May 16, 2013. If the regulatory approval by the relevant antitrust authority is not received by
December 1, 2013, unless amended, the Multikino Acquisition Agreement will terminate. See ‘‘Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and Guarantees—If the conditions to the escrow are not satisfied,_
_the Issuer will be required to redeem a portion or all of the Notes, which means that you may not obtain the_
_return you expect on the Notes.’’_

**The Financing**

The equity consideration for the Vue Acquisition is £210 million and is subject to certain adjustments
specified in the Vue Acquisition Agreement. The equity consideration for the Multikino Acquisition is
e48.0 million (£40.8 million, translated into pounds sterling at an exchange rate of e1.1779 per £1.00 as
at April 4, 2013). If the Multikino Acquisition completes prior to the Vue Acquisition, the Multikino
Acquisition will be funded by Doughty Hanson (the ‘‘DH Multikino Bridge Amount’’) and upon
completion of the Vue Acquisition, a sum equivalent to the DH Multikino Bridge Amount will be paid by
the Issuer to Doughty Hanson pursuant to the terms of the Vue Acquisition Agreement. It is expected that
the Vue Acquisition and the Multikino Acquisition will be financed through:

- Issuer Share Subscription Amount;

- the Issuer Loan;

- the Bridge Loan;

- the proceeds of Offering; and

- depending on the timing of the Vue Acquisition Completion Date, drawings under the Revolving
Credit Facility.

The proceeds from the financing described above will be used to:

- fund the consideration payable for the entire issued share capital of Vue Entertainment International
Limited;

- fund the consideration payable for the entire issued share capital of Multikino S.A.;

- fund the consideration payable for all the preference shares of Vue Holdings (Jersey) Limited;

- fund the consideration payable for all the loan notes issued by Vue Holdings (Jersey) Limited;

- repay the remaining outstanding amounts of the shareholder bridge loan as at the Vue Acquisition
Completion Date;

- repay remaining outstanding amounts of the Existing Bank Facility as at the Vue Acquisition
Completion Date;

61


-----

- repay the remaining outstanding amounts of the existing working capital facility as at the Vue
Acquisition Completion Date;

- repay certain indebtedness of Multikino as at the Multikino Acquisition Completion Date; and

- pay certain fees and expenses in connection with certain of the Transactions, including estimated
fees and expenses to be incurred in connection with the Offering.

**_Release of proceeds from escrow_**

Pending the completion of the Vue Acquisition, the gross proceeds of the Offering will be deposited into
the Escrow Accounts in the name of the Issuer but controlled by, and pledged on a first-ranking basis in
favor of the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes, pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. The release
of the escrow proceeds will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The Escrow Agreement
will provide that £499.4 million (or the equivalent) of the proceeds of the Notes will be released upon the
Vue Acquisition Completion Date in order to fund such acquisition and £50.0 million (or the equivalent) of
the proceeds will be released upon the Multikino Acquisition Completion Date, if such date occurs after
the completion of the Vue Acquisition, otherwise the Vue Acquisition Completion Date. See ‘‘Description
_of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.’’ The completion of both_
acquisitions is subject to certain conditions, including regulatory approvals. If the Vue Acquisition is not
completed on or prior to (i) the Escrow Longstop Date, if the Vue Acquisition Completion Date has not
yet occurred, or (ii) if the Vue Acquisition Completion Date has occurred, the Extended Escrow Longstop
Date, or upon the occurrence of certain other events, then all of the Notes will be subject to a special
mandatory redemption. If the Multikino Acquisition is not completed on or prior to the Escrow Longstop
Date, or upon the occurrence of certain other events, then £50.0 million (or the equivalent) (or such
lesser or greater amount as left in escrow following release in respect of the Vue Acquisition) aggregate
principal amount of the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption. The special mandatory
redemption will be at a price equal to 100% of the issue price of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to the date of special mandatory redemption.
See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.’’

We refer to the Vue Acquisition, the Multikino Acquisition, the Financing, the Offering, the entering into
the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the entering into the Security Documents and the Intercreditor
Agreement and the other transactions contemplated thereby, including the repayment of existing
indebtedness and payment of fees and expenses, together, as the ‘‘Transactions.’’ See ‘‘Use of
_Proceeds,’’ ‘‘Capitalization’’ and ‘‘Description of the Notes.’’_

62


-----

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We expect the gross proceeds from the Offering will be £549.4 million. The gross proceeds will be
deposited into the Escrow Accounts in the name of the Issuer but will be controlled by, and pledged on a
first-ranking basis in favor of, the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes, pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement. The release of the escrow proceeds will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.
The Escrow Agreement will provide that £499.4 million (or the equivalent) of the proceeds of the Notes
will be released upon the Vue Acquisition Completion Date and £50.0 million (or the equivalent) (or such
lesser or greater amount as left in escrow following the release in respect of the Vue Acquisition) of such
proceeds of the Notes will be released upon the Multikino Acquisition Completion Date, if such date
occurs after the Vue Acquisition Completion Date, otherwise the Vue Acquisition Completion Date. See
‘‘Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.’’

The expected estimated sources and uses of the funds necessary to complete the Transactions are
shown in the below table as if they had occurred as at April 4, 2013. Actual amounts will vary from
estimated amounts depending on several factors, including differences from our estimate of existing
cash in the business, our estimates of the cost of repaying the existing indebtedness described below,
differences from our estimates of fees and expenses and the ultimate timing of the Vue Acquisition
Completion Date and the Multikino Acquisition Completion Date.

(1) In the event that the Vue Acquisition Completion Date does not take place on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, or if
certain other events occur or fail to occur, all of the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption. In the event that
the Multikino Acquisition Completion Date does not take place on or prior to (i) the Escrow Longstop Date, if the Vue
Acquisition Completion Date has not yet occurred, or (ii) if the Vue Acquisition Completion Date has occurred, the Extended
Escrow Longstop Date, then £50.0 million (or the equivalent) (or such lesser or greater amount as left in escrow following
release in respect of the Vue Acquisition) aggregate principal amount of the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory
redemption. In each case, the special mandatory redemption price will be equal to 100% of the aggregate issue price of the
Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to the date of the
special mandatory redemption. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.’’ The
Floating Rate Notes have been translated into pounds sterling at an exchange rate of e1.15693 per £1.00 based on the
Bloomberg rate on July 10, 2013. The Floating Rate Notes are stated net of an original issue discount of 0.5%.

(2) Represents the Revolving Credit Facility that the Issuer will enter into on or about the Issue Date in the amount of
£50.0 million. Depending on the timing of the Vue Acquisition Completion Date, the Issuer may draw on the Revolving Credit
Facility up to approximately £15.0 million for working capital purposes and may continue to utilize the Revolving Credit
Facility going forward. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility.’’

(3) Represents the equity of approximately £4.7 million contributed to the Issuer by Midco by way of share subscription, the
proceeds for which will have been advanced to Midco from Finco through an intercompany loan and/or share subscription.
The proceeds that Finco will provide to Midco will have been advanced to Finco by way of share subscription by Holdco and/
or intercompany loan from Holdco and/or the issuance of the Loan Notes.

(4) Represents the loan of up to £433 million extended to the Issuer by Midco, pursuant to shareholder loan agreements
between the Issuer and Midco, on or prior to the Vue Acquisition Completion Date. See ‘‘Certain Relationships and Related
_Party Transactions—Issuer Loan.’’_

(5) Represents the loan of £34.1 million extended to the Issuer by Midco, pursuant to a shareholder loan agreement between the
Issuer and Midco, on or prior to the Vue Acquisition Completion Date, the proceeds of which will have been advanced to
Midco from Finco through an intercompany loan and/or share subscription. The proceeds that Finco will provide to Midco
will have been advanced to Finco pursuant to the issuance of the Bridge Loan Notes. See ‘‘Certain Relationships and Related
_Party Transactions—Bridge Loan.’’_

(6) Represents the equity consideration as set out in the Vue Acquisition Agreement. See ‘‘The Transactions—The Financing.’’

(7) Represents, as at April 4, 2013, amounts drawn on our existing working capital facility and the Existing Bank Facility, as well
as amounts owed to existing shareholders in the form of preference shares, subordinated loan notes issued and the
shareholder bridge loan, including accrued interest to April 4, 2013.

(8) Represents the equity consideration of e48.0 million as set out in the Multikino Acquisition Agreement, translated into pounds
sterling at an exchange rate of e1.1779 per £1.00. See ‘‘The Transactions—The Financing.’’

(9) Represents a portion of Multikino’s existing indebtedness including bond, capital leases and bank borrowings together with
accrued interest to and other redemption costs as at March 31, 2013, translated into pounds sterling at an exchange rate of
PLN 4.9529 per £1.00.

(10) Represents the estimated transaction fees and expenses, including fees and commissions, financing fees, advisory fees and
other transaction costs and professional fees including fees and expenses of £15.7 million relating to the Vue Acquisition,
£1.8 million relating to the Multikino Acquisition and £17.5 million relating to the issue of the Notes and the Revolving Credit
Facility.

(11) In the event that the Multikino Acquisition is not completed, £50.0 million (or the equivalent) (or such lesser or greater amount
as left in escrow following release in respect of the Vue Acquisition) in aggregate principal amount of the Notes will be subject
to a special mandatory redemption, and based on the estimated sources and uses of funds as at April 4, 2013 the Issuer Loan
would be reduced by £28.4 million and the estimated transaction fees and expenses would be reduced by £2.7 million. The
Multikino Acquisition purchase price of £40.8 million and the repayment of the existing Multikino indebtedness of
£37.7 million would not be incurred.

(12) In the event that the Multikino Acquisition is completed prior to the Vue Acquisition Completion Date, the Multikino
Acquisition purchase price will be funded by a loan from Doughty Hanson, and upon completion of the Vue Acquisition, a
sum equivalent to that loan will be paid by the Issuer to Doughty Hanson pursuant to the terms of the Vue Acquisition
Agreement. Based on the anticipated sources and uses of funds as at April 4, 2013, the loan from Doughty Hanson would
represent the Multikino Acquisition price of £40.8 million together with the repayment of the existing Multikino indebtedness
of £37.7 million as shown in the table above.

(1) Cash at bank and in hand as at April 4, 2013 has been adjusted to include cash and cash equivalents of Multikino as at
March 31, 2013 of £0.9 million and the cash used to give pro forma effect to the Transactions including the application of the
proceeds therefrom and does not reflect any cash generated by our business since April 4, 2013.

(2) Certain cash at bank and in hand amounting to the equivalent of £34.1 million in euros at the Issue Date will be retained in
CinemaxX until the completion of the Squeeze Out and the German Company Conversion, after which it will be used to repay
the Bridge Loan.

(3) In connection with the Transactions, we will repay the Existing Bank Facility, drawings under the existing working capital
facility and certain borrowings of Multikino. The Existing Bank Facility is stated gross of £14.0 million of capitalized issue
costs.

(4) The Notes are stated gross of £17.5 million of estimated capitalized issue costs and do not take into account that the Notes
will be issued with original issue discount. For the purposes of this presentation, the aggregate principal amount of the
Floating Rate Notes has been converted into pounds sterling at an exchange rate of e1.15693 per £1.00 based on the
Bloomberg rate on July 10, 2013.

(5) Loan from the German Federal Film Board. See ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
_of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Contractual obligations and commitments.’’_

(6) The Issuer expects to enter into the Revolving Credit Facility in connection with the Offering. Depending on the timing of the
Vue Acquisition Completion Date, the Issuer may draw up to approximately £15.0 million of the Revolving Credit Facility at the
Vue Acquisition Completion Date for working capital purposes.

(7) Represents the Issuer Loan and the Bridge Loan, each of which will be extended to the Issuer by Midco, pursuant to
shareholder loan agreements and the Bridge Loan Agreement, respectively, on or prior to the Vue Acquisition Completion
Date. See ‘‘Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Issuer Loan’’ and ‘‘Certain Relationships and Related Party
_Transactions—Bridge Loan.’’_

(8) Capital and reserves consist of called up share capital, share premium, profit and loss account and minority interest. The pro
forma capital and reserves includes £4.7 million which represents the Issuer Share Subscription Amount.

(9) We have entered into interest rate swaps as described in ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
_Results of Operation—Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosure about Market an Operating Risk—Interest Rate Risk.’’ The mark-_
to-market value of these hedging arrangements as at June 30, 2013 was a liability of approximately £2.8 million. We may
choose to crystallize the liability due to our hedging counterparties at the Vue Acquisition Completion Date, but we expect
currently to roll these interest rate swaps over and incur any costs over the period to the expiry of each relevant contract.

(3) EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, EBITDAR and Adjusted EBITDAR are supplemental measures of our
financial and operating performance used by management that are not required by, or prepared in accordance with,
U.K. GAAP or IFRS. These measures are prepared by management because we believe they provide a view of our recurring
operating performance that is unaffected by our capital structure and allows management to readily view operating trends
and identify strategies to improve operating performance.

We believe our EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, EBITDAR and Adjusted EBITDAR measures are useful
to investors because they are the bases for comparing our performance with the performance of other companies in the
same or similar industries, although our measure may not be directly comparable to other measures used by other
companies. We encourage you to review our financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.
See ‘‘Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Other Financial Measures’’ for an explanation of certain limitations to
the use of these measures.

For a reconciliation of each of these measures to our Consolidated Financial Statements, see ‘‘Summary
_Historical and Pro Forma Combined Financial Information and Operating Data.’’_

**UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

The unaudited pro forma combined financial information presented below has been derived from the
Consolidated Financial Statements, the special purpose consolidated financial statements of Multikino,
the pre-acquisition consolidated financial information of CinemaxX for the period April 1, 2012 to July 31,
2012, adjusted to give pro forma effect to (i) IFRS to U.K. GAAP differences, (ii) the Vue Acquisition,
(iii) the Multikino Acquisition, (iv) the Financing, and the application of the proceeds therefrom; and are
prepared in accordance with the basis of preparation as described in the notes to the unaudited pro
forma combined financial information. See ‘‘Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Pro Forma
_Financial Information.’’ For purposes of this unaudited pro forma combined financial information, the_
Transactions are deemed to have occurred on April 4, 2013.

The assumptions underlying the above pro forma adjustments are described in the notes presented
herein. Both the Vue Acquisition and Multikino Acquisition will be accounted for by using the acquisition
method of accounting, which requires determination of the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities
as of the closing date of each acquisition, and allocation of the purchase price based on such fair values.
As of the date of this offering memorandum, in respect of the Vue Acquisition and the Multikino
Acquisition, we have not performed the valuation studies necessary to estimate the fair values of the
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the related allocation of the purchase price. The
purchase price allocation in respect of the Vue Acquisition and the Multikino Acquisition may result in
significant adjustments to the historical values of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
and other assets, liabilities and provisions, resulting in a significant increase in depreciation and
amortization expense. See Note 1(e) to the unaudited pro forma combined income statement and
Note 2(b) to the unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet in ‘‘Unaudited Pro Forma Combined
_Financial Information’’ for a further discussion of the purchase price allocation and its impact on our_
financial position and results.

The unaudited pro forma combined financial information has not been prepared in accordance with the
requirements of Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities Act, the Prospectus Directive or any generally
accepted accounting standards. The unaudited pro forma adjustments are based upon available
information and certain assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Neither the assumptions
underlying the pro forma adjustments nor the resulting unaudited pro forma combined financial
information have been audited or reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted auditing
standards.

The unaudited pro forma combined financial information is for informational purposes only and should
not be considered indicative of actual results that would have been achieved had the Transactions been
completed on the dates indicated and do not purport to indicate our future consolidated results of
operations or financial position. The actual results may differ significantly from those reflected in the
unaudited pro forma combined financial information for a number of reasons, including, but not limited
to, differences in assumptions used to prepare the unaudited pro forma combined financial information.

The unaudited pro forma combined financial information should be read in conjunction with the
information contained in ‘‘Selected Historical Financial Information,’’ ‘‘Management’s Discussion and
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,’’ the Consolidated Financial Statements, the_
consolidated financial statements of Multikino, and the consolidated financial statements of CinemaxX
appearing elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

2(a) Certain reclassifications have been made to the Multikino balance sheet as at March 31, 2013 to
present it following Vue’s balance sheet presentation. The balance sheet has been translated
from złoty to pounds sterling at an exchange rate of £0.2019 to PLN 1.00.

2(b)(i) Represents the allocation of the preliminary purchase price for the Vue Acquisition.

-----

The unaudited pro forma combined financial information reflects the estimated purchase
consideration of £210 million for Vue.

The cost of acquisition is dependent on the actual direct purchase consideration. Under the
acquisition method of accounting, the total estimated cost of acquisition is allocated to Vue’s net
tangible and intangible assets based on their estimated fair values as at the date of completion of
the acquisition. For the purposes of the unaudited pro forma combined financial information, we
have assumed that the book value of tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed
approximates fair value. Such allocation may change based on our final analysis of such fair
values, as described below. Based on our estimated cost of acquisition and our preliminary
valuation, our purchase price allocation is as follows:

**(£ in**

**Goodwill arising on acquisition . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **684,410**

Goodwill represents the excess of the estimated purchase price over the estimated preliminary
fair value of the net assets acquired and will be amortized over a period of 20 years. The
preliminary purchase price allocation for Vue is subject to revision as more detailed analysis is
completed and additional information on the fair values of Vue’s assets and liabilities become
available, which is required to be completed in its financial period ended November 27, 2014. Any
change in fair value of the net assets of Vue will change the amount of goodwill. Final purchase
accounting adjustments may therefore differ materially from the pro forma adjustments presented
here.

2(b)(ii)Represents the allocation of the preliminary purchase price for the Multikino Acquisition.

The unaudited pro forma combined financial information reflects the estimated purchase
consideration of e48 million (£40.8 million) for Multikino.

The cost of acquisition is dependent on the actual direct purchase consideration. Under the
acquisition method of accounting, the total estimated cost of acquisition is allocated to Multikino’s
net tangible and intangible assets based on their estimated fair values as at the date of
completion of the acquisition. For the purposes of the unaudited pro forma combined financial
information, we have assumed that the book value of tangible assets acquired and liabilities
assumed approximates fair value. Such allocation may change based on our final analysis of

**Goodwill arising on acquisition . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **7,497**

Goodwill represents the excess of the estimated purchase price over the estimated preliminary

preliminary purchase price allocation for Multikino is subject to revision as more detailed analysis
is completed and additional information on the fair values of Multikino’s assets and liabilities
become available, which is required to be completed in our financial period ended November 27,
2014. Any change in fair value of the net assets of Multikino will change the amount of goodwill.
Final purchase accounting adjustments may therefore differ materially from the pro forma

_This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that are subject to known and unknown_
_risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those_
_expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those_
_discussed below and elsewhere in this offering memorandum, particularly under the headings ‘‘Forward-_
_looking statements’’ and ‘‘Risk Factors.’’ We do not undertake any obligation to revise or publicly release_
_the results of any revision to these forward-looking statements._

**Overview**

We believe we are Europe’s second largest cinema operator by number of screens with operations
predominantly in the United Kingdom and Germany. We have grown our portfolio through a combination
of new cinema developments and acquisitions of cinemas in the United Kingdom and internationally. We
currently operate 115 cinemas with 1,072 screens located across six countries. In addition, we have
recently entered into an agreement to acquire Multikino, the second-largest cinema operator in Poland
by number of screens. After the completion of the Multikino Acquisition, we will operate 145 cinemas
with 1,318 screens located across nine countries.

We believe our cinema portfolio in the United Kingdom represents the newest, most modern chain of
cinemas in the country. In the United Kingdom, 98% of our cinemas are multiplexes, 94% have stadium
seating and all are fully digital. We also recently completed the acquisition of Apollo in the United
Kingdom to strengthen our position in the United Kingdom and to take advantage of certain economies
of scale. After disposing of five cinemas with 27 screens, the Apollo acquisition added nine cinemas with
56 screens to our portfolio, all of which have stadium seating and are fully digital, modern multiplexes. In
the United Kingdom, all of our cinemas use Sony Digital Cinema 4K digital projection technology, which
provides eight times the resolution of 2K digital projectors. We have a broad reach in the United Kingdom
and we estimate that over 60% of the population lives within a 30-minute drive of a Vue cinema.
According to Rentrak/EDI, our GBOR market share in the United Kingdom was approximately 24% for
the year ended December 31, 2012. We operate six of the top 20 grossing box office cinemas in the
United Kingdom, with a strong presence in the key London and West End markets, including our
Westfield London site which was the highest grossing box office cinema in the United Kingdom for the 53
weeks ended April 4, 2013.

We have leveraged our strong operational knowledge and experience with successful integrations of
acquisitions, primarily in the United Kingdom, to enter new European markets through selective strategic
acquisitions of leading cinema operators. These European markets are generally more fragmented and
less developed than the United Kingdom and we believe they offer opportunities for consolidation and
growth. In August 2012, we established our presence in Germany and Denmark through the acquisition
of CinemaxX, Germany’s second largest cinema operator by number of screens. Our cinemas in
Germany are typically situated in premium city center locations within the 20 largest German cities where
population densities are highest. We believe that all of our German cinemas offer state-of-the-art facilities
and, after completion of our digital rollout program by the end of July 2013, all of our cinemas in
Germany will have 4K digital projection technology. We also are seeking to expand into Poland, Latvia
and Lithuania through the acquisition of Poland’s second largest cinema operator by number of screens,
Multikino. Approximately 97% of Multikino’s cinemas are multiplexes and all are fully digital. In addition,

82


-----

we operate a 14-screen cinema in Dublin, Ireland, a 9-screen cinema in Faro, Portugal and a 16-screen
cinema in Taipei, Taiwan, each of which is a multiplex cinema and has stadium seating.

On a pro forma basis, assuming the CinemaxX Acquisition and Multikino Acquisition had occurred on
April 5, 2012, our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA for the 53 weeks ended April 4, 2013 would have been
£588.0 million and £110.3 million, respectively. In addition, we would have had approximately
67.1 million admissions to our cinemas for the 53 weeks ended April 4, 2013. See ‘‘Unaudited Pro Forma
_Combined Financial Information.’’_

**_Geographic segments_**

We account for our operations in three main geographic segments:

- the United Kingdom (which includes our U.K. business as well as Apollo, which was acquired in
May 2012 and consolidated from May 10, 2012);

- Continental Europe, which includes our Irish and Portuguese businesses, CinemaxX in Germany
and Denmark, which was acquired in 2012, and consolidated from August 7, 2012 and, following
the completion of the Multikino Acquisition, will include operations in Poland, Latvia and Lithuania.
In operational terms, our Irish business is managed and operated as part of our U.K. business, but
as a euro-denominated territory, Ireland is included within Continental Europe for accounting and
financial purposes; and

- other markets, which represents our business in Taiwan.

As at and for the 18 weeks ended April 4, 2013, the United Kingdom, Continental Europe and other
markets represented 57.5%, 41.1% and 1.4% of our revenue and had (net liabilities)/net assets of
£(248.4) million, £164.8 million and £(0.3) million, respectively. As at and for the 53 weeks ended
November 29, 2012, the United Kingdom, Continental Europe and other markets represented 79.6%,
18.6% and 1.8% of our revenue and had (net liabilities)/net assets of £(151.4) million, £80.3 million and
£(0.4) million, respectively. For further information regarding our revenue by geographic segment, see
note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements.

**_Current Trading_**

For the 18 weeks ended April 4, 2013, we generated revenue of £186.5 million, EBITDA of £33.7 million
and had total admissions of 19.6 million. Although our full results for the 26 weeks ended May 30, 2013
have not yet been completed, based on our management accounts for the 26 weeks ended May 30,
2013, we expect to report revenue of approximately £263 million and EBITDA of approximately
£48 million (excluding Multikino). In addition, we estimate our total admissions for the 26 weeks ended
May 30, 2013 were 27.5 million (excluding Multikino). These results reflect a relatively slow period in April
across the industry, primarily as a result of a weaker film slate as compared to earlier in the year, followed
by stronger performance in May driven principally by recent popular releases such as Iron Man 3, Star
_Trek Into Darkness and Fast & Furious 6. We generally have experienced stronger performance in the_
second half of our financial year.

The above preliminary estimates are based on our management accounts which are principally
prepared in accordance with U.K. GAAP and are not intended to be a comprehensive statement of our
financial or operational results for the 26 weeks ended May 30, 2013. These preliminary estimates were
prepared based on a number of assumptions and judgments and, as a result, reflect a certain level of
uncertainty and are subject to revision. Our actual results for the 26 weeks ended May 30, 2013 may vary
from these preliminary estimates, and such variations could be material. See ‘‘Forward-Looking
_Statements’’ and ‘‘Risk Factors’’ in this offering memorandum for a discussion of various factors which_
could affect our future performance and results of operations.

**Principal factors affecting results of operations and financial performance**

**_Box Office Revenues_**

The largest component of our total consolidated revenue is box office revenue. Our box office revenue is
a function of our average net ticket price and total admissions. Our average net ticket price, total
admissions, which comprises both paid and unpaid admissions, and certain other key operational data,
are presented below for the periods indicated.

_Average Ticket Prices_

Our ticket pricing levels vary by cinema location and other variables including time of day, day of the
week and type of customer for each film, resulting in higher ticket prices in certain circumstances and in
increased use of discounts in others. Premium offerings in the United Kingdom, such as VIP seats, Vue
Xtreme screens and 3D film offerings also serve to increase average ticket prices. While targeted
discounts such as ‘‘Super Saver Tuesdays,’’ ‘‘Orange Wednesdays’’ and the ‘‘Kids AM’’ programs
reduce average ticket prices, we believe these discounts boost total admissions volume and therefore
overall box office revenue. Premium offerings in Germany such as surcharges for 3D films, longer films
and blockbusters, plus seat location surcharges, have also served to increase average ticket prices.
CinemaxX generally benefits from German cinemas having higher average ticket prices than in the
United Kingdom, and as a result our group average ticket price has increased since the acquisition of
CinemaxX in August 2012.

The film slate of available movies in a given period also affects our box office revenue and average ticket
prices through variations in the mix of different ticket types sold. Certain films tend to attract an adult
audience that will purchase higher-priced adult tickets, whereas other films are intended for children or
seniors, whose tickets are sold at a discount as compared to standard adult tickets. Certain films are also
more likely to be shown in formats which enhance revenue, such as 3D or Vue Xtreme.

We recently introduced a strategic ticket price restructuring in the United Kingdom, following a series of
detailed trials at test sites. This strategic ticket price restructuring has had the effect of increasing
non-peak prices significantly, and we believe should produce revenue benefits going forward.

_Total Admissions_

Our total admissions are substantially affected by the quality and success of the films we offer, and
seasonal and other factors, each as explained further in the factors below. The number of cinemas and
screens we operate also affects our total admissions. We have increased the number of cinemas and
screens we operate from 66 cinemas featuring 643 screens as at November 28, 2008 to 116 cinemas
featuring 1,075 screens as at April 4, 2013. We have achieved this growth organically by opening six new
cinemas with 66 new screens since November 28, 2008 and through acquisitions, most recently of
Apollo (which ultimately added a net nine cinemas and 56 screens) and CinemaxX (which added 34
cinemas and 292 screens). This increase in the number of cinemas and screens has contributed to

84


-----

growth in our total admissions from 35.8 million for the 52 weeks ended November 26, 2009 to
45.0 million for the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012, which is partly attributable to our acquisitions of
the Acquired Businesses during 2012. Following the completion of the Multikino Acquisition, we expect
our total cinemas will increase by 30 and our total screens will increase by 246.

_Film Quality and Success_

The unexpected emergence of a successful film, or the failure of an expected success, can lead to
volatility in our box office revenue across financial periods. Our results are therefore dependent on the
film slate and popularity of the films released in a given period, which in turn depends on production from
the movie industry and local content in each country. Consequently, we are dependent upon the degree
to which successful productions are released by major U.S. studios, the British film industry and the film
industry in Germany. For example, in the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012 a relatively poor summer
period with a weak slate of films was followed by the release of the record-breaking Bond film Skyfall,
which provided a strong end to the financial year. Some of the volatility inherent in the slate of films has
historically been smoothed by the release of successful film franchises.

**_Seasonal and Other Factors_**

Our revenue has historically been affected by the following seasonal and other factors:

_Distribution release schedules._ Generally, the major film distributors release the films they expect to be
most successful during holiday periods, concentrated particularly in the summer months and around the
Christmas holidays. The timing of such film releases has had, and is expected to continue to have, a
significant effect on our results of operations, and the results of one quarter are therefore not necessarily
indicative of results for the next quarter or for the same period in the following year.

_Weather._ Weather and weather forecasts may also influence attendance levels and directly affect our
revenue. In general, rainy or otherwise inclement weather tends to positively impact admissions. The
onset of sunny weather after a gloomy period can reduce attendance for a short period of time, as some
potential customers pursue outdoor leisure activities instead of visiting the cinema. For example,
according to the Met Office, 2011 was the warmest and driest spring in the United Kingdom in 100 years,
which we believe adversely impacted attendance generated by films that were competing with the
unseasonably warm weather. Less frequently, extremely poor weather conditions, such as winter snow
storms that result in road closures or limited public transportation options may also reduce our
admissions figures. December 2010 was, according to the Met Office, the coldest December in the
United Kingdom for 100 years, producing early and severe snowfall which impacted box office revenues
from high-profile films released during the holiday season. Furthermore, the impact of weather on
attendance can be particularly positive or negative if the relevant weather coincides with the opening
weekend of a significant release, as a substantial portion of a film’s box office revenue is typically earned
in its opening weekend.

_Competing entertainment or unexpected events._ Major social, political, cultural or sporting events
impact our revenue to the extent that they reduce total admissions. Although film distributors attempt to
take such events into account when scheduling film releases, the specific timing of major events can still
have an impact on total admissions. For example, the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games took place
in London, where we generate a significant portion of our revenue, and led to a reduction in admissions
in London and other cinemas for the duration of the Games. Additionally, the rioting that took place in
London and other U.K. cities during the summer of 2011 led to lower attendance and revenue than would
otherwise have been expected during the summer season.

**_Concessions_**

Concession sales form the second largest source of our revenue. Concession revenue is impacted by
the types and length of films which we play, the exhibition format and general economic conditions. For
example, in some geographic markets, longer films are shown with intermissions, which generally
benefits concession sales. In addition, we believe certain types of films, for example superhero films
such as Iron Man or The Avengers, generally attract customers who are more likely than others to spend
on concessions. We believe that price conscious customers who purchase discount tickets are also
more likely to spend less on concessions.

85


-----

General economic conditions are also a factor as these impact consumer spending patterns, including
the proportion of customers who are attracted to discount tickets. Although attendance levels have
remained relatively stable, including during the most recent economic downturn, concession volumes
across the industry appear to have been adversely affected as consumers have less discretionary
income due to the current economic climate.

The cost of sales we incur for concession sales varies by product type, but in general concession
revenue tends to have strong margins. We seek to manage our concessions costs by negotiating prices
for our products directly with suppliers in each market.

**_Screen Advertising Revenue_**

Screen advertising revenue generally varies depending on the type of films screened, the minutes and
value of advertising sold, the number of attendees who view the film, and the placement of the
advertisement in relation to the start time of the film. Screen advertising revenues are generally more
directly correlated to the overall economic environment as compared to, for instance, admission
volumes. Under our contractual arrangements, our advertising revenues have a minimal amount of cost
of sales associated with them, resulting in an enhanced benefit to our profitability when screen
advertising income increases.

**_Operating Margins_**

Our ability to maintain operating margins as we increase total admissions and revenue depends upon
the success of strategies aimed at optimizing the relationship between average ticket prices and total
admission volumes, while increasing customers’ average spend on concession items, and managing
our staff and film rental expenses. In addition to the average ticket prices achieved by a given film, a
film’s profitability for us also depends on the margins we achieve between tickets sold and the film rental
costs we pay to distributors. The film license agreements we negotiate with distributors are the single
largest component of our expenses, and are negotiated on a film-by-film basis, and as a result the
percentage of box office revenue that is paid to film distributors will vary, depending on the expected
quality of the film and the period during which it is shown in our cinemas.

Certain of our expenses vary, according to total admissions and levels of box office revenue. Our film
rental costs, for example, are calculated with reference to box office revenue, and therefore a significant
portion of our costs tends to decrease during periods of low admissions. We also manage our staff costs
in order to match, to the extent possible, staffing levels with admissions levels. For example, we have the
ability to reduce the operating hours of our cinemas during quiet periods, thus reducing staff costs and
utility costs. We also have the ability to manage discretionary costs, such as marketing, non-essential
expenses and supplies, and the timing of certain repair and maintenance expenses, so that these cost
outlays are in line with admission volumes.

Certain of our expenses do not vary with admissions or box office revenues. For example, property
rentals (excluding turnover rents), depreciation and amortisation are generally costs that are not
influenced by changes in levels of admissions or box office revenues. We endeavor to mitigate the risk to
financial performance from low attendance by generating revenues from non-film sources such as
screening of alternative content and hiring our facilities for conferences. In addition, we apply a rigorous
approach to property management so as to optimize our negotiation of rents, property leases and costs
of new cinema sites.

**_Doughty Hanson Acquisition_**

We were acquired by Doughty Hanson at the end of 2010. This acquisition was funded by £255 million of
senior debt plus £223 million of shareholder loans and equity. As a result, our consolidated results of
operations for the 49 trading weeks ended November 24, 2011 and for the 53 weeks ended
November 29, 2012 reflect significant interest charges and amortization of goodwill charges relating to
the Doughty Hanson acquisition.

**_Foreign Currency Fluctuations and Translation_**

We operate internationally and are exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations arising from various
currency exposures primarily with respect to pounds sterling and the euro. After the completion of the
Multikino Acquisition, we will also be exposed to fluctuations of both pounds sterling and euros against

86


-----

the Polish złoty, Latvia lats and Lithuanian litas. As a result, our reported results of operations and
financial condition are affected by exchange rate fluctuations due to both transaction and, more
significantly, translation risk. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and the Industry—
_Fluctuations in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations.’’_

Transaction risk arises when our subsidiaries execute transactions in a currency other than their
functional currency. On a consolidated basis, we consider the Group’s transaction foreign exchange risk
to be low, primarily because each of our geographic segments receive revenue and incur most
expenses in their functional currencies, and thus benefit from a natural hedge. Going forward, after the
completion of the Multikino Acquisition, our operations in Poland, Latvia and Lithuania will be subject to
transaction risk as a result of receiving revenue in złoty, lats and litas, respectively, while paying property
rental costs in euros.

Translation risk arises because the Group prepares its consolidated financial statements in pounds
sterling whereas our subsidiaries operating outside the United Kingdom prepare their financial
statements in currencies other than pounds sterling. We are therefore exposed to translation risk on the
preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements when we translate the financial statements of our
subsidiaries which have a functional currency other than pounds sterling. Translation risk in our
operations to date has exposed us to fluctuations in the value of pounds sterling as compared to the
euro and, to a limited extent, against the new Taiwan dollar and Danish Krone. Going forward, after the
completion of the Multikino Acquisition, our operations in Poland, Latvia and Lithuania will subject us to
translation risk as a result of their financial statements being prepared in złoty, lats and litas, respectively.
We will be exposed to risk in the translation of lats and litas to złoty, and the translation of złoty to pounds
sterling, in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Given our increasing focus on markets outside the United Kingdom, we expect the translation effect of
exchange rate fluctuations on our reported results of operations to increase over time. We do not
currently hedge our foreign currency exposure.

For further discussion of the effects of fluctuations in the pounds sterling to euro and other relevant
foreign exchange rates, see ‘‘—Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosure about Market and Operating
_Risk—Foreign exchange risk’’ below._

**Factors Affecting Comparability**

**_Financial Periods_**

Our financial statements are generally prepared for either a 52- or 53-week period ending on a Thursday
within one week of November 30, which results in financial years which have either 52 or 53 weeks. Our
consolidated balance sheet as at November 24, 2011 and our consolidated profit and loss account and
cash flow statement for the period from incorporation of Vue Entertainment International Limited on
October 26, 2010 to November 24, 2011 include our trading results from December 21, 2010 (the date
upon which it indirectly acquired 100% of the ordinary shares of Vue Entertainment Investment Limited).
As a result, our consolidated profit and loss account and cash flow statement for the period ended
November 24, 2011 included in this offering memorandum refer to the 56 weeks from October 26, 2010
but actually only include trading results for 49 weeks.

Accordingly, our results for the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012, the 49 trading weeks ended
November 24, 2011 and the 52 weeks ended November 25, 2010 are not directly comparable to one
another.

**_Effects of the Acquired Businesses on our historical Consolidated Financial Statements_**

We have recently undertaken significant acquisitions in both our United Kingdom and Continental
Europe geographic segments. These acquisitions were financed by bridging loans of £16.5 million and
e94.9 million (including the Doughty Hanson cash bridge mentioned below) provided by our current
shareholders, plus a e90.0 million standalone term loan facility, all of which were repaid at the time of the
refinancing of our bank loans on December 17, 2012, with the exception of the Doughty Hanson
e30 million cash bridge loan (plus attributable interest), which will be repaid on the Vue Acquisition
Completion Date.

87


-----

Specifically:

- effective May 10, 2012, we acquired Apollo Cinemas Limited in the United Kingdom, and we
currently operate nine of Apollo’s cinemas;

- effective August 7, 2012, we acquired 30 cinemas in Germany and three cinemas in Denmark upon
our purchase of a 91.34% stake in CinemaxX, Germany’s second largest cinema operator by
number of screens. As at April 4, 2013, we held 97.47% of the ordinary shares of CinemaxX. We
expect to acquire the remaining ordinary shares of CinemaxX from the minority shareholders later in
2013, and have set aside sufficient funds to acquire the remaining ordinary shares at the initial offer
price of e6.45 per share. Once complete, this acquisition will have the effect of increasing the level of
goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet and, consequently, incurring a higher level of
amortization charges going forward. Upon acquisition of the remaining ordinary shares of
CinemaxX, we will also no longer need to account for the related minority interest on our
consolidated income statement; and

- effective January 1, 2013, CinemaxX acquired a cinema in Raschplatz, Germany which it had
previously managed that added 10 screens to our portfolio.

Since acquiring the Acquired Businesses, we have been actively integrating them into the existing
corporate, operational and financial structures of Vue in order to share best practices and identify and
realize synergies where possible. These integration initiatives relate to, among other things, our financial
reporting procedures, property management and revenue enhancing capital expenditure processes as
well as overall cinema operations.

Our consolidated profit and loss account for the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012 includes the
results of operations of the Acquired Businesses since their respective dates of acquisition, and our
consolidated balance sheet at November 29, 2012 includes the financial position of the Acquired
Businesses in full. As a result, our financial statements as at and for the 53 weeks ended November 29,
2012 vary significantly from those of earlier periods.

Assuming the completion of the Multikino Acquisition (see ‘‘The Transactions—The Multikino
_Acquisition’’), our consolidated results for the 52 weeks ended November 28, 2013 will reflect a full year_
of consolidated results of the Acquired Businesses and the partial results of Multikino from the date of
the completion of the Multikino Acquisition. In addition, our results may be affected by other items,
particularly our ability to realize synergies, including through improved efficiencies at cinemas and
roll-out of Vue’s best practices in relation to film scheduling and pricing across the larger group,
reconfiguration of our newly acquired cinemas, reduction of central and administrative costs, and
procurement synergies from expenditures on building multiplex facilities. As a result, due to the
acquisitions of the Acquired Businesses and Multikino, our financial statements in the future will vary
significantly from the historical Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this offering
memorandum.

At the date of this offering memorandum, the acquisition accounting in respect of the Vue Acquisition
and the Multikino Acquisition has not been calculated, and therefore has not been reflected in the
Consolidated Financial Statements. Acquisition accounting will require us to determine the fair values of
identifiable assets and liabilities as at the closing date of each acquisition, with the difference between
the sum of these fair values and the cost of the acquisition being recognized as goodwill in our
consolidated balance sheet. This valuation exercise in respect of the Multikino Acquisition and the Vue
Acquisition may result in significant adjustments to the historical values of property, plant and
equipment, other assets, liabilities and intangible assets, resulting in significant changes to depreciation
and amortization expenses and to debt fees being written off in our profit and loss account.

**Factors Affecting Future Results**

**_The Transactions_**

The Vue Acquisition and the Multikino Acquisition are each subject to the satisfaction of certain
conditions and may not be completed by the Issue Date. For details of the Vue Acquisition and the
Multikino Acquisition, see ‘‘The Transactions.’’

The Issuer is incurring a substantial amount of new debt to finance both the Vue Acquisition and the
Multikino Acquisition. On a pro forma basis, after giving effect to the Transactions, as at April 4, 2013, the
Issuer’s pro forma total third party borrowings would have been approximately £558.4 million (exclusive

88


-----

of capitalized debt issuance costs and OID). As a result of this increased third party borrowings, the
Issuer’s interest expense will significantly increase in future periods. On a pro forma basis, after giving
effect to the Transactions, the Issuer’s estimated cash interest expenses related to the Notes and the
Revolving Credit Facility would have been £38.4 million for the 53 week period ended April 4, 2013.
Accordingly, the Issuer’s financial results following completion of the Transactions may differ
significantly from our previously reported financial results. As at April 4, 2013, on a pro forma basis, after
giving effect to the Transactions, we estimate that the Issuer will record debt issuance costs of
£17.5 million (excluding OID) in connection with the Offering and the Revolving Credit Facility, which will
be amortized over the period of the respective borrowings. See ‘‘The Transactions—The Financing.’’

Pro forma for the Transactions, we expect that approximately 54% of the third party borrowings incurred
under the Issuer’s financing arrangements in connection with the Transactions will be denominated in
pounds sterling and we believe that 46% will be denominated in euros and other currencies. Therefore,
changes in foreign currency exchange rates may affect the value of the Issuer’s liabilities when reported
in pounds sterling and, therefore, the Issuer’s financial condition and results of operations.

The pro forma effects of the Transactions are presented elsewhere in the offering memorandum under
‘‘Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information.’’

**Description of key components of results of operations**

The key elements of our consolidated results of operations are set out below:

**_Turnover_**

Turnover is net of sales taxes, such as value added tax and comprises, in order of impact on overall
turnover:

- box office revenue, which is the revenue we receive from ticket sales;

- concession sales from the resale in our cinemas of soft drinks, popcorn, confectionery and other
retail products; and

- screen advertising and other income.

  - Screen advertising income is earned for sale of advertising time in all our markets.

  - Other income comprises booking fees charged for online and telephone bookings; corporate
sales income from off-screen advertising, corporate events and the bulk sale of tickets to
companies; and other sundry revenue, which includes the revenue we receive from
sponsorship from discount ticket days and advertising of Sony digital projectors.

**_Cost of Sales_**

Our principal cost of sales is the cost of renting the films that we show from film distributors, which
fluctuates with box office revenue due to the fact that rental costs are generally paid as a percentage of
box office revenue. Our film rental costs are therefore generally higher for successful films and can also
vary according to the length and value of a film’s run. Film rental rates vary by country and can vary on a
film-by-film and on a cinema-by-cinema basis.

The second largest component of cost of sales is the cost of purchasing concession products from our
various suppliers.

Other elements of cost of sales include marketing, royalties and authors’ rights costs, credit card
charges and 3D licensing fees.

**_Administrative Expenses_**

Our administrative expenses include both cash and non-cash items. Our cash administrative expenses
are significant, and include property-related costs including rent, staff costs, utility costs, equipment
rental payments, repairs and maintenance, IT and other expenses, such as head office costs. Non-cash
items primarily comprise depreciation of tangible fixed assets and amortization of goodwill.

89


-----

**_Interest Payable and Similar Charges_**

Interest payable and similar charges comprise interest payable, financing fees and similar financing
charges. Interest payable includes both cash interest, paid to third party lenders, and also non-cash
rolled up interest which is incurred on shareholder loans, and added to principal each year rather than
paid as cash interest.

**_Tax Charge_**

The charge for taxation is based on our profit or loss on ordinary activities, and takes account of taxation
deferred or accelerated because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation
and accounting purposes. The most significant such difference is the treatment of ‘‘capital expenditure,’’
for which depreciation allowable for taxation purposes (called capital allowances in the United Kingdom)
differs from depreciation for accounting purposes.

recurring operating performance that is unaffected by our capital structure and allows management to readily view operating
trends and identify strategies to improve operating performance. The EBITDA measures presented may not be comparable
to similarly titled measures used by other companies. We encourage you to review our financial information in its entirety and
not to rely on a single financial measure. See ‘‘Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Other Financial Measures’’
for an explanation of certain limitations to the use of these measures. For a reconciliation of each of the above measures to
our Consolidated Financial Statements, see ‘‘Summary Historical and Pro Forma Combined Financial Information and

Turnover increased by £93.3 million, or 100.0%, to £186.5 million in the 18 weeks ended April 4, 2013
from £93.2 million in the 18 weeks ended March 29, 2012. This increase was due primarily to the
acquisition of CinemaxX in August 2012, as well as the acquisition of Apollo in May 2012. CinemaxX has
a higher average ticket price, a higher total concession spend per person, and a higher total revenue per
person; consequently, the acquisition of CinemaxX resulted in an increase of these within the Group.

Excluding the contributions from CinemaxX and Apollo, turnover in our existing business increased by
£13.9 million, or 15.0%, to £107.2 million in the 18 weeks ended April 4 2013, principally due to an
increase in average ticket prices for the existing business as a result of increased 3D attendance and the
impact of our strategic pricing initiatives. Total admissions and average ticket prices also increased as a
result of strong performing films such as Skyfall, The Hobbit and Les Miserables. Of these, The Hobbit
was shown in 3D.

Concession revenues in our existing business also increased as a result of higher total admissions and
increased concession spend per person.

Advertising revenue in our existing business also increased, as a result of the continuing impact of Skyfall
and the release of _Twilight in December 2012, both of which prompted advertisers to increase their_
spend.

Other income increased primarily as a result of card handling fees from advanced bookings for
blockbuster films noted above, as well as income from large format posters, from May 2012, and from an
increase in revenue from corporate conferencing events.

United Kingdom turnover increased by £20.2 million, or 23.3%, to £107.1 million in the 18 weeks ended
April 4, 2013 from £86.9 million in the 18 weeks ended March 29, 2012. This increase reflected, in part,
the acquisition of Apollo in May 2012. Excluding turnover from Apollo, U.K. turnover in the existing
business increased by £13.9 million, or 16.0%, to £100.8 million in the 18 weeks ended April 4, 2013 from
£86.9 million in the 18 weeks ended March 29, 2012, principally due to increased box office revenue from
higher admissions generated from strong performing films including Les Miserables and The Hobbit,
and an increase in average ticket price, as noted above, as compared to the prior period.

Continental Europe turnover increased by £72.6 million to £76.7 million in the 18 weeks ended April 4,
2013 from £4.1 million in the 18 weeks ended March 29, 2012. This increase was due entirely to the
acquisition of CinemaxX in August 2012. Excluding turnover from CinemaxX, Continental Europe
turnover in the existing business decreased by £0.4 million, or 9.7%, to £3.7 million in the 18 weeks
ended April 4, 2013 from £4.1 million in the 18 weeks ended March 29, 2012, principally due to lower
admissions in Ireland as a result of a new competitor in Ireland. This was partially offset by an increase in
average ticket prices in Ireland and Portugal.

Turnover from other geographical markets increased by £0.4 million, or 19.8%, to £2.7 million in the
18 weeks ended April 4, 2013 from £2.2 million in the 18 weeks ended March 29, 2012, due to an
increase in both admissions and average ticket price in Taiwan.

_Cost of Sales_

The following table sets forth our cost of sales in the 18 weeks ended April 4, 2013 and March 29, 2012:

Cost of sales increased by £36.8 million, or 113.2%, to £69.3 million in the 18 weeks ended April 4, 2013
from £32.5 million in the 18 weeks ended March 29, 2012. This increase was primarily due to additional
cost of sales from the acquisitions of CinemaxX in August 2012 and Apollo in May 2012, which diluted
our gross profit margin. Excluding the cost of sales from CinemaxX and Apollo, cost of sales in our
existing business increased by £6.3 million, or 19.3%, to £38.8 million in the 18 weeks ended April 4,
2013, principally due to higher film rental costs, driven by higher total admissions and increased box
office revenue. The increase in other costs related to various elements of other income, primarily card
handling fees from an increased number of advanced bookings.

_Administrative expenses_

The following table sets forth our administrative expenses in the 18 weeks ended April 4, 2013 and
March 29, 2012:

**As at and for the 18 week**

**April 4,** **March 29,**

**Total administrative expenses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **(102,468)** **(61,111)**

Administrative expenses increased by £41.4 million, or 67.7%, to £102.5 million in the 18 weeks ended
April 4, 2013 from £61.1 million in the 18 weeks ended March 29, 2012. This increase was primarily due
to the acquisition of CinemaxX in August 2012 and Apollo in May 2012. Excluding the administrative
expenses from CinemaxX and Apollo, administrative expenses in our existing business increased by
£4.3 million, or 7.0%, to £65.4 million in the 18 weeks ended April 4, 2013, principally due to higher rent
resulting from certain rent payments being tied to box office revenue, which generally improved in the
18 weeks ended April 4, 2013, and non-recurring costs in the form of refinancing fees for the refinancing
of our bank loans in December 2012, and an increase in our onerous lease provision as a result of the
impact of the refinancing on the weighted cost of capital used to calculate that provision.

_Interest Payable and Similar Charges_

Interest payable and similar charges increased by £6.1 million, or 33.6%, to £24.4 million in the 18 weeks
ended April 4, 2013 from £18.2 million in the 18 weeks ended March 29, 2012. This increase in interest
payable and similar charges was due primarily to the additional debt incurred relating to the acquisitions
of CinemaxX and Apollo plus interest payable on the existing shareholder loans.

_Tax charge_

Tax charge on ordinary activities increased by £4.7 million to £3.3 million in the 18 weeks ended April 4,
2013 from a tax credit of £1.4 million in the 18 weeks ended March 29, 2012. This increase in tax charge
on ordinary activities was primarily the result of stronger trading results in the 18 weeks ended April 4,
2013, in addition to the impact on the Group’s results of the higher effective tax rate on profits from
German operations.

Turnover increased by £99.6 million, or 35.4%, to £380.7 million in the 53 weeks ended November 29,
2012 from £281.1 million in the 49 trading weeks ended November 24, 2011. This increase was due
primarily to additional turnover from the acquisitions of CinemaxX in August 2012 and Apollo in May
2012. The acquisition of CinemaxX resulted in increases to our average ticket price, total concession
spend per person, and total revenue per person, as CinemaxX benefits from higher average prices than
our existing business.

Excluding the contributions from CinemaxX and Apollo, turnover in our existing business increased by
£28.6 million, or 10.2%, to £309.7 million in the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012, principally due to
an increase in box office revenue. This increase in box office revenue in our existing business primarily
reflects attendance from a full 53 weeks of trading in the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012, compared
to only 49 weeks of trading in the 56 weeks ended November 24, 2011 and the impact of opening
Stratford in September 2011, which increased our screens by 17 and contributed an entire year of
turnover in the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012. Box office revenue in our existing business also
grew due to strong average ticket price growth resulting from our strategic pricing initiatives and
customary price increases, and favorable movement from a reduced proportion of discount tickets. The
increase in box revenue was partially offset by weaker summer admissions in 2012 as a result of an
underperforming summer film slate (films such as John Carter and Battleship performed poorly) and
lower demand during the London 2012 Olympics and Paralympics and the 2012 European football
championship.

-----

Concession revenues in our existing business also increased in the 53 weeks ended November 29,
2012, from a slight increase in total concession spend per person and the increase from 49 to 53 weeks
of trading.

Advertising revenue in our existing business also increased in the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012,
due to the combined impact of Digital Cinema Media’s (‘‘DCM’’) conversion to digital operations and the
impact of Skyfall, which attracted significant advertising revenues, as well as the increase from 49 to
53 weeks of trading.

United Kingdom turnover increased by £43.3 million, or 16.7%, to £303.2 million in the 53 weeks ended
November 29, 2012 from £259.9 million in the 49 trading weeks ended November 24, 2011. This
increase was due partially to the additional turnover generated as a result of the acquisition of Apollo in
May 2012. Excluding turnover from Apollo from May 10, 2012, U.K. turnover in the existing business
increased by £31.7 million, or 12.2%, to £291.7 million in the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012 from
£259.9 million in the 49 trading weeks ended November 24, 2011, principally due to the reasons
provided above.

Continental Europe turnover increased by £56.5 million to £70.7 million in the 53 weeks ended
November 29, 2012 from £14.3 million in the 49 trading weeks ended November 24, 2011. This increase
was due primarily to the acquisition of CinemaxX in August 2012. Excluding turnover from CinemaxX
from August 7, 2012, Continental Europe turnover in the existing business, decreased by £2.9 million, or
20.6%, to £11.3 million in the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012 from £14.3 million in the 49 trading
weeks ended November 24, 2011.

Turnover from other geographical markets decreased by £0.2 million, or 2.7%, to £6.7 million in the
53 weeks ended November 29, 2012 from £6.9 million in the 49 trading weeks ended November 24,
2011.

(1) Covers the 56 weeks from the date of incorporation of Vue Entertainment International Limited to November 24, 2011, but of
which only 49 weeks included trading results.

Cost of sales increased by £41.3 million, or 41.3%, to £141.2 million in the 53 weeks ended
November 29, 2012 from £99.9 million in the 49 trading weeks ended November 24, 2011. This increase
was due primarily to the increase in turnover from the Acquired Businesses, and these Acquired
Businesses also incur a higher cost of sales as a percentage of turnover than the existing business.
Excluding the impact of the Acquired Businesses, cost of sales in our existing business increased as a
result of organic growth in box office revenue due to the performance of certain films, such as Skyfall,
which commanded a relatively high film rental cost, and higher 3D licensing fees resulting from
increasing the number of 3D screens.

Concession cost of goods sold also increased, as a result of higher concession sales. Another
contributing factor to the increased cost of sales was the increase in the period from 49 to 53 trading
weeks.

_Administrative Expenses_

The following table sets forth our administrative expenses in the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012
and the 49 trading weeks ended November 24, 2011:

(1) Covers the 56 weeks from the date of incorporation of Vue Entertainment International Limited to November 24, 2011, but of
which only 49 weeks included trading results.

Administrative expenses increased by £55.2 million, or 33.2%, to £221.6 million in the 53 weeks ended
November 29, 2012 from £166.4 million in the 49 trading weeks ended November 24, 2011. This
increase was due primarily to higher rentals under operating leases on cinema sites of £67.8 million, as
compared to £49.2 million in the 49 trading weeks ended November 24, 2011, principally due to rental
costs of the Acquired Businesses.

Excluding the impact of the Acquired Businesses, administrative expenses in our existing business
increased principally due to the increase in this period from 49 to 53 trading weeks. Also contributing to
the increase in administrative expenses in our existing business was a higher level of depreciation on
tangible fixed assets, principally relating to the larger network of cinemas and to upgrades at Vue’s U.K.
cinemas. Depreciation increased to £30.2 million as compared to £24.9 million in the 49 trading weeks
ended November 24, 2011. In addition, the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012 included a full year of
property rental expense and operating costs for Westfield Stratford, which opened in September 2011.

-----

Staff costs increased by £11.9 million, or 33.1%, to £48.1 million in the 53 weeks ended November 29,
2012 from £36.2 million in the 49 trading weeks ended November 24, 2011. The average number of
employees rose to 3,940 during the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012 as compared to 3,267 during
the 49 trading weeks ended November 24, 2011 as a result of the Apollo and CinemaxX acquisitions and
opening Westfield Stratford. The increase in this period from 49 to 53 trading weeks also contributed to
the increase in staff costs. These increases were partly mitigated by staffing efficiencies enabled by the
digital screen roll-out in our existing business, which resulted in a decline in staff costs per admission as
digital screens do not require projectionists.

_Interest Payable and Similar Charges_

Interest payable and similar charges increased by £10.7 million, or 23.2%, to £56.8 million in the
53 weeks ended November 29, 2012 from £46.1 million in the 49 trading weeks ended November 24,
2011. This increase was due primarily to the additional debt relating to the acquisitions of CinemaxX and
Apollo plus interest payable on the existing shareholder loans, as well as the increase in the period from
49 to 53 trading weeks.

_Tax charge_

Tax charge on loss on ordinary activities remained stable at £2.6 million in the 53 weeks ended
November 29, 2012 from £2.6 million in the 49 trading weeks ended November 24, 2011. An explanation
of these changes may be found in note 9 of our audited consolidated financial statements for the
53 week period ended November 29, 2012.

Turnover decreased by £27.3 million, or 8.9%, to £281.1 million in the 49 trading weeks ended
November 24, 2011 from £308.4 million in the 52 weeks ended November 25, 2010. This decrease was
due primarily to a reduction in concession and screen advertising revenue in the U.K., in the context of
relatively stable box office revenue.

97


-----

Box office revenue remained relatively stable between periods. The 49 trading weeks ended
November 24, 2011 was characterized by a favorable slate of successful films releases, including 3D
releases such as Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows—Part 2 and Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger
_Tides, and popular British films such as The Inbetweeners and The King’s Speech. Additionally, average_
ticket prices increased slightly during the period, reflecting customary ticket price increases. Ticket price
increases and the benefits from the favorable film slate were largely offset by unusual weather patterns in
the United Kingdom. Admissions in the trading months of December and April were impacted by severe
snowfalls and unseasonably warm weather, respectively. Rioting in the United Kingdom in 2011 also had
a negative impact on admissions, particularly in London, where we have a significant presence.
Year-on-year performance was also impacted by having only 49 trading weeks in this period, as
opposed to 52 trading weeks ended November 25, 2010, and by 2010 being a strong comparable
period due to a high proportion of 3D films including Avatar, Alice in Wonderland and Toy Story 3.

Concession revenues decreased in the 49 trading weeks ended November 24, 2011, driven by the
presence of only 49 trading weeks, a reduction in overall admissions and a reduction in concession
spend per person. The reduction in concession spend per person was due, in part, to an increased
proportion of discount customers who, we believe, typically spend less on concessions (such as
‘‘Kids AM’’ and ‘‘Orange Wednesday’’ customers).

Screen advertising revenue was subject to a significant decrease in the 49 trading weeks ended
November 24, 2011, due to the presence of only 49 trading weeks and the expiration of the favorable
contract with our previous U.K. advertising supplier, Pearl & Dean, which included a minimum guarantee
payments that provided protection against a declining on-screen advertising market. On January 1,
2011, we changed our U.K. contract supplier to DCM, operating under a revenue share arrangement
with no minimum guarantee.

(1) Covers the 56 weeks from the date of incorporation of Vue Entertainment International Limited to November 24, 2011, but of
which only 49 weeks included trading results.

United Kingdom turnover decreased by £29.1 million, or 10.1%, to £259.9 million in the 49 trading weeks
ended November 24, 2011 from £289.1 million in the 52 weeks ended November 25, 2010, principally
due to the reasons provided above.

Continental Europe turnover decreased by £0.3 million, or 2.4%, to £14.3 million in the 49 trading weeks
ended November 24, 2011 from £14.6 million in the 52 weeks ended November 25, 2010. In Continental
Europe, admissions decreased, primarily due to increased competition in 3D as competitors rolled out
digital technology, reducing the advantage we had accrued by introducing such offerings in 2010.
Average ticket prices increased, as we raised 2D pricing to close the gap in the premium paid for 3D
tickets.

Turnover from other geographical markets increased by £2.1 million, or 45.0%, to £6.9 million in the 49
trading weeks ended November 24, 2011 from £4.8 million in the 52 weeks ended November 25, 2010,
primarily due to significant growth in admissions in Taiwan.

_Cost of Sales_

Cost of sales decreased by £7.5 million, or 7.0%, to £99.9 million in the 49 trading weeks ended
November 24, 2011 from £107.4 million in the 52 weeks ended November 25, 2010. This decrease was

98


-----

due primarily to lower film rental and concession costs, which were themselves the result of lower U.K.
admissions and concession sales. The presence of only 49 trading weeks in the period, as compared to
52 weeks in the prior period, also contributed to the decrease in cost of sales.

_Administrative Expenses_

Administrative expenses decreased by £2.7 million, or 1.6%, to £166.4 million in the 49 trading weeks
ended November 24, 2011 from £169.1 million in the 52 weeks ended November 25, 2010, primarily due
to lower levels of depreciation on owned assets and leasehold properties and lower rentals under
operating leases on land and buildings. This decrease was partly offset by amortization of goodwill
relating to the acquisition of Vue Entertainment Investment Limited (£13.4 million charged for the period,
of £289.4 million over an estimated economic life of 20 years).

Staff costs decreased by £3.7 million, or 9.2%, to £36.2 million in the 49 trading weeks ended
November 24, 2011 from £39.9 million in the 52 weeks ended November 25, 2010 despite a slight
increase in the average number of employees to 3,267 during the 49 trading weeks ended November 24,
2011 as compared to 3,234 for the 52 weeks ended November 25, 2010. This decrease on staff costs
was due in part to headcount reductions resulting from our digitalization program, as the digital screen
roll-out commenced during the 49 trading weeks ended November 24, 2011. The presence of only 49
trading weeks in the period, as compared to 52 weeks in the prior period, also contributed to the
decrease in administrative expenses.

_Interest Payable and Similar Charges_

Interest payable and similar charges increased by £1.5 million, or 3.3%, to an expense of £46.1 million in
the 49 trading weeks ended November 24, 2011 from an expense of £44.6 million in the 52 weeks ended
November 25, 2010. This increase in interest payable and similar charges was due to debt arising from
the Doughty Hanson acquisition in December 2010, including the write-off of the residual amount of
unamortized, capitalized issue costs relating to our previous financing structure.

_Tax Charge_

Tax charge on loss on ordinary activities decreased by £0.8 million, or 24.1%, to £2.6 million in the 49
trading weeks ended November 24, 2011 from £3.5 million in the 52 weeks ended November 25, 2010
due to the reduction in operating profit, the shorter trading period, and a reduction in the corporation tax
rates.

Our effective income tax rate for the 49 trading weeks ended November 24, 2011 was 26.67%, compared
to 28.0% in the 52 weeks ended November 25, 2010.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

**_Overview_**

Historically, our principal sources of liquidity have been cash flows from operating activities, which
include revenues generated through box office admissions, concessions sales and screen advertising,
sometimes supplemented by use of borrowings under the Existing Bank Facility and our existing
working capital facility. Our principal uses of cash are acquisitions, working capital, operating expenses
such as property rent and staff costs, cinema improvements and other capital expenditures and debt
servicing costs.

Following the Transactions and the application of the proceeds therefrom, the Issuer’s debt service
obligations will consist primarily of interest payments on the Notes and principal and interest payments
on the amounts drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility. We believe that the Issuer’s available cash
balances, combined with the Issuer’s cash flows from operating activities and borrowing capacity under
the Revolving Credit Facility, will be sufficient to meet its expected general liquidity needs and debt
service obligations for the next 12 months. However, the Issuer will be highly leveraged and have
significant debt service obligations, and we cannot provide assurance that the Issuer’s business will
generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its liquidity needs, including making payments in
the Notes or on other debt when due.

The Issuer’s ability to generate cash from operations will depend on its future operating performance,
which is in turn dependent on various factors, including but not limited to those described under

99


-----

‘‘—Principal factors affecting results of operations and financial performance,’’ many of which are
beyond the Issuer’s control. Furthermore, the Issuer’s liquidity will also be affected by the quantity,
quality and timing of film releases. For example, film distributors generally release the films which they
anticipate will be the most successful during the summer and Christmas holiday seasons. Consequently,
we have typically generated higher revenues during such periods. Furthermore, if the Issuer’s cash flow
from operating activities is lower than expected, or the Issuer’s capital expenditure requirements exceed
our projections, the Issuer may be required to seek additional financing, which may not be available on
commercially reasonable terms, if at all. The Issuer’s ability to arrange financing generally and its cost of
capital will depend on numerous factors, including general economic conditions, the availability of credit
from banks, other financial institutions and capital markets, restrictions in the instruments governing the
Issuer’s debt and its general financial performance. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Financial
_Profile—Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business and_
_prevent us from fulfilling our obligations with respect to the Notes’’ and ‘‘—Risks Relating to Our Financial_
_Profile—We require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our operations. Our_
_ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors beyond our control, and we may be forced to_
_take other actions to satisfy our debt obligations, which may not always be successful.’’_

We maintain cash and cash equivalents to fund the day-to-day requirements of our business. We hold
cash primarily in pounds sterling and euro. As at April 4, 2013, we had £54.2 million in net cash in hand
and at bank. This total includes the Restricted Cash in CinemaxX, which due to the timing of certain legal
procedures relating to the Squeeze Out and the German Company Conversion is currently restricted.
Accordingly, at the Vue Acquisition Completion Date, Midco will lend to the Issuer pursuant to the Bridge
Loan Agreement an amount £34.1 million equal to the Restricted Cash. See ‘‘Certain Relationships and
_Related Party Transactions—Bridge Loan Notes’’ and ‘‘The Transactions—The Financing.’’ As at April 4,_
2013 we also had £4.0 million of cash in CinemaxX, held as security for various property lease
obligations.

**_Outstanding Indebtedness_**

As at April 4, 2013, total amounts outstanding under our Existing Bank Facility and our existing working
capital facility and other third party loans was £385.8 million (net of capitalized issue costs), plus accrued
interest of £2.1 million. In addition we had amounts due to our shareholders in respect of preference
shares, loan notes and bridge loans amounting to £312.5 million in aggregate, including accrued
interest of £66.5 million. As a result of the Transactions, substantially all of our indebtedness will be
repaid. See ‘‘Capitalization,’’ ‘‘The Transactions’’ and ‘‘Use of Proceeds.’’

Following the completion of the Transactions, the Issuer will be highly leveraged and have significant
debt service obligations. As at April 4, 2013 on a pro forma basis for the Transactions, the Issuer would
have had approximately £558.4 million of third party borrowings (exclusive of capitalized debt issuance
costs and OID), of which approximately £550.7 million would have been represented by the Notes. In
addition on a pro forma basis, the Issuer would have £467.1 million of loans, specifically the Issuer Loan
and Bridge Loan. See ‘‘Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Issuer Loan’’ and ‘‘Certain
_Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Bridge Loan.’’ As at April 4, 2013 on a pro forma basis for_
the Transactions, the Issuer would have had £39.8 million in cash and cash equivalents on hand
including the Restricted Cash as described above.

We anticipate that the Issuer’s high leverage will continue for the foreseeable future. Following the
transactions, we expect that the Issuer’s principal sources of liquidity will be cash flow from operations,
cash at bank and the Revolving Credit Facility. For further information regarding liquidity arrangements,
please refer to the section entitled ‘‘Description of certain financing arrangements.’’

(1) The data for the 18 weeks ended March 29, 2012, 49 trading weeks ended November 24, 2011 and the 52 weeks ended
November 25, 2010 do not include any amounts related to Apollo or CinemaxX.

(2) Covers the 56 weeks from the date of incorporation of Vue Entertainment International Limited to November 24, 2011, but of
which only 49 weeks included trading results.

_Net cash inflow from operating activities_

Net cash inflow from operating activities consists of profit before interest and tax, as adjusted for
changes in working capital and non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization.

Net cash inflow from operating activities increased by £7.0 million to £9.2 million in the 18 weeks ended
April 4, 2013 from £2.1 million in the 18 weeks ended March 29, 2012, mainly due to improved trading
performance from the existing business in the United Kingdom, as well as the impact of the Acquired
Businesses. Performance was partially offset by adverse working capital movement from payments
made to trade creditors and related trade accrual movements, particularly in relation to film rental
liabilities relating to _Skyfall, which were accrued as at 29 November 2012 and paid in the following_
period.

Net cash inflow from operating activities increased by £31.3 million, or 101.9%, to £62.0 million in the
53 weeks ended November 29, 2012 from £30.7 million in the 49 trading weeks ended November 24,
2011. Film rental suppliers are paid after the film is shown which means that working capital will fluctuate
with the quality of the film slate. The strong performance of Skyfall referred to above resulted in higher
levels of accrued film rental liabilities at 29 November 2012 compared with the liabilities relating to films
shown in November 2011. As a consequence net cash flows from operating activities increased primarily
as the result of the acquisition of the Acquired Businesses, as well as the improved working capital
movement on trade creditors within our existing business, and due to the presence of a full 53 weeks of
trading in the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012, compared to only 49 weeks of trading in the 49
trading weeks ended November 24, 2011.

Net cash inflow from operating activities decreased by £37.7 million, or 55.1%, to £30.7 million in the 49
trading weeks ended November 24, 2011 from £68.4 million in the 52 weeks ended November 25, 2010.
This decrease was primarily the result of the payment of creditors relating to both the payment of fees
following the acquisition of the group by Doughty Hanson in December 2010 and the payment of film
rental liabilities in 2011 following the strong film slate in November 2010, which included Harry Potter and
_the Deathly Hallows: Part 1. Also contributing to the decrease was the presence of only 49 weeks of_
trading in the 49 trading weeks ended November 24, 2011, as compared to a full 52 weeks of trading in
the 52 weeks ended November 25, 2010.

_Net cash outflow from returns on investments and servicing of finance_

Net cash outflow from returns on investments and servicing of finance consists of cash interest paid on
our indebtedness, net of cash interest received on our cash and cash equivalents. Under our existing

101


-----

financing facilities we can pay interest either monthly, quarterly or half-yearly. Therefore, the amount of
interest paid in any period depends on our choice of interest roll-up period.

Net cash outflow from returns on investments and servicing of finance decreased by £1.9 million to an
outflow of £8.0 million in the 18 weeks ended April 4, 2013 from an outflow of £9.9 million in the 18 weeks
ended March 29, 2012, primarily due to a seven-month interest payment falling due in the 18 weeks
ended March 29, 2012 compared to a three-month interest payment in the 18 weeks ended April 4, 2013.
The decrease was partly offset by the higher interest and a syndicate waiver fee resulting from new
financing facilities relating to the acquisition of Apollo and CinemaxX in the 18 weeks ended April 4,
2013.

Net cash outflow from returns on investments and servicing of finance increased by £12.9 million, or
116.2%, to an outflow of £24.0 million in the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012 compared to an outflow
of £11.1 million in the 49 trading weeks ended November 24, 2011. This increase was due to timing of
interest payments, as described above.

Net cash outflow from returns on investments and servicing of finance decreased by £11.3 million, or
50.5%, to an outflow of £11.1 million in the 49 trading weeks ended November 24, 2011 compared to an
outflow of £22.5 million in the 52 weeks ended November 25, 2010. This decrease was primarily due to
the timing of interest payments in the first year after the Doughty Hanson acquisition, offset by the
termination of previous swap arrangements in November 2010.

_Net cash outflow for capital expenditure and other financial investments_

Net cash outflow for capital expenditure and other financial investments consists of investments in
subsidiaries, investments and disposals in property, plant and equipment and fixtures, disposals of real
estate and other changes and disposals. See ‘‘—Capital Expenditures’’ below.

Net cash outflow for capital expenditure and other financial investments increased by £8.0 million to an
outflow of £11.5 million in the 18 weeks ended April 4, 2013 from an outflow of £3.6 million in the
18 weeks ended March 29, 2012 due primarily to the acquisition of a further 2.3% interest in the share
capital of CinemaxX.

Net cash outflow for capital expenditure and other financial investments decreased by £326.5 million, or
70.1%, to an outflow of £139.3 million in the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012 compared to an outflow
of £465.8 million in the 49 trading weeks ended November 24, 2011. This decrease was primarily the
result of lower levels of investment in subsidiaries, following the December 2010 acquisition of Vue
Entertainment Investment Limited.

Net cash outflow for capital expenditure and other financial investments increased by £449.9 million to
an outflow of £465.8 million in the 49 trading weeks ended November 24, 2011 compared to an outflow
of £16.0 million in the 52 weeks ended November 25, 2010. This increase was primarily the result of the
December 2010 acquisition of Vue Entertainment Investment Limited.

_Net cash inflow to/(outflow from) financing activities_

Net cash inflow/(outflow) from financing activities mainly consists of proceeds from borrowings,
repayments from borrowings and settlement of derivatives, share repurchases and the issue of shares.

Net cash outflow from financing activities decreased by £4.1 million to £0.3 million in the 18 weeks ended
April 4, 2013 from £4.3 million in the 18 weeks ended March 29, 2012 primarily due to the repayment of
£4.7 million of loan notes in the 18 weeks ended March 29, 2012.

Net cash inflow from financing activities decreased by £317.1 million, or 68.4%, to an inflow of
£146.7 million in the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012 compared to an inflow of £463.8 million in the
49 trading weeks ended November 24, 2011. This decrease in inflow was primarily the result of new bank
loan facilities and loan notes taken out in the 49 trading weeks ended November 24, 2011, partly offset
by shareholder loans taken out to fund the purchase of the Acquired Businesses in the 53 weeks ended
November 29, 2012.

Net cash inflow from financing activities was £463.8 million in the 49 trading weeks ended November 24,
2011 compared to an outflow of £28.0 million in the 52 weeks ended November 25, 2010. This change
was primarily due to bank loan borrowings and the issue of loan notes in connection with the acquisition
of Vue Entertainment Investment Limited during the 56 weeks ended November 24, 2011.

**_Working Capital_**

Our working capital requirements largely arise from the seasonality of our business. The majority of our
customers are members of the public visiting cinema sites, from whom cash is generally collected either
on the day of their visit, or shortly thereafter through credit card settlements. Our short-term payables
primarily relate to payments to film distributors, landlords for property rents, suppliers of concessions
products, fixed asset suppliers and VAT. Our property rents in the United Kingdom are typically paid
quarterly. Our short-term receivables include advertising income and are generally lower than our shortterm payables. Our working capital is therefore generally a net creditor position.

We have historically funded our peak working capital requirements through available cash balances,
funds generated from our operations, sometimes supplemented by use of borrowings under the Existing
Bank Facility, and our working capital facility for short-term payables and quarterly rental payments.
During our high-volume periods, our business is highly cash-generative as our group revenue is
primarily driven by admissions. Depending on the timing of the Vue Acquisition Completion Date, the
Issuer may draw on the Revolving Credit Facility up to approximately £15.0 million for working capital
purposes and may continue to utilize the Revolving Credit Facility going forward.

**_Capital Expenditures_**

We invest our capital in order to maintain and strengthen our competitive position. Capital expenditures
include:

- maintenance capital expenditures—capital expenditures for refurbishment work, including
refreshing sites, installing new toilets, re-laying carpets and painting;

- revenue enhancing capital expenditures—capital expenditures undertaken to increase admissions,
generate incremental revenues, and achieve cost savings; and

- development capital expenditures—capital expenditures on internal site development net of
landlord contributions.

The following table shows our historical capital expenditures for the periods presented.

(1) The data for the 49 trading weeks ended November 24, 2011 and the 52 weeks ended November 25, 2010 do not include any
amounts related to Apollo or CinemaxX.

(2) Covers the 56 weeks from the date of incorporation of Vue Entertainment International Limited to November 24, 2011, but of
which only 49 weeks included trading results.

(3) Includes capital expenditures for Ireland, Portugal and Taiwan, as well as Apollo from the date of acquisition.

(4) The capital expenditure figures presented do not include contributions from landlords of £1.3 million in the 53 weeks ended
November 29, 2012, £8.2 million in the 49 trading weeks ended November 24, 2011 and £5.8 million in the 52 weeks ended
November 25, 2010 relating to the maintenance and development of our sites, pursuant to contractual arrangements.

Our historical capital expenditure has related primarily to purchases of fixed assets, acquisition of assets
used in cinemas, cinema refurbishment and other related costs.

In the periods under review, our historical capital expenditure (excluding maintenance capex) has
related primarily to:

- the development of the four new Vue cinemas which were opened at Westfield London, Bury the
Rock, Westfield Stratford and Halifax;

- the full digital conversion of our United Kingdom and Irish cinemas, which began in June 2011 and
was completed in summer 2012;

- in Germany, initiatives to enhance certain cinemas; and

103


-----

- initiatives to increase admissions, such as additional screens at the existing cinemas, and cost
rationalization plans, such as energy-saving initiatives.

We expect total capital expenditures in 2013 and 2014 to be higher than in 2012 as a result of the full year
effect of the acquisitions of Apollo, CinemaxX and Multikino, and increased new site development in
these two years, although we expect the total will be less than £40 million per annum (net of landlord
contributions, including the full-year effect of CinemaxX and Apollo and including Multikino). In 2012,
total capital expenditures net of landlord contributions amounted to £21.7 million (excluding Multikino).
In Germany, planned capital expenditures include those related to upgrading all CinemaxX cinemas to
be fully digital by the end of July 2013. Across the Group, planned revenue-enhancing capital
expenditures include additional VIP seating and additional screens. We believe that a significant portion
of our capital expenditure investments are discretionary.

For further information, see ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and the Industry—Acquiring
_or expanding existing cinemas may require additional financing, and we cannot be certain that we will be_
_able to obtain new financing on favorable terms, or at all.’’_

**_Contractual obligations and commercial commitments_**

The table below sets forth the Issuer’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments as at
April 4, 2013, pro forma for the Financing, that are expected to have an impact on the Issuer’s liquidity
and cash flow in future periods. The information presented in this table reflects management’s estimates
of the contractual payment streams of its current obligations as at April 4, 2013, pro forma for the
Financing, which may differ significantly from the actual payments made under these obligations.

(1) Including principal payments in respect of the Notes offered hereby. See ‘‘Description of the Notes.’’ The aggregate principal
amount of the Floating Rate Notes has been converted into pounds sterling at a rate of e1.15693 to £1.00 as at July 10, 2013.

(2) Represents the £50.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. Depending on the timing of the Vue Acquisition Completion Date, the
Issuer may draw on the Revolving Credit Facility up to approximately £15.0 million for working capital purposes and may
continue to utilize the Revolving Credit Facility going forward. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Revolving Credit Facility.’’_

(3) Represents the loan of up to £433 million extended to the Issuer by Midco, pursuant to shareholder loan agreements
between the Issuer and Midco, on or prior to the Vue Acquisition Completion Date. See ‘‘Certain Relationships and Related
_Party Transactions—Issuer Loan.’’_

(4) Represents the loan of £34.1 million extended to the Issuer by Midco, pursuant to the Bridge Loan, the proceeds of which will
have been advanced to Midco from Finco through an intercompany loan and/or share subscription. The proceeds that Finco
will provide to Midco will have been advanced to Finco pursuant to the issuance of the Bridge Loan Notes. See ‘‘Certain
_Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Bridge Loan.’’_

(5) Represents an interest free loan provided by the German Federal Film Board.

(6) Consists of payments under our finance leases; does not include payments under finance leases within Multikino.

(7) Consists of payments under our operating leases for various property and equipment and primarily represent minimum
payments under cinema and office lease agreements; does not include payments under operating leases within Multikino.

The table does not include outstanding purchase contracts with product suppliers, payments due under
arrangements relating to provisions of services, maintenance (including Information Technology),
cleaning and utilities, contingent liabilities or local working capital facilities entered into in the ordinary
course of business.

104


-----

In the normal course of business, we make various commitments to purchase goods and services from
specific suppliers, including commitments to contractors, service providers and suppliers related to our
capital expenditure. As at April 4, 2013, we had contractually committed approximately £25.9 million to
our capital expenditure programs.

**Off Balance Sheet Obligations**

As at April 4, 2013, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases of
approximately £88.4 million, as disclosed in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements and
summarized in ‘‘—Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments.’’

**Group Cash Management**

Cash management in the UK and Ireland is managed closely with monthly and weekly cash forecasts,
predicting revenues and expenditures. Any surplus cash not required to service our working capital,
debt or our capital expenditure program is invested in short-term UK money market or bank deposit
accounts. Portugal and Taiwan manage their own cash balances, and the Group oversees their cash by
sweeping cash back to the UK once they exceed limits set by the Group. CinemaxX also prepares cash
forecasts to manage its requirements, but as at the date of this offering memorandum, the Group is not
sweeping this cash back to the UK due to the presence of the Minority Interest.

_Intercompany Funding_

Whenever finance requirements become necessary within the Group, we attempt to address the
necessary financing from internal sources before seeking outside financing. This intercompany funding
is effected either through intercompany loans or equity injections, with the form of investment depending
on the subsidiary’s circumstances and country-specific company law. We have established
intercompany loans between most of our U.K. and international operating businesses.

**Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosure about Market and Operating Risk**

We are exposed to various market and operating risks, including interest rate, credit, liquidity and foreign
exchange rate risks associated with our underlying assets, liabilities, forecast transactions and firm
commitments. Our overall financial risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of
financial markets and seeks to minimize potential adverse effects on our financial position and
performance. Management is responsible for managing exposure to market risk that arises in
connection with operations and financial activities, including interest rate, credit, liquidity and foreign
exchange rate risks.

Furthermore, we are exposed to liquidity risks relating to credit risks and market risks or a weakening of
business or financial market disturbances.

The following sections discuss our most significant exposures to market risk. The following discussions
do not address other risks that we face in the normal course of business.

**_Interest Rate Risk_**

We manage our net exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate financial debt and
variable rate financial debt in our total financial debt portfolio. To manage this mix, we may enter into
interest rate swap agreements, in which we exchange periodic payments based on a notional amount
and agreed upon fixed and variable interest rates and into forward contracts, in which we exchange fixed
amounts of foreign currency and fixed amounts of euro.

Our financial liabilities issued at floating rates, including the Floating Rate Notes, will expose us to cash
flow interest rate risk, while financial liabilities issued at fixed rates expose us to fair value interest rate
risk. To manage the exposure to changes in interest rates and to lower the overall costs of financing, we
will consider using interest rate swaps to exchange the interest rate exposure on a portion of the
indebtedness from a floating interest rate to a fixed interest rate or from a fixed interest rate to a floating
interest rate, as applicable. Such instruments may not cover our full exposure to interest rate risks. We
will also consider hedging our obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, as appropriate.

On March 10, 2011 we entered into two swaps with a notional value at November 29, 2012 of
£181.0 million and e20.0 million. These swaps terminate on February 28, 2014. Under these swaps, we

105


-----

receive or pay interest depending on whether the variable rate (based in LIBOR and EURIBOR,
respectively) is greater or less than the fixed rates of 2.31% and 2.56%, respectively. In total, at
29 November 29, 2012 these swaps covered 62% of our senior debt facilities.

On March 13, 2013 the Group entered into two swaps with a notional value of £35 million and e70 million.
Under these swaps, the Group receives or pays interest depending on whether the variable rate (based
in LIBOR and EURIBOR) is greater or less than the fixed of 0.535% and 0.385%, respectively. Both the
swaps have a termination date of February 28, 2015. There has been no change in the terms or interest
on the swaps previously in place, and disclosure can be found in the consolidated financial statements
of the Company as at and for the 53-week period ended November 29, 2012.

**_Credit risk_**

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising from the counterparty’s inability to repay or service debt in
accordance with the contractual terms. Credit risk includes both the direct risk of default and the risk of a
deterioration of creditworthiness, as well as concentration risks. Although we are generally in a net credit
position and have limited operation credit risk (see ‘‘—Working Capital’’ above), we believe we have
appropriate credit policies, procedures and authorization guidelines in place to manage and monitor
credit risk.

Credit risk relating to cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and financial deposits
and money market funds arises from the risk that the counterparty becomes insolvent and, accordingly,
is unable to return the deposited funds or execute the obligations under the derivative transactions as a
result of the insolvency. To mitigate this risk, wherever possible we conduct transactions and deposits
funds with investment-grade rated financial institutions and monitor and limit the concentration of
transactions with any single party.

**_Foreign exchange risk_**

Our reported results of operations and financial condition are affected by exchange rate fluctuations due
to both transaction and translation risks. Given our increasing focus on non-U.K. markets and the recent
volatility of other currencies against pounds sterling, the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our
reported results of operations could increase over time. Our exposure to currency exchange rate
fluctuations is of several types, as summarized below:

- Transaction risk arises when our subsidiaries execute transactions in a currency other than their
functional currency. On a consolidated basis, we consider the Group’s transaction foreign
exchange risk to be low, primarily as a result of the natural hedge of our foreign currency income
and expenses.

- Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in pounds sterling. We are therefore exposed
to translation risk on the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements when we translate
the financial statements of our subsidiaries which have a functional currency other than pounds
sterling. A portion of our assets, liabilities, revenue and costs are denominated in various currencies
other than pounds sterling, principally euro (from CinemaxX Germany operations, Portugal and
Ireland), and going forward, in złoty, lats and litas after the Multikino Acquisition. As a result, our
consolidated results of operations, which are reported in pounds sterling, are affected by currency
exchange rate fluctuations. During the 18 weeks ended April 4, 2013, we generated 57.5% of our
revenue in pounds sterling, 41.1% in euro and 1.4% in other currencies. Strength in pounds sterling
will reduce the reported results of operations of our non-U.K. businesses and conversely weakness
in pounds sterling will increase the reported results of operations of our non-U.K. businesses. These
transactions could affect the comparability of our results between financial periods or result in
changes to the carrying value of our assets, liabilities and shareholders’ equity. A 5% fluctuation in
pounds sterling to euro exchange rate, with all other variables held in constant, would have resulted
in a £1.5 million to £1.6 million impact on our operating profit for the 53 weeks ended April 4, 2013.

We do not currently hedge our foreign currency exposure.

**_Liquidity Risk_**

Liquidity risk, also called funding risk, is that we may have difficulty in obtaining funds in order to be able
to meet both our day-to-day operating requirements and our debt servicing obligations (interest and
debt repayment).

106


-----

We monitor our liquidity requirements and mitigate liquidity risk by ensuring we maintain sufficient cash,
the availability of funding from an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close
out market positions.

Cash flow forecasting is performed by management of our operating entities which is consolidated by
our finance team. These rolling forecasts are monitored to ensure our cash and liquidity requirements
are sufficient to meet operational needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on our undrawn
committed borrowing facilities. This enables our management to monitor compliance with borrowing
limits and debt covenants on our borrowing facilities.

**Critical accounting policies**

Our preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make assumptions,
undertake estimates and exercise judgment that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the
balance sheet date and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the fiscal period. All
assumptions, expectations and forecasts used as a basis for certain estimates within the Consolidated
Financial Statements represent good-faith assessments of our future performance for which
management believes there is a reasonable basis. Estimates and judgments used in the determination
of reported results are continuously evaluated.

Assumptions, estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and on various other factors
that management believes to be reasonable in the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have discussed the development and selection
of these critical accounting policies and estimates with our independent auditors and the following
assumptions, estimates and judgments are considered important to understand our financial position.
Our significant accounting policies are set out in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
included in note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

_Revenue recognition_

Revenue is reported net of sales tax, such as value added tax and comprises primarily ticket and
concession sales and screen advertising income. Revenue from ticket sales is reported in the period in
which the film is shown. Income from screen advertising guaranteed income is recognized evenly over
the period to which it relates. Other screen advertising income is recognized as generated via contracts
with third party sales houses. In the United Kingdom, our contract is with DCM, a third party sales house
which administers screen advertising revenues on behalf of a large proportion of the United Kingdom
cinema market. In Germany, our main contractor for screen advertising is the company WerbeWeischer.
Concession revenue is recognized at the time of sale.

_Impairment of fixed assets_

The need for any fixed asset impairment provision is assessed by comparison of the carrying value of an
income generating unit, which normally comprises the portfolio of cinemas that operate within a market
place, against a value in use or net realizable value that is lower than the net book value. The value in use
has been calculated using a discounted cash flow methodology in accordance with applicable Financial
Reporting Standards.

The discounting rate used in assessing the value in use of the assets is the estimated weighted average
cost of capital employed by us, adjusted as necessary for any particular risks of the subsidiary being
reviewed. The weighted average cost of capital employed by us has been calculated as the weighted
average of the internal rate of return applied in the equity funding and our bank debt interest rate.

There have been no significant impairments made of fixed assets. However, events or circumstances
could arise which may result in a theater’s asset carrying value to not be recoverable.

_Intangible assets_

Goodwill is the difference between the aggregate of the fair value of those separately identifiable assets
and liabilities acquired and the fair value of the purchase consideration.

Goodwill is capitalized and amortized over its useful life, which in the opinion of the directors is 20 years.
It is reviewed for impairment at the end of the first full financial year following acquisition and in other
periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

107


-----

_Pensions_

Pension contributions (which are made to a defined contribution Group Personal Pension Plan) are
charged to the profit and loss account as incurred. These contributions are invested separately from the
Group’s assets.

_Operating lease arrangements_

Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred. Lease incentives are
amortized over the shorter of the period to the next rent review date or over the remaining term of the
lease.

_Finance lease arrangements_

Where we enter into a lease which entails taking substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an
asset, the lease is treated as a ‘‘finance lease.’’ The asset is recorded in the balance sheet as a tangible
fixed asset and is depreciated over its estimated useful life or the term of the lease, whichever is shorter.
Future installments under such leases, net of finance charges, are included within creditors. Rentals
payable are apportioned between the finance element, which is charged to the profit and loss account,
and the capital element, which reduces the outstanding obligation for future installments.

_Current and deferred taxation_

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period using tax rates enacted or
substantially enacted at the balance sheet date, together with any adjustment in respect of tax payable
for previous periods. Deferred tax is recognized in respect of all timing differences that have originated
but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to
pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognized only when, on the basis of
all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits
against which to recover carried forward tax losses and from which the future reversal of underlying
timing differences can be deducted. Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected
to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse based on tax rates and
laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is
measured on a non-discounted basis.

_Pre-opening and initial cinema development expenses_

In accordance with accounting pronouncement Urgent Issues Task Force (‘‘UITF’’) Abstract 24—
‘‘Accounting for Start up Costs,’’ pre-opening costs are written off in the period in which they are
incurred.

Expenditure of a capital nature, as set out in Financial Reporting Standard (‘‘FRS’’) 15—‘‘Tangible Fixed
Assets,’’ is capitalized from the date on which the Board approves the development of the cinema site.

_Onerous leases_

Provision is made for onerous leases where it is considered that the unavoidable costs of the lease
obligations are in excess of the economic benefits expected to be received by it. The unavoidable costs
of the lease reflect the net cost of exiting from the contract and are measured as the lower of the net
present value of the cost of continuing to operate the lease and any penalties or other costs of exiting
from it.

**BUSINESS**

**Overview**

We believe we are Europe’s second largest cinema operator by number of screens with operations
predominantly in the United Kingdom and Germany. We have grown our portfolio through a combination
of new cinema developments and acquisitions of cinemas in the United Kingdom and internationally. We
currently operate 115 cinemas with 1,072 screens located across six countries. In addition, we have
recently entered into an agreement to acquire Multikino, the second-largest cinema operator in Poland
by number of screens. After the completion of the Multikino Acquisition, we will operate 145 cinemas
with 1,318 screens located across nine countries.

We believe our cinema portfolio in the United Kingdom represents the newest, most modern chain of
cinemas in the country. In the United Kingdom, 98% of our cinemas are multiplexes, 94% have stadium
seating and all are fully digital. We also recently completed the acquisition of Apollo in the United
Kingdom to strengthen our position in the United Kingdom and to take advantage of certain economies
of scale. After disposing of five cinemas with 27 screens, the Apollo acquisition added nine cinemas with
56 screens to our portfolio, all of which have stadium seating and are fully digital, modern multiplexes. In
the United Kingdom, all of our cinemas use Sony Digital Cinema 4K digital projection technology, which
provides eight times the resolution of 2K digital projectors. We have a broad reach in the United Kingdom
and we estimate that over 60% of the population lives within a 30-minute drive of a Vue cinema.
According to Rentrak/EDI, our GBOR market share in the United Kingdom was approximately 24% for
the year ended December 31, 2012. We operate six of the top 20 grossing box office cinemas in the
United Kingdom, with a strong presence in the key London and West End markets, including our
Westfield London site which was the highest grossing box office cinema in the United Kingdom for the
53 weeks ended April 4, 2013.

We have leveraged our strong operational knowledge and experience with successful integrations of
acquisitions, primarily in the United Kingdom, to enter new European markets through selective strategic
acquisitions of leading cinema operators. These European markets are generally more fragmented and
less developed than the United Kingdom and we believe they offer opportunities for consolidation and
growth. In August 2012, we established our presence in Germany and Denmark through the acquisition
of CinemaxX, Germany’s second largest cinema operator by number of screens. Our cinemas in
Germany are typically situated in premium city center locations within the 20 largest German cities where
population densities are highest. We believe that all of our German cinemas offer state-of-the-art facilities
and, after completion of our digital rollout program by the end of July 2013, all of our cinemas in
Germany will have 4K digital projection technology. We also are seeking to expand into Poland, Latvia
and Lithuania through the acquisition of Poland’s second largest cinema operator by number of screens,
Multikino. Approximately 97% of Multikino’s cinemas are multiplexes and all are fully digital. In addition,
we operate a 14-screen cinema in Dublin, Ireland, a 9-screen cinema in Faro, Portugal and a 16-screen
cinema in Taipei, Taiwan, each of which is a multiplex cinema and has stadium seating.

On a pro forma basis, assuming the CinemaxX Acquisition and Multikino Acquisition had occurred on
April 5, 2012, our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA for the 53 weeks ended April 4, 2013 would have been
£588.0 million and £110.3 million, respectively. In addition, we would have had approximately
67.1 million admissions to our cinemas. See ‘‘Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information.’’

**Our Competitive Strengths**

We believe the following competitive strengths position us strongly in our markets:

**_A Leading Market Position in Highly Attractive European Markets_**

We believe we are Europe’s second largest cinema operator by number of screens. Upon completion of
the Multikino Acquisition, we will operate in nine countries and will be the only major cinema operator
with a market leading presence in both Western and Eastern Europe, which we believe positions us to
take advantage of the stability of markets in Western Europe while also offering the ability to capitalize on
growing markets in Eastern Europe. The majority of our cinemas are located in the United Kingdom and
Germany, which are the largest and third largest cinema markets in Europe by GBOR, respectively. We
are one of the top three cinema operators in the United Kingdom by GBOR and one of the top two
cinema operators in Germany as measured by number of screens. According to Dodona Research, in
the United Kingdom, total market GBOR grew from approximately £944 million in 2009 to approximately

109


-----

£1,099 million in 2012 and in Germany total market GBOR grew from approximately e976 million in 2009
to approximately e963 million in 2012. In Poland, Multikino is the second largest cinema operator as
measured by number of screens. In Poland, total GBOR grew from approximately PLN 681 million in
2009 to approximately PLN 711 million in 2012 according to Dodona Research. We believe these
markets should continue to grow and provide opportunities for increasing our revenue.

Our operations in multiple attractive European markets provide us with certain economies of scale and
the benefits of operating leverage across markets. We believe our multi-territory presence across select
attractive markets mitigates film revenue fluctuations and improves our negotiating position with our key
commercial counterparties, including film distributors, concessions suppliers, landlords, technology
providers and advertisers who we believe consider us a valuable and important partner. We believe that
our established relationships have enabled us to secure commercially attractive contract terms with
leading international suppliers. For example, we recently extended our relationship with Sony Digital
Cinema outside of the United Kingdom to Germany and Denmark, where they will be providing their 4K
digital technology to our CinemaxX cinemas. We believe we are now Sony Digital Cinema’s largest
customer outside of the United States. We believe the available choices, flexibility and caliber of our
commercial partners enhance our consumer offering, brand image and positioning.

**_Conveniently Located, High Quality Venues and Modern, State-of-the-Art Cinema Facilities_**

We believe our cinemas are well-located to maximize potential admissions. For example, we estimate
that over 60% of the population in the United Kingdom lives within a 30-minute drive of a Vue cinema. We
also have cinemas in the United Kingdom that are situated in flagship commercial locations with high
foot fall, such as Westfield London, Westfield Stratford City and Leicester Square. In Germany, our
cinemas are typically situated in premium city center locations within the 20 largest German cities where
population densities are highest.

We believe that we operate one of the most modern and technologically advanced cinema portfolios in
Europe. In the United Kingdom, 98% of our cinemas are multiplexes, which allows for greater film
flexibility in terms of time, format and selection and provides certain cost efficiencies as employee
staffing per screen in multiplexes is typically lower as compared with non-multiplex cinemas. In the
United Kingdom, 94% of our screens have stadium seating, which provides unobstructed views of the
screen, and all of our cinemas are fully digital, which provides consistent presentation quality to
customers and greater flexibility in terms of content for cinema operators. Across the Group, following
the completion of the Multikino Acquisition, 97% of our cinemas will be multiplexes and 94% of our
cinemas will have stadium seating. In addition, we believe that the average age of our cinemas in the
United Kingdom is lower than that of our primary competitors. In Germany, we have continued to invest
in refurbishment in recent years and plan to complete the process of upgrading all of our German
cinemas to 4K digital projection technology by the end of July 2013. In the United Kingdom, we also
have developed a proprietary super-sized screen format, Vue Xtreme, which allows us to show largescreen content without paying royalties and licensing fees for alternative branded large-screen
technology.

**_Proven Operational Excellence_**

We apply a rigorous and analytical approach to our cinema operations where we focus on revenue
enhancement and cost optimization. For example, we constantly review our ticket pricing structure and
believe we have been able to increase our box office revenue in our cinemas in the United Kingdom
through recent changes to our pricing strategy, such as the introduction of ‘‘peak’’ and ‘‘off-peak’’
pricing and the introduction of our ‘‘Super Saver Tuesday’’ offer. Our pricing strategy also entails
increasing pricing flexibility by cinema location based on variables including time of day, day of the week
and type of customer for each film, resulting in ticket price increases in certain circumstances and in
increased use of discounts in others. We aim to maximize revenue by offering premium propositions,
such as VIP seating in the United Kingdom or differentiated costs by seating location in Germany, for
customer segments that value these elements while selectively using discounts, such as ‘‘Kids AM’’ to
drive admissions volume. These strategies have positively impacted our average ticket price. We also
analyze film scheduling in order to deliver the ‘‘right’’ film, on the ‘‘right’’ screen at the ‘‘right’’ time in
order to achieve optimal attendance. Film scheduling changes have been systematically tested and
have driven increases in our admissions and box office revenue while decreasing variable staff costs as
compared to a control group of our cinemas.

110


-----

We also improved our cost structure by applying best practices across our cinemas. For example, we
have applied a disciplined approach to our cost components by employing competitive tendering
processes, for both capital expenditures and for supply costs. We also seek to manage our staff costs in
order to match, to the extent possible, staffing levels with admissions levels. We also renegotiate our
lease costs where possible and have invested in energy savings initiatives to reduce electricity and other
utility costs across our cinemas. We have also optimized costs by leveraging our pan-European platform
to establish strong relationships with key suppliers such as Sony Digital Cinema.

Additionally, for the 53 weeks ended November 29, 2012, our capital expenditures (net of landlord
contributions) were £21.7 million, which includes CinemaxX and Apollo following their acqusitions, but
excludes Multikino. We expect capital expenditures in 2013 and 2014 to be less than £40 million per
annum (net of landlord contributions, including the full-year effect of CinemaxX and Apollo and including
Multikino). We believe a significant portion of our capital expenditure investments is discretionary.

**_Track Record of Profitable Growth_**

We have grown our cinema portfolio through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions across
geographies. Since November 2005, we have developed 17 new cinemas with 165 screens in the United
Kingdom. We believe we have been able to maximize operating results in terms of total admissions,
average ticket price, concession spend per person and return on investment by strategically selecting
the ‘‘right’’ place, building the ‘‘right’’ size and paying the ‘‘right’’ rent for our new builds. For example,
our new cinemas range from Vue Stratford City in London, which is a 17-screen, 63,500 square-foot,
state-of-the-art multiplex as part of an approximately £1.5 billion commercial development project for the
2012 London Olympics, to Vue Halifax, which is a 9-screen, 27,100 square-foot cinema located within an
approximately £55 million mixed use development project in Halifax town center. As a result of this
rigorous approach to capital expenditure, since 2006, we have progressively reduced the average
number of years to pay back our initial investment in new cinema developments.

We believe we have grown our GBOR market share in the United Kingdom faster than our primary
competitors over the last five years. Further, we believe that in the United Kingdom as a result of the
quality of our cinemas and our focus on efficient utilization of our screens and the timing and placement
of films, we have on average over the last five years earned higher GBOR per screen than our primary
competitors.

We believe we have extensive experience and a successful track record of value accretive acquisitions.
These acquisitions have allowed us to consolidate in our existing markets and expand into new markets
in Europe that are attractive because they remain fragmented and have significant growth potential. We
believe our selective and disciplined approach has resulted in tangible operating performance gains for
our acquisitions. Target acquisitions need to demonstrate clear financial and strategic logic in terms of
payback targets and investment hurdles, and a potential for operational improvement and accelerated
growth. The table below summarizes our acquisitions since 2003.

**_Attractive Business Model with Strong Revenue and Cash Generation Capabilities_**

We believe our business model is attractive with strong revenue and cash generation capabilities due to
our critical position in the film distribution chain and the film industry’s historic resilience. Cinema
operators are an integral component of revenue generation for film distributors. According to the British
Film Institute 2012 Statistical Yearbook, approximately 26% of a film’s total revenue in the United
Kingdom is earned in cinemas. According to the Cinema Exhibitors’ Association, in the United Kingdom,
the amount of time a film is exclusively licensed for cinematic display prior to licensing for other
distribution channels has generally stabilized over the last five years leading to a more stable and
predictable revenue stream. Furthermore, a successful cinema release supports a film’s revenue
generation in channels after its initial theatrical release, such as DVD, Blu-ray, pay-per-view and cable.

We believe attending the cinema remains one of the most popular and affordable out-of-home
entertainment options for consumers. The market has been relatively resilient even during economic
downturns. For example, based on GDP data from the IMF and GBOR data from the Cinema Exhibitors’
Association and the Germany Federal Film Board, as real GDP decreased in the United Kingdom and
Germany, respectively, between 2007 and 2009, GBOR increased over the same period in both these
markets. We believe our conveniently located, state-of-the art cinemas, as well as our strong market
positions in the United Kingdom and Germany, have enabled us to maintain stable and consistent cash
flows. In addition, we offer premium propositions to customers, such as VIP seating, 3D and our supersized screen format, Vue Xtreme, to generate revenue, while selectively using discounts to drive
admissions volume. As a result, our average admissions levels and average ticket prices have remained
relatively stable, including during the most recent economic downturn.

We believe our attractive business model has resulted in strong revenue and cash flow generation. We
also have a history of delevering. After both the management buyout backed by Bank of Scotland
Integrated Finance in 2006 and our acquisition in 2010 by Doughty Hanson, we maintained strong cash
flow generation and were able to successfully delever.

**_Experienced Founder-led Senior Management Supported by Committed Shareholders_**

We were founded by our CEO, Tim Richards, in 1998 who was joined by our deputy CEO and CFO, Alan
McNair, in 1999 and our COO, Steve Knibbs, in 2003. This senior management team has over 80 years of
combined experience in the film industry and has grown the Company from six cinemas at the end of
2002 to 145 cinemas, upon the completion of the Multikino Acquisition. This team has also successfully
integrated over 23 newly developed sites and 130 acquired sites since the founding of the Company.
Our senior management remains significantly invested in the company and has reinvested at each stage
of ownership change. We also expect to derive further benefit from the experience and financial support
of OMERS and AIMCo, two of the largest and most experienced institutional investors in Canada, who
both have extensive operational experience in Europe and North America.

**Our Strategy**

**_Continue to Focus on Operational Discipline and Excellence Across our Cinema Portfolio_**

We have emphasized data-driven analytical rigor throughout our organization, and intend to continue to
do so, in order to make sound, evidence-based, informed decisions at all levels. We believe this has
been a key strength in the past and we plan to continue to extend these best-practices to our acquired
cinemas in Germany, Denmark, and upon completion of the Multikino Acquisition, Poland, Latvia and
Lithuania.

We will continue to focus on our operational strengths where historically we have been successful. For
example, in 2012, in order to improve film scheduling, we analyzed and identified key drivers and
conducted controlled scheduling trials at 24 cinemas in the United Kingdom for nine weeks. As a result,
we were able to implement strategic changes that increased admissions and revenue at these cinemas
while decreasing variable staff costs. We then rolled out these strategies throughout our United Kingdom
cinemas and plan to do the same across our cinema portfolio to deliver the ‘‘right’’ film, on the ‘‘right’’
screen, at the ‘‘right’’ time. We believe this approach to film scheduling should allow us to continue to
increase film revenue across all of our operations. We also intend to continue to focus on improving our
pricing strategy by increasing pricing flexibility to provide greater options for our customers and to
expand upon certain premium propositions, such as adding VIP seating in Germany.

112


-----

We also intend to continue to apply a disciplined approach to all of our cost components. We have
controlled our costs through a combination of competitive tendering processes, for both capital
expenditures and for supply costs, which we intend to apply across our entire cinema portfolio. We also
plan to continue our flexible staffing strategy to adjust employee-related costs in response to variations
in admissions levels and to continue to invest in energy savings initiatives to reduce electricity and other
utility costs across our cinemas. We also plan to renegotiate lease terms to reduce rental costs where
possible. We believe we can continue to apply these costs strategies across our historical cinema
portfolio and implement these practices across our acquired cinemas. We also intend to continue to
incentivize certain managers and staff with bonuses based on profitability.

**_Pursue Growth Opportunities_**

We are focused on cash flow maximization and enhancing our industry leadership. We plan to pursue
growth opportunities from our existing cinemas by attracting new customers and maximizing revenue
from existing customers, opening new cinemas in the near term, as well as continue to evaluate and
pursue selective acquisitions.

We seek to provide a wide range of customer propositions from value offers to premium offers in order to
both attract new customers and maximize revenue from existing customers. We plan to continue to
deliver an innovative cinema experience, with packaged, branded and tailored offerings supported by
high quality standards that drive and protect revenue streams. For example, in the United Kingdom, we
have ‘‘Kids AM’’ for children as well as ‘‘Over 18s Screenings’’ for adults. We also intend to screen film
and alternative content to improve utilization generally in periods of low film demand and to provide
unique content offerings for customers, such as opera, concerts, ballet and sporting events at premium
pricing levels.

We believe a key component in customer choice is cinema location and our new cinema openings are
tailored for their specific catchment requirements. For example, we seek to develop cinemas in areas
with complementary services, such as in retail malls with restaurants and other leisure activities or in
areas with access to car parks. We actively monitor new cinema developments and maintain a shortlist
of potential locations. We intend to continue to apply rigorous analytics of local catchment population,
propensity to visit the cinema, income levels and local competition to ensure each cinema’s
configuration closely matches market capacity of the catchment area. We also believe that our
experiences managing landmark cinemas, such as Westfield London, Westfield Stratford City and
Leicester Square, and our experience in lease negotiation and capital expenditure control should enable
us to minimize development costs to achieve superior payback periods on new cinemas.

We will continue to seek value-enhancing growth based on disciplined and sustainable strategies,
including the careful evaluation, selection and pursuit of strategic opportunities throughout Europe. As
with our acquisitions in the United Kingdom and Germany, we may seek to acquire cinema operators in
Europe or elsewhere where we believe we can realize attractive returns on investment and generate
significant free cash flow. We believe that certain markets in Europe remain fragmented and with our
proven track record of identifying and integrating acquisitions successfully, we are well-placed to take
advantage of strategic opportunities.

**_Provide an Exceptional Cinema Experience Delivered by Friendly and Helpful Cinema Staff_**

We aim to be the first choice for cinema entertainment in our markets. We seek to continue to
differentiate our cinema experience by expanding and improving our customer propositions. In addition
to location and price, we believe that customers also choose cinemas based on the quality of the cinema
experience. We are focused on creating a consistent brand image, synonymous with a state-of-the-art
cinematic experience. We are also focusing on customer satisfaction in terms of ease of booking tickets,
premium viewing options and offering a wide range of concessions.

As the film industry produces franchise blockbusters that take advantage of premium formats such as
3D, we believe we can gain customers with our modern, state-of-the-art stadium-seated cinemas with
digital technology such as Sony Digital Cinema 4K, which differentiates our cinema offering from less
modern cinemas. We plan to continue to provide 3D formats and Vue Xtreme, which has super-sized
screens and enhanced sound systems, as well as completing our digital investment with Sony Digital
Cinema to provide 4K technology to our customers in Germany and Denmark.

113


-----

We also plan to continue our emphasis on customer choice in terms of pricing, film selection and
amenities. For example, we intend to continue offering in the United Kingdom and across our cinema
portfolio both premium pricing options such as VIP seating where customers can enjoy larger, more
luxurious seating in prime locations in the auditorium, as well as customer discount propositions such as
‘‘Kids AM’’ and ‘‘Super Saver Tuesday’’ in the United Kingdom. In addition, we intend to continue to offer
customer propositions like internet booking and mobile applications that allow customers greater
flexibility and ease in purchasing their tickets.

We plan to continue to emphasize customer satisfaction and focus on training and motivating our
employees to provide an exceptional cinema experience. For example, we have cinema incentive plans
that reward employees based on cinema profitability and customer service standards. We also provide
our cinema employees with a modular training program that covers all aspects of running a cinema,
including cinema management. Additionally, in order to gain critical customer insight, we employ a
number of internal and external sources that provide detailed pictures of customer behavior, trends and
attitudes. Listening to customers and understanding their behavior is core to our ability to deliver
successful new offers, enhance existing offers and to better predict demand in the future. We actively
track customer service metrics to check we are delivering high quality service to our customers with our
friendly and helpful staff. We intend to extend these customer-focused training and tracking initiatives to
our newly acquired cinemas.

**History**

We were founded by our CEO, Tim Richards, in 1998. Tim’s business partner, current deputy CEO and
CFO, Alan McNair joined him in 1999. Both had extensive prior senior management experience in the
industry in the United Kingdom and internationally. The company was set up as Spean Bridge
International Cinemas (SBC) with the support of Boston Ventures, a venture capital fund, and by the end
of 2002, had opened four cinemas in the United Kingdom, one in Portugal and one in Taiwan.

In 2003, SBC acquired Warner Village Cinema’s U.K. circuit, which comprised 36 cinemas with 353
screens. Funds for the acquisition were provided by the existing investor and new investors. Following
this acquisition, SBC changed its name to Vue Entertainment and became the operator of the second
largest cinema chain by number of screens in the United Kingdom. The combined 400-screen
state-of-the-art stadium seating multiplex cinema portfolio including the flagship Leicester Square
cinema was fully rebranded as ‘‘Vue’’ within six months. The Vue portfolio continued to grow both
organically and through a series of acquisitions including the acquisition of Ster Century in 2005, which
at the time operated the highest grossing cinema in the United Kingdom and Ireland at the Liffey Valley
Shopping Centre in Dublin.

In 2006, we completed a management buyout backed by Bank of Scotland Integrated Finance and
simultaneously acquired the five cinemas we had been managing under contract for Village Roadshow.
Between 2006 and the end of 2010, we developed an additional 14 cinemas in the United Kingdom,
adding 133 screens to the portfolio and acquired Hoyts’ 6-screen Wood Green cinema, bringing our
portfolio to 70 cinemas and 679 screens.

Between 2010 to 2011, we achieved several significant milestones including opening two marketleading cinemas in London, our 14-screen cinema at Vue Westfield London in 2010 and our 17-screen
cinema at Vue Westfield Stratford City in 2011, which were the number one and five cinemas,
respectively, in the United Kingdom for the 53 weeks ended April 4, 2013, as measured by GBOR. During
that time, we were acquired by Doughty Hanson at the end of 2010. In 2012, we completed the
acquisition of Apollo in the United Kingdom and CinemaxX in Germany and Denmark. Apollo added nine
cinemas and 56 screens in the United Kingdom after disposal of five cinemas with 27 screens, further
strengthening our position in the United Kingdom. CinemaxX represents our first significant international
acquisition, adding 34 cinemas located in Germany and Denmark to our portfolio. More recently, we
have entered into an agreement to acquire Multikino in Poland, which will make us the only cinema
operator with a market-leading presence across both Western and Eastern Europe.

**Our Markets and Competition**

Our principal markets are the United Kingdom, Germany and, after the completion of the Multikino
Acquisition, Poland. We also operate cinemas in Denmark, Ireland, Portugal and Taiwan and, after
completion of the Multikino Acquisition, Latvia and Lithuania.

Cinema remains an integral channel for distribution of films in terms of revenue for film production
companies. Cinema is also vital in establishing a film’s value when marketed through other channels,
such as network, rental, cable and satellite television, in-home television, DVDs, video-on-demand,
pay-per-view services or streaming and downloads via the Internet. Cinema has exhibited relatively
limited long-term admissions volatility and has demonstrated GBOR growth over the last decade despite
competing technologies and economic downturns. Additionally, GBOR has also typically been resilient
to macroeconomic fluctuations. For example, based on GDP data from the IMF and GBOR data from the
Cinema Exhibitors’ Association and the Germany Federal Film Board, as real GDP decreased in the
United Kingdom and Germany, respectively, between 2007 and 2009, GBOR increased over the same
period in both these markets.

Cinemas are subject to varying degrees of competition in the geographic areas in which they operate.
Competition on the individual cinema level focuses on attracting and retaining customers, and
competition on the cinema operator level focuses on achieving favorable film licensing terms, pricing
strategies and finding new cinemas sites. The cinema industry also faces competition for customers’
leisure time and disposable income from other forms of out-of-home entertainment, including sporting
events, music concerts, theater, restaurants and family leisure attractions such as theme parks. Cinemas
also compete, to a lesser degree, with other in-home distribution channels for filmed entertainment, such
as cable television, film rentals, pay-per-view and home video systems.

The cinema and film industry are in the process of converting from celluloid film-based media to digital
media. Digital media provides a superior visual experience for customers, and allows for greater
flexibility in content programming as it allows operators to present additional formats, such as digital 3D,
and pre-recorded materials for corporate bookings and alternative content including sporting and
cultural events. Digital media also allows for greater flexibility in scheduling as changing from one film to
another, or from one content to another, is easier than with celluloid film.

**_United Kingdom_**

The cinema market in the United Kingdom is the largest in Europe in terms of GBOR and is relatively
consolidated. The top three cinema operators in the United Kingdom are Cineworld, Odeon and Vue.
The market also has smaller multiplex operators and independent cinema operators, which generally
operate non-multiplex cinemas. According to Rentrak/EDI, our GBOR market share in the United
Kingdom was approximately 24% for 2012.

According to Dodona Research, the United Kingdom has high multiplex penetration with approximately
75% of all screens being in multiplex cinemas. Cinema operators have, in recent years, invested heavily
in digital conversion, with 92% of screens in the United Kingdom converted to digital as of December 31,
2012, compared to 17.5% as of December 31, 2009, according to the Cinema Exhibitors’ Association.

The table below shows GBOR, admissions, gross average ticket price and number of screens in the
United Kingdom for the following calendar years:

**_Germany_**

The cinema market in Germany is the third largest in Europe in terms of GBOR and is relatively
fragmented. Other than our acquisition of CinemaxX in 2012, the last significant event in market
development was UCI Kinowelt’s acquisition of KPE Multiplextheater in 2008. The top three cinema
operators in Germany, according to Dodona Research, are Cinestar, CinemaxX and UCI, with a
combined holding of less than a quarter of screens for the year ended December 31, 2012.

Despite significant waves of investment in the 1990s and the early 2000s with new market entrants,
according to Dodona Research, multiplex penetration remains low at approximately 28% of all screens
in Germany. According to Dodona Research, with approximately 25% of Germans living more than 25
kilometers from a multiplex, multiplex accessibility is also low. However, despite the relatively low
multiplex penetration and accessibility, according to Dodona Research, multiplexes represent
approximately 48% of admissions in Germany, which we believe demonstrates their attractiveness to
customers and, as a result, provides an opportunity for new cinema development. The total number of
screens in Germany has been decreasing as a result of the phase-out of traditional cinemas. Cinema
operators in Germany continue to convert to digital technology, though at a slower rate than in the United
Kingdom, with only 65% of screens in Germany converted to digital as of December 31, 2012, according
to Media Salles.

The majority of cinema admissions in Germany are to international films; however local Germanlanguage films also drive admissions. According to Dodona Research, approximately 100 Germanlanguage films are released each year and generally account for approximately 20% of total German
admissions.

**_Poland_**

The cinema market in Poland is the second largest cinema market in Central and Eastern Europe
(excluding Turkey) by GBOR and is relatively consolidated, according to Media Salles. The top three
cinema operators in Poland are Cinema City, Multikino and Helios, combined accounting for
approximately 85% of admissions, according to Dodona Research.

According to Dodona Research, approximately 62% of all screens are in multiplex cinemas in Poland.
Admissions have generally increased in line with increasing multiplex accessibility according to Dodona
Research.

The majority of cinema admissions in Poland are to international films, however local Polish-language
films also drive admissions, which, on average, account for approximately 20% of admissions,
according to Dodona Research. Each of the three main cinema operators, including Multikino, also
distributes Polish-language films to the market.

**Our Cinemas**

We currently operate 115 cinemas with 1,072 screens across six countries. In the United Kingdom and
Ireland, we operate under the Vue brand. After the completion of the Multikino Acquisition, we will
operate 145 cinemas with 1,318 screens located across nine countries. In Germany, we operate under
the CinemaxX brand and expect to operate under the Multikino brand in Poland, Latvia and Lithuania
upon completion of the Multikino Acquisition. In Portugal and Taiwan, we continue to operate under our
original SBC brand.

The significant majority of our cinemas are in the United Kingdom, Germany, and after completion of the
Multikino Acquisition, Poland. Denmark is managed as part of the CinemaxX portfolio of cinemas
acquired in August 2012 and Portugal and Taiwan are managed as part of our Vue cinema portfolio. As
part of the Multikino Acquisition, we will acquire a cinema in each of Latvia and Lithuania, which would be
managed as part of the Multikino portfolio of cinemas.

Below is a summary of our cinemas in each of the countries where we operate as of April 4, 2013:

**_The United Kingdom_**

We are the third largest cinema operator in the United Kingdom by GBOR. We have grown our cinema
chain in the United Kingdom through new cinema developments and strategic acquisitions. Our
cinemas are also situated in flagship commercial locations with high foot fall, such as Westfield London,
Westfield Stratford City and Leicester Square. For the 53 weeks ended April 4, 2013, Vue Westfield
London and Vue Westfield Stratford City were the number one and five cinemas, respectively, according
to Rentrak/EDI in the United Kingdom as measured by GBOR. Our cinemas are located across the
United Kingdom, with a larger presence in London and other metropolitan areas. In the United Kingdom,
all of our cinemas offer VIP seating where customers can enjoy larger, more luxurious seating in prime
locations in the auditorium, and Vue Xtreme, which has larger screens and enhanced sound systems.
Vue Xtreme is our proprietary large-screen format, which we designed internally and use without having
to pay royalties and licensing fees for alternative branded large-screen technology.

**_Germany_**

We are the second largest cinema operator in Germany by number of screens. Our cinemas in the
German market, which operate under the CinemaxX brand, are similar to our Vue cinemas in the United
Kingdom as we believe they are high quality, modern multiplexes with stadium seating. Our cinemas in
Germany are in premium city center locations, and we are located in the 20 largest cities where
population densities are highest. Approximately 90% of our cinemas in Germany are sites that CinemaxX
designed and developed with the remainder acquired from third parties. We believe these cinemas are
state-of-the-art facilities and consequently we are able to provide our customers with what we believe to

117

be an enhanced viewing experience. In addition, CinemaxX has spent over e30 million in refurbishment
and upgrades relating to digitization, sound, seating and flooring since 2009. In Germany, we offer a
number of premium options, including films in 3D (MAXXIMUM 3D), films with premium sound
(MAXXIMUM Sound) and films delivered at a higher frame rate (MAXXIMUM HFR).

**_Poland_**

Multikino is the second largest cinema operator in Poland by number of screens. Multikino has been a
pioneer of multiplex cinemas in Poland since 1998 when it opened Poland’s first multiplex in Pozna´n.
Most of Multikino’s cinemas are located in Poland’s largest cities, where it is either the first or second
largest multiplex operator. Approximately 97% of Multikino’s cinemas are multiplexes and all are fully
digital. In addition, in Poland, Multikino is one of the top four leading independent film distributors.

**Digital Technology and 3D**

**_Digital Technology_**

We completed our 4K digital projection rollout program for our cinemas in the United Kingdom and
Ireland in August 2012 and we expect to complete our 4K digital rollout program for our cinemas in
Germany and Denmark by the end of July 2013. All of Multikino’s cinemas in Poland are fully digital.

Digital technology provides improved presentation quality to customers and lower costs to the film
distributor as a result of not having to manufacture and deliver actual physical film prints to cinema
operators. To help cinema operators finance the cost of conversion to digital projection, film distributors
pay fees, generally referred to as ‘‘virtual print fees,’’ to operators (or third party intermediaries) based on
films presented on approved digital projection platforms. Film distributors pay virtual print fees until a
cost recoupment date or threshold has been reached. Multikino continues to receive the benefit of virtual
print fees paid directly by film distributors while in other regions where we operate, such as the United
Kingdom and Germany, virtual print fees are received by intermediaries. In particular, we have
contracted with Sony Digital Cinema to convert our 35mm projection equipment in the United Kingdom
and Germany to digital projection equipment. As part of the shared financing of the conversion, Sony
Digital Cinema will receive virtual print fees from film distributors for the projectors for the next ten years
or until they recoup their investment in the digital conversion.

We were an early adopter of 4K technology across our cinemas in the United Kingdom and Ireland
through a strategic partnership with Sony Digital Cinema. 4K technology has an eight-times higher pixel
count than the alternative, lower quality, 2K digital technology, which provides a lower quality picture. We
believe our digital proposition in the United Kingdom is technologically superior to our competitors’ 2K
digital capabilities and provides us with a competitive advantage, particularly as an increasing number of
movies are filmed in 4K. Furthermore, our strategic partnership with Sony Digital Cinema allowed us to
secure favorable terms with attractive pricing. We extended our relationship with Sony Digital Cinema for
the rollout of 4K projectors and other digital technology in our cinemas in Germany and Denmark, after
the acquisition of CinemaxX in 2012.

**_3D_**

In the United Kingdom, 3D has grown from five 3D films released in 2008 to 44 3D films released in 2012,
and 3D film quality continues to improve as films are increasingly produced specifically for 3D. We
expect the number of films to be released in the 3D format in the next year to be broadly consistent with
2012 levels. We believe 3D-equipped screens provide us with flexibility in film scheduling and provides
our customers with increased choice. Typically we schedule 3D films to enable customers to choose
from different film formats, such as between 2D and 3D, as well as among other films. Our investment in
3D in the United Kingdom has focused on return on investment and incremental revenue increase from
3D screen capability instead of focusing on a full 3D roll-out across all of our screens. As a result, we
believe we have been able to achieve a higher share of 3D GBOR per 3D screen than our primary
competitors.

As of April 4, 2013, 30.6% of our United Kingdom screens were equipped with 3D technology, which
accounted for 20% of total GBOR for the twelve months ended April 4, 2013. In Germany 56% of our
screens are equipped with 3D technology and in Poland 85% of Multikino’s screens are equipped with
3D technology. The variation in 3D screen penetration across our cinemas is a function of legacy
investment decisions while CinemaxX and Multikino were under previous ownership.

-----

**Film Licensing**

We license ‘‘first-run’’ motion pictures on a film-by-film and cinema-by-cinema basis from both film
distributors owned by major film production companies and from independent film distributors. We pay
our film license costs to film distributors typically based on a percentage of box office revenue (net of
value added tax), which we negotiate directly with the film distributor. Prior to negotiating terms for a film
license, we evaluate the prospects for that film. Criteria considered for each film include: cast, director,
plot, performance of similar films and estimated film revenues. We believe that successful licensing
depends on knowledge of the historical trends and preferences of customers in a particular market. For
example, the German and Polish markets tend to generate larger demand for locally produced films. As
a result, we have a film-buying director in each of our main geographical regions who chooses content
and negotiates licensing terms.

**Box Office Revenues**

Ticket sales are our largest source of revenue. We charge premiums for 3D movies, VIP seating, and Vue
Xtreme. We also charge certain premiums in Germany, as is standard in the market, for longer films or
Higher Frame Rate films, such as _The Hobbit. Most of our cinemas also offer discounted pricing for_
matinee shows, as well as for children, teens, families and senior citizens, such as our Kids AM program.

Most of our tickets are sold within the cinema immediately before the start of a film. However a growing
proportion of tickets are sold in advance, either over the phone or online, including on mobile devices.
For certain movies, online ticket sales can account for over 30% of those films’ sales in the first weekend
of release. We believe our advance sales improve customer satisfaction, allowing customers to
pre-select their seat location and to pick up their tickets at automated ticket machines located in our
cinemas.

**Concession**

Concession sales are our second largest source of revenue after box office revenue. We primarily focus
on traditional cinema offerings such as soft drinks, popcorn and confectionary. These items typically
have a higher gross margin than ticket sales.

We design our multiplex cinemas to have more space for concessions in order to make it easier to serve
large numbers of customers efficiently. We also strategically locate our concession stands within
cinemas to heighten their visibility, aid in reducing queues, allow flexibility to introduce products and
improve traffic flow around the concessions stands. In addition, our ‘‘ticket-at-any-till’’ system allows
customers to purchase tickets at the concession stands, thereby increasing opportunities to sell
concessions.

Examples of initiatives to increase concession sales and margins include optimizing product mix by
introducing new products, product sizes and introducing combination offers, training employees to
cross-sell and up-sell products, and implementing new pricing strategies and incentive schemes for
employees.

**Screen Advertising**

Screen advertising sales are our third largest source of revenue after box office revenue and
concessions. We sell ‘‘on-screen’’ time for advertisements shown before a film starts or during
intermissions for longer screenings and ‘‘off-screen’’ advertising which includes our billboard and foyer
advertising. We also sell advertising for our website. Screen advertising is a high margin revenue stream,
particularly as screen advertising continues to convert to digital formats as digital projector penetration
increases and digital advertising media is more easily produced and distributed. We expect screen
advertising to remain an important source of revenue for cinema operators.

In the United Kingdom, our screen advertising is sold by DCM, which is the market leader in United
Kingdom for cinema advertising. DCM sells screen time and other advertising media and capabilities to
advertisers on behalf of contracted operators including its shareholders, Odeon and Cineworld. In
addition to screen advertising, DCM also offers sponsorship, promotion and in-foyer poster advertising
services.

In Germany, we sell ‘‘on-screen’’ advertising both directly and through an agency, WerbeWeischer. In
Poland, Multikino sells ‘‘on-screen’’ advertising directly through Multikino Media.

119


-----

**Alternative Content, Film Distribution and Ancillary Services**

We also offer our customers alternative media content in our cinemas. We provide live and pre-recorded
content for music and sporting events, gaming and corporate presentations. In the United Kingdom, we
screen content for children, such as Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends and Pompeii Live from the British
Museum, as well as performances from the Royal Opera House. In Germany, we screen performances
from the Berliner Philharmoniker and Bolshoi theatre as well as sporting events such as the Champions
League final and the Super Bowl. In Poland, Multikino was the only cinema chain to feature Euro 2012
football matches and currently screens content such as operas, ballets and concerts, including,
Nabucco from Opera di Verona, Cinderella from the Dutch National Ballet and Giocconda live from
Opera de Paris.

In Poland, Multikino is also one of the top four leading independent film distributors.

In addition, we generate other ancillary revenue through booking fees for tickets, the leasing of screens
for private events and car-parking fees.

**Marketing and Advertising**

Multimedia advertising campaigns for major film releases are organized and financed primarily by film
distributors. To market our cinemas, we utilize advertisements, such as movie schedules published in
newspapers and over the internet to inform our customers of film selections and show times. We also
use social media for the same purpose. In the United Kingdom, we also publish a monthly free
magazine, ‘‘Vue Magazine’’ to provide customers with information on upcoming movie releases. In
addition, we seek to develop customer loyalty through a number of marketing programs. In the United
Kingdom, we have discounted family and senior tickets, ‘‘Super Saver Tuesday,’’ where we sell
discounted tickets on Tuesdays to customers who have signed up for a Super Saver Tuesday card,
‘‘Kids AM,’’ where we sell discounted tickets for children and adults on Saturday and Sunday mornings.
We also have premium offers, such as ‘‘Over 18s Screenings,’’ which are film screenings for adults only.
In both the United Kingdom and Poland, we offer ‘‘Orange Wednesday,’’ which allows two for one tickets
for Orange customers every Wednesday. We also have the CinemaxX Bonus Card in Germany and Club
CinemaxX in Denmark, which provide access to exclusive benefits including rewarding spending with
points that can be redeemed for tickets and concession items.

**Information Technology**

In the United Kingdom, our information technology is based on the Vista cinema operating system. The
point-of-sale terminals within each cinema in the United Kingdom provide comprehensive information to
our corporate office and to our cinema management in near-real time. Reports address all aspects of
cinema operations, including concessions sales, fraud detection and film booking. We gather payroll
information from our cinemas in the United Kingdom through the use of automated time keeping
systems, enabling a comparison of actual to budgeted labor for each cinema. Our systems allow us to
properly manage our hourly workforce and schedule the right films at the best times to suit our
customers.

We also operate a high traffic website, which receives approximately 5 million visits per month, for show
times, movie news, social media and ticket reservations. Our digital projection is integrated into our
United Kingdom information technology operations infrastructure, which we constantly monitor
remotely to maximize availability. We continue to integrate our Vista system, which is our overall
operating system, and our Sony Theatre Management systems, which control the operation of all digital
projectors in the circuit, to further enable operational efficiencies.

Our cinemas in Germany and, after the Multikino Acquisition, Poland, operate a variety of other systems,
such as COMPESO and AAM Theatre Management System. We plan on reviewing the possibility of
replacing these systems with a consistent platform to further enhance efficiencies for these cinemas.

**Employees**

As of April 4, 2013, we employed approximately 6,000 employees, of which approximately 78% were part
time and paid on an hourly wage. We seek to enable all of our employees to meet their short- and
long-term goals and we are committed to their development.

120


-----

In the United Kingdom and Ireland we have cinema incentive plans that reward employees based on
cinema profitability and customer service standards. We also provide our cinema employees with a
modular training program that covers all aspects of running a cinema, including cinema management. In
other countries, we have various elements of these initiatives in place.

In Germany we have several works councils, one joint works council and the VERDI union.
Notwithstanding the works councils in Germany, we do not operate any collective agreements in relation
to our workforce and there are no trade unions or other collective bodies recognized for bargaining
purposes. We believe our employee relations are good and have not experienced any material work
stoppages.

**Properties**

Most of our cinemas are occupied pursuant to leases. In general, our cinema leases are long-term, with
original terms typically ranging from 10 to 25 years with various renewal options, usually in intervals of
five years. The leases often require escalating minimum rent payments either yearly or every five years,
along with additional rent payments based on a percentage of the leased cinema’s revenue above a
base amount. They also require us to pay for property taxes, maintenance, insurance and certain other
property-related expenses. In Germany, some of our leases require us to give bank guarantees as
collateral to landlords.

In connection with our acquisition of the Warner Village U.K. Cinema Circuit in 2003, we entered into a
deed of undertaking and indemnity (the ‘‘Deed’’) in favor of Time Warner Entertainment Limited (‘‘Time
Warner’’) and VC Eye Pty Limited (‘‘Village’’). The Deed was entered into to offer protection to Time
Warner and Village in respect of liabilities which they retained pursuant to leases of certain properties
that we acquired but for which Time Warner and Village continue to be contingently liable (either as
guarantor or original tenant) by virtue of U.K. law. Under the terms of the Deed, Time Warner and Village
are entitled to require second ranking security behind all security that a lender receives in connection
with any of our financing arrangements. Time Warner and Village have taken second ranking charges
over some of our property assets but they have not requested any additional security since 2007.
Consequently, assets acquired since then are not charged in their favor.

We lease our corporate headquarters in Chiswick, United Kingdom.

**Regulation**

Regulators of film distribution are generally country governments. In some cases, regulations require the
films of certain film distributors to be offered and licensed to operators, including us, on a film-by-film and
cinema-by-cinema basis. As a result, we are not always able to secure a supply of films by entering into
long-term arrangements with major film distributors, but must compete for our licenses on a film-by-film
and cinema-by-cinema basis.

Depending on location, our operations are also subject to laws regulating such matters as the
construction, refurbishment and operation of cinemas as well as wages and working conditions,
citizenship, health and sanitation requirements. We are required to obtain licensing for, among other
things, the exhibition of films and the sale of alcoholic beverages. In addition, we are often subject to
registration requirements related to the sale of food products. We perform internal audits to maintain
compliance with local legal and ongoing reporting requirements.

**Environmental**

Our cinemas are subject to numerous supra-national, national and local environmental laws and
regulations. We believe that we are currently in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental
and safety regulations. These environmental, health and safety laws and regulations are constantly
changing, however, as are the priorities of those who enforce them. We cannot assure you that
environmental conditions relating to any of our prior, existing or future properties will not have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks
_Relating to Our Business and the Industry—We may be subject to liability under laws and regulations in_
_the jurisdictions in which we operate, including environmental laws and regulations.’’_

121


-----

**Insurance**

We maintain property insurance with respect to our operations that covers our cinemas. We also
maintain business interruption and other insurances. We believe that our insurance coverage is
customary for similar operations in our industry and is adequate for our business. However, we cannot
assure you that all losses and liabilities that we may incur would be recoverable.

**Litigation**

In the normal course of business, we are party to various legal actions, such as personal injury claims,
employment matters and contractual matters. Except as described below, we do not expect any liability
arising from any of these legal actions to have a material impact on our results of operations, liquidity,
capital resources or financial position. The outcome of legal actions, however, can be difficult to predict
with certainty, and we can offer no assurances in this regard.

In Portugal, our subsidiary, SBC Algarve has ceased paying monies due to its landlord under the lease
for its cinema site in Faro, Portugal due to poor trading results. VUEL, a dormant Vue company, has
provided a corporate guarantee in respect of SBC Algarve’s lease obligations subject to a cap of
e1.2 million (inclusive of VAT). Arrears now exceed e1 million (gross). The landlord has made two formal
demands to VEUL for payment of the outstanding monies. Negotiations with the landlord are ongoing,
and to date, no proceedings have been commenced against either SBC Algarve or VEUL. If agreement
with the landlord cannot be reached, then the landlord may pursue SBC Algarve and VEUL for monies
owed, and we may cease operating in Portugal and incur all costs associated with such closure. See
‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and the Industry—Potential liabilities and costs from
_litigation could adversely affect our business’’ and ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and the_
_Industry—We are subject to risk related to our leases.’’_

**MANAGEMENT**

**The Issuer**

The Issuer was formed as a private limited company under the laws of England and Wales on May 2,
2013 and was reregistered as a public limited company organized under the laws of England and Wales
on July 1, 2013, with a company number 8514872, and was formed to facilitate the Vue Acquisition. The
Issuer is wholly owned indirectly by Holdco which, following the Vue Acquisition, will be wholly-owned
by the AIMCo Entities, the OMERS Entities, the Executive Managers (and their close relatives) and
certain of Vue’s senior management. The directors of the Issuer are Simon Jones, Mark Redman, Peter
Teti and Robert Mah and may be contacted at the registered office of the Issuer. The Issuer’s registered
office is located at 6 New Street Square, New Fetter Lane, London EC4A 3BF. To the best of the Issuer’s
knowledge, no potential conflicts exist between any duties to the Issuer of the directors of the Issuer
listed above and their private interests or other duties in respect of their management roles.

**Vougeot Holdco Limited**

The Board of Directors of Vue Entertainment International Limited is currently responsible for the overall
management and performance of Vue and for defining and executing our strategy. However, upon

of Vue Entertainment International Limited, in addition to representatives from the AIMCo Entities and
OPE Vougeot Holdings Limited (one of the OMERS Entities).

The AIMCo Entities and OPE Vougeot Holdings Limited have the right to appoint directors to the board of
Holdco, the number of which depends upon the percentage of B shares they hold and for as long as
their total percentage of shareholding respectively, is not less than 18% of the B shares in issue.

expect will serve as directors of Holdco upon completion of the Vue Acquisition:

**CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

**Issuer Loan**

The Issuer will enter into shareholder loan agreements with Midco on or prior to the Vue Acquisition
Completion Date, pursuant to which Midco will extend up to approximately £433 million of loans to the
Issuer. In the event the Multikino Acquisition is not completed, based on the estimated sources and uses
of funds as at April 4, 2013, the amount of the Issuer Loan would be reduced by £28.4 million. The Issuer
Loan will have a maturity after the Notes, will be deeply subordinated pursuant to the Intercreditor
Agreement and will not be subject to any acceleration provisions or financial covenants. Midco will grant
security by way of assignment of its rights under the Issuer Loan in favor of the lenders under the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the holders of the Notes.

The majority of the proceeds for the Issuer Loan will have been advanced to Midco from Finco on or prior
to the Vue Acquisition Completion Date through an intercompany loan and/or share subscription. The
proceeds that Finco will provide to Midco will have been advanced to Finco by way of share subscription
by Holdco and/or an intercompany loan from Holdco and/or the issuance of the Loan Notes. The Loan
Notes will be 11% fixed rate unsecured notes issued by Finco to certain of the Executive Managers (and
their close relatives), certain of Vue’s senior management, the AIMCo Entities and OMERS. The Loan
Notes will rank pari passu with each other including on the payment of principal and interest.

The remainder of the Issuer Loan will arise on the acquisition by the Issuer of certain shares in Vue
Entertainment International Limited. Initially, pursuant to the Vue Acquisition Agreement, Holdco will
acquire certain shares in Vue Entertainment International Limited held by James Timothy Richards.
Shortly following the completion of the Vue Acquisition, the shares will be contributed by Holdco to
Finco, then by Finco to Midco and then by Midco to the Issuer. The consideration for the transfer by
Midco to the Issuer will be left outstanding as an intercompany loan.

**Bridge Loan**

Due to the timing of certain legal procedures relating to the Squeeze Out and the German Company
Conversion, the Restricted Cash will be inaccessible at the Vue Acquisition Completion Date.
Accordingly on or about the Vue Acquisition Completion Date, Midco will lend £34.1 million to the Issuer
pursuant to the Bridge Loan Agreement. The Bridge Loan will have a maturity after the Notes and will be
deeply subordinated pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement and will not be subject to any acceleration
provisions or financial covenants; however, the Intercreditor Agreement will permit payments to be
made by the Issuer in respect of the Bridge Loan to the extent such payments are permitted or not
prohibited under the RCF Facility Agreement and the Notes Documents (as defined in the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement). Midco will grant security by way of assignment of its rights under the Bridge
Loan in favor of the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the holders of the Notes.
The Bridge Loan will rank ahead of all shareholder equity of the Issuer. The proceeds that Midco will lend
to the Issuer pursuant to the Bridge Loan Agreement will be advanced to Midco from Finco pursuant to
an intercompany loan and/or share subscription. The proceeds that Finco will lend to Midco will have
been advanced to Finco pursuant to the issuance of the Bridge Loan Notes. The Bridge Loan Notes will
be 11% fixed rate unsecured notes issued by Finco to the AIMCo Entities and OMERS.

**Executive Manager Put Agreement**

The Executive Manager Put Agreement will be entered into by among others, Holdco, Midco, the
Executive Managers, the AIMCo Entities and the OMERS Entities that allows James Timothy Richards
and his immediate family member, Alan McNair and Stephen Knibbs (each an ‘‘Executive Put Party’’) to
serve notice on Holdco and Finco of their intention to exercise a put option, at any time following the five
year anniversary of the completion of the Vue Acquisition, provided that there is not a continuing or
imminent event of default in relation to the Group under its financing arrangements.

A year following such service of notice, the Executive Put Party will require: (1) Holdco to purchase,
repay or redeem up to a quarter (in the case of Alan McNair, up to one half of the C shares and all of his D
shares held by him) of his C and D shares held in Holdco; and (2) Finco to purchase, repay or redeem up
to a quarter (in the case of Alan McNair, up to one half) of his loan notes (the ‘‘First Executive Put

In addition, at any time following the exercise of the First Executive Put Option, the Executive Put Party
shall be entitled to serve notice on Holdco and Finco of their intention to exercise another put option.

his C and D shares held in Holdco; and (2) Finco to purchase, repay or redeem up to a quarter (in the
case of Alan McNair, up to one half) of his loan notes.

repay or redeem up to a quarter of his shares held in Holdco; and (2) Finco to purchase, repay or redeem
up to a quarter of his loan notes (the ‘‘First Senior Manager Put Option’’). In addition, at any time

following such service, the Senior Put Party will require: (1) Holdco to purchase, repay or redeem up to a
quarter of his shares held in Holdco; and (2) Finco to purchase, repay or redeem up to a quarter of his

of the Vue Acquisition.

any replacement debt replacing the Notes Documents or (ii) the payment of any dividend, redemption,

with the Issuer the ‘‘Borrowers’’). The Revolving Credit Facility will be guaranteed by the Guarantors and
the Issuer. The facility agent (the ‘‘Agent’’) under the Revolving Credit Facility will be Lloyds TSB Bank
plc.

**_Ancillary facilities_**

Under the Revolving Credit Facility, a lender may make available an ancillary facility, such as overdrafts,
guarantees, short-term loan facilities, derivatives or foreign exchange facilities subject to the satisfaction
of certain conditions precedent, to a Borrower in place of all or part of its unutilized commitment under
the Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Repayments and prepayments_**

The Revolving Credit Facility will terminate on the date falling six years after the date of the closing of the

part of the available commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by giving three business days’
prior written notice to the Agent. Amounts prepaid or repaid may (subject to the terms of the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement) be re-borrowed.

In addition to any voluntary prepayments, the Revolving Credit Facility requires mandatory prepayment

obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility;

Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement). Each interest period will be one,
three or six months (as selected by the Issuer) or such other period as may be agreed between the Agent

consolidated EBITDA of the guarantors (excluding any guarantor with negative earnings before interest,
tax, depreciation and amortization (calculated on the same basis as consolidated EBITDA)) is required
to exceed 85% of the Restricted Group’s consolidated EBITDA (the ‘‘EBITDA Test’’) and (ii) the
aggregate turnover of the guarantors is required to exceed 85% of the turnover of the Restricted Group
(the ‘‘Turnover Test’’), provided that, (A) if either of these requirements are breached solely by reason of a
newly acquired company becoming a member of the Group, there shall be no breach if (subject to the

the claims of other unsecured and unsubordinated creditors (except where such claims are mandatorily

130

preferred by law); (vii) commercially reasonable steps to preserve and enforce material rights under the
Acquisition Documents (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility); (viii) maintenance of insurances;
(ix) the preservation and maintenance of intellectual property; (x) certain further assurances with respect
to the Collateral; (xi) ensuring occupational pension schemes are funded to the extent required by
applicable law; (xii) access to books, accounts and records, viewing of assets and discussion with
management following an Event of Default; (xiii) undertakings and certain conditions subsequent
relating to the acquisition of CinemaxX, and (xiv) compliance with sanctions and anti-money laundering

_Negative covenants_

The Revolving Credit Facility contains certain negative covenants which include, among others,
restrictions with respect to: (i) substantially changing the general nature of the business of the Group;
(ii) changes of center of main interests; (iii) limitation on activities of certain holding companies;
(iv) restrictions (subject to certain exceptions) on entering into certain hedging transactions;
(v) restrictions on intra-group dealings of assets subject to transaction security and (vi) restrictions on
members of the Group (other than the Issuer) being the issuer or borrower of the Notes and on members
of the Group (other than Midco) being the issuer or borrower of any High Yield Notes (as defined in the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement).

_Financial covenant_

Under the Revolving Credit Facility, we are required to ensure compliance with a minimum Consolidated
EBITDA financial covenant (as determined in accordance with the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement).

The financial covenant requires us to ensure that Consolidated EBITDA as at the end of each relevant
period shall not be less than £70,000,000. The financial covenant shall only apply to the extent that the
aggregate amount of all outstanding loans under the Revolving Credit Facility on the last day of the
applicable relevant period is equal to or greater than £15,000,000. This financial covenant will be tested
quarterly on a rolling 12-month basis.

In the event that the financial covenant is not complied with, such non-compliance may be cured with the
cash proceeds of Additional Shareholder Funding (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement) prior to the end of the period 20 business days following the date on which the compliance
certificate setting out the calculations in respect of the relevant covenant determination is required to be
delivered. There shall be no more than three equity cures over the life of the Revolving Credit Facility and
no equity cures may be made in consecutive quarters. The financial covenant referred to above reflects
the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement as of the date of this offering circular and may be amended or
waived in whole or in part in accordance with the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

**_Events of default_**

The Revolving Credit Facility contains customary events of default (subject in certain cases to agreed
grace periods, thresholds and other qualifications) including, among others, non-payment; a cross
default with respect to indebtedness above £5 million of any member of the Group; misrepresentation;
breach of the financial covenant; breach of other obligations; unlawfulness; repudiation, audit
qualification, failure to comply with the Warner Village intercreditor arrangements, and material adverse
change and events of default that are substantially the same as those applicable to the Notes, the
occurrence of which would allow the lenders to accelerate all or part of the outstanding utilizations
and/or terminate their commitments and/or declare all or part of their utilizations payable on demand
and/or declare that cash cover in respect of letters of credit and ancillary facilities is immediately due and
payable.

**_Governing law_**

The Revolving Credit Facility and any non-contractual obligation arising out of or in connection with it will
be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with English law although the incurrence
covenants and additional events of default, which are included in the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement and replicate those to be contained in the Indenture, will be interpreted in accordance with
New York law (without prejudice to the fact that the Revolving Credit Facility is governed by, and shall be
enforced in accordance with, English law).

**Intercreditor Agreement**

In connection with entering into the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Indenture, we and
certain of our other subsidiaries will enter into the Intercreditor Agreement to govern the relationships
and relative priorities among: (i) the facility agent (the ‘‘RCF Facility Agent’’) on behalf of the lenders
under the Revolving Credit Facility and (after its accession, the facility agent on behalf of the lenders
under any other the Credit Facilities (as defined below); (ii) the Trustee on behalf of the Noteholders of
the Notes; (iii) (following their accession) hedge counterparties under certain hedging agreements;
(iv) the arranger of the Revolving Credit Facility; (vi) the security agent named therein; (v) certain intra
group creditors and debtors; and (vi) certain direct or indirect shareholders of the Issuer (or subsidiaries
thereof which are not members of the Restricted Group or subsidiaries of the Issuer) (‘‘Shareholder
Creditors’’) in respect of certain structural debt that the Issuer has or may incur in the future (including
the shareholder loans provided to the Issuer).

We and each of our subsidiaries that incurs any liability or provides any guarantee, indemnity or other
assurance against loss in respect of liabilities to those creditors regulated under the Intercreditor
Agreement are referred to in this description as ‘‘Debtors’’ (and any documents evidencing such
liabilities, the ‘‘Debt Documents’’).

The Intercreditor Agreement will set out, among other things:

- the relative ranking of certain indebtedness of the Debtors;

- the relative ranking of certain security granted by the Debtors;

- when payments can be made in respect of certain indebtedness of the Debtors;

- when enforcement actions can be taken in respect of that indebtedness;

- the terms pursuant to which that indebtedness will be subordinated upon the occurrence of certain
insolvency events;

- turnover provisions; and

- when collateral and guarantees will be released to permit a sale of the Collateral.

The Intercreditor Agreement will contain provisions relating to future indebtedness that may be incurred
by the Debtors provided that it is not prohibited to be incurred by the terms of the Indenture, the Credit
Facility Documents, the High Yield Documents, any existing Pari Passu Documents (as defined below)
or with the consent of the relevant creditor representatives under each such document, which may rank
_pari passu to the Notes and be secured by the Collateral (the ‘‘Pari Passu Debt,’’ the documents_
evidencing any Pari Passu Debt being the ‘‘Pari Passu Debt Documents’’) subject to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement will also contain provisions relating to future high yield notes, exchange
notes, securities or other debt instruments (including loans, credit and guarantee facilities) (the ‘‘High
Yield Notes’’) that may be incurred by Midco or any holding company of Midco or any subsidiary of that
holding company (not a member of the Restricted Group or a subsidiary of the Issuer) (a ‘‘High Yield
Issuer’’) ranking with the priority set out below under ‘‘—Ranking and priority.’’ The High Yield Notes will
be secured by the Shared Collateral (as defined below) (the ‘‘High Yield Notes’’ and the documents
evidencing any High Yield Notes being the ‘‘High Yield Documents’’).

In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement will contain provisions relating to credit facilities that meet the
requirements of a ‘‘Credit Facility’’ under and as defined in the Indenture and which refinance or replace
the Revolving Credit Facility in full (together with the Revolving Credit Facility, the ‘‘Credit Facilities’’ and
the documents evidencing the Credit Facilities and the Revolving Credit Facility being the ‘‘Credit
Facilities Documents’’ and the lenders under the Credit Facilities and the Revolving Credit Facility being
the ‘‘Credit Facility Lenders’’). For the purposes of this description, any references to the Credit Facilities
or Credit Facility Lenders or Credit Facility Liabilities (as defined below) should be read as including any
such refinancing debt and the debt under the Revolving Credit Facility.

The Creditors of the Pari Passu Debt (the ‘‘Pari Passu Creditors’’) and the holders of the High Yield Notes
(the ‘‘High Yield Noteholders’’ and together with the trustee of such High Yield Notes, the ‘‘High Yield
Creditors’’) will have rights under the Intercreditor Agreement which are summarized below.

132


-----

The following description is a summary of certain provisions that will be contained in the Intercreditor
Agreement. It does not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety nor does it describe provisions
relating to the rights and obligations of holders of other classes of our debt. As such, we urge you to read
the Intercreditor Agreement because it, and not the discussion that follows, defines the rights of the
Noteholders.

**_Ranking and priority_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide, subject to the provisions summarized below regarding
permitted payments, that the right and priority of payment will rank in right and priority in the following
order:

- **first, all present and future Credit Facility Lender Liabilities, the Creditor Representative Liabilities,**
the Super Senior Hedging Liabilities, the Arranger Liabilities, the Notes Liabilities and the Pari Passu
Debt Liabilities, pari passu and without any preference between them;

- **second, all present and future liabilities and obligations of a member of the Restricted Group that is**
a guarantor or provides an indemnity to the High Yield Creditors under the High Yield Documents
(each, a ‘‘High Yield Guarantor’’ and its liabilities being ‘‘High Yield Guarantee Liabilities’’) and all
present and future liabilities owed by the Issuer to Midco under or in connection with a High Yield
Proceeds Loan (‘‘Holdco Liabilities’’), pari passu and without any preference between them;

- **third, certain intra group obligations to the intra group lenders (‘‘Intra Group Liabilities’’), pari passu**
and without any preference between them; and

- **fourth, shareholder liabilities (which consists of liabilities owed by a Debtor to any Shareholder**
Creditor other than the Holdco Liabilities (the ‘‘Shareholder Liabilities’’)), pari passu and without any
preference between them.

The Credit Facility Lenders, the Hedge Counterparties, the Noteholders, the High Yield Creditors and the
Pari Passu Creditors will benefit from a common guarantee and (except for the High Yield Creditors)
collateral package and no such secured creditor may take the benefit of any guarantee or collateral
unless such guarantee or collateral is also offered for the benefit of the other secured creditors from the
Restricted Group. The High Yield Creditors will benefit from a collateral package comprising security
over any debt instruments used to on loan the proceeds of the High Yield Notes from the relevant High
Yield Issuer to the Issuer (where Midco is the High Yield Issuer) or to Midco and then the Issuer (where
Midco is not the High Yield Issuer) (a ‘‘High Yield Proceeds Loan’’) and security over the shares of the
Issuer which is shared with the other secured creditors (the ‘‘Shared Collateral’’). The Collateral shall
rank and secure the liabilities as follows:

- **first, the liabilities owed to the Credit Facility Lenders (the ‘‘Credit Facility Lender Liabilities’’), the**
liabilities owed to the creditor representatives (the ‘‘Creditor Representative Liabilities’’), the
liabilities owed to the arrangers (the ‘‘Arranger Liabilities’’), the liabilities owed to the Noteholders
(the ‘‘Notes Liabilities’’), the liabilities owed to the Pari Passu Creditors (the ‘‘Pari Passu Debt
Liabilities’’) and the liabilities owed to the hedge counterparties (the ‘‘Hedge Counterparties’’) under
or in connection with any hedging documents (the ‘‘Hedging Documents’’) which document the
Super Senior Hedging Liabilities and the Non Super Senior Hedging Liabilities (the ‘‘Hedging
Liabilities’’), pari passu and without any preference between them; and

- **second (and in respect of the Shared Collateral only), the liabilities owed by the debtors under the**
High Yield Notes (the ‘‘High Yield Liabilities’’),

but, in each case, only to the extent that such Collateral is expressed to secure those liabilities and
irrespective of (i) the order of execution, creation, registration, notice enforcement or otherwise, (ii) the
date on which the liability arose, (iii) any fluctuation in the amount, or intermediate discharge in whole or
part, of any liability.

In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the guarantees and Collateral will be released in
certain circumstances described further below in ‘‘—Release of collateral and guarantees—
_non-distressed disposals’’ and ‘‘—Release of collateral and guarantees—distressed disposals.’’_

Indebtedness under the Credit Facilities and Super Senior Hedging Liabilities will be secured by first
priority security interests in the Collateral and receive priority to the proceeds from the Collateral in the
event of any enforcement.

133


-----

Interest rate hedging liabilities in respect of the Credit Facility Lender Liabilities, the Notes Liabilities, the
Pari Passu Debt, the High Yield Liabilities and financial indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the
Credit Facility Documents, the Indenture, the Pari Passu Debt Documents and the High Yield Notes
Documents and currency hedging liabilities, in respect of the Credit Facility Lender Liabilities, the Notes
Liabilities, the Pari Passu Debt, and the High Yield Liabilities, and financial indebtedness permitted to be
incurred under the Credit Facility Documents, the Indenture, the Pari Passu Debt Documents, the High
Yield Notes Documents together with interest rate and currency hedging liabilities in respect of ordinary
course and commercial activities and not for speculative purposes and excluding commodity hedging
(up to an aggregate notional amount at any time of £10 million), may be secured and rank pari passu
with the Credit Facilities and receive priority to the proceeds from the Collateral in the event of any
enforcement (the ‘‘Super Senior Hedging Liabilities’’). All other interest rate and currency hedging
liabilities in respect of ordinary course and commercial activities will rank _pari passu with the Notes_
Liabilities in respect of enforcement proceeds (the ‘‘Non Super Senior Hedging Liabilities’’).

**_Permitted payments_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will permit payments to be made by the Debtors under the Credit Facility
Documents, the Notes Documents and the Pari Passu Debt Documents, (provided such payments are
permitted and not prohibited under such documents). There are also restrictions on payments to Hedge
Counterparties except certain specified permitted payments as described below.

The Debtors may make payments of the Notes Liabilities at any other time in accordance with the terms
of the Notes Documents subject to (a) (prior to the final maturity date under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement), any restrictions on note purchases contained in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement
and (b) (prior to the discharge date under any other Credit Facility Document) any provisions in any
other outstanding Credit Facility Documents dealing with note purchases.

The Intercreditor Agreement will also permit payments in respect of the High Yield Guarantee Liabilities
and to Shareholder Creditors in respect of Holdco Liabilities prior to the later of the date on which all the
Credit Facility Liabilities, the Creditor Representative Liabilities owed to the agent under the Credit
Facility and the Super Senior Hedging Liabilities have been fully and finally discharged (the ‘‘Super
Senior Discharge Date’’), the date on which the Notes Liabilities and the Non Super Senior Hedging
Liabilities will have been fully and finally discharged (the ‘‘Senior Secured Notes Discharge Date’’) and
the date on which the Pari Passu Debt Liabilities have been fully and finally discharged (the ‘‘Pari Passu
Discharge Date’’ and the later of the Senior Secured Notes Discharge Date and the Pari Passu Discharge
Date being (the ‘‘Senior Secured Discharge Date’’) subject to:

(a) (i) if the payment is of any principal amount (including capitalised interest) of the liabilities under
the High Yield Documents (the ‘‘High Yield Liabilities’’) which is not prohibited from being paid
by the Credit Facility Documents, the Notes Documents and any Pari Passu Debt Document or
is a payment of any amount which is not an amount of principal or capitalized interest, (ii) no
notice of an event of default under the Credit Facility Documents, the Indenture or the Pari
Passu Debt Documents (a ‘‘High Yield Stop Notice’’) has been delivered by the relevant
creditor representative of such liabilities (in which case, no such payments will be made until
the earlier of (a) the date falling 179 days after the delivery of that High Yield Stop Notice,
(b) there is a failure to pay principal on the original final stated scheduled maturity date of the
High Yield Notes, (c) if a High Yield Standstill Period is in effect, the date on which that High
Yield Standstill period expires, (d) the date on which the relevant event of default ceases to be
outstanding (provided no event of default has occurred and is continuing under any of the other
relevant documents), (e) the date on which the relevant High Yield Stop Notice is cancelled,
(f) the Senior Secured Discharge Date and (g) the date on which the High Yield Creditors are
permitted to take enforcement action) and (iii) no payment default under any Credit Facility
Documents, the Notes Documents and the Pari Passu Debt Documents (above any agreed
threshold) has occurred and is continuing;

(b) the Majority Super Senior Creditors and the creditor representatives in respect of the
Noteholders and the Pari Passu Creditors give prior consent to that payment being made;

(c) the payment is of amounts owing to the trustee for the High Yield Notes (the ‘‘High Yield Notes
Trustee’’);

134


-----

(d) the payment is of administrative and maintenance costs, fees, expenses and taxes of the High
Yield Issuer (including in relation to any reporting or listing requirements) under the High Yield
Notes, as permitted under the terms of the Credit Facility Documents;

(e) the payment is of costs, consent fees, commissions, underwriter or lead manager fees
(including OID), taxes, premiums and any expenses incurred in respect of (or reasonably
incidental to) any financing or refinancing of the High Yield Notes in compliance with the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Credit Facility Documents, the Indenture and the Pari Passu Debt
Documents; or

(f) if the payment is the principal amount of High Yield Liabilities and is paid on or after the final
originally scheduled maturity date of such High Yield Liabilities (provided that such maturity
date is a date not earlier than 1 year after the originally scheduled maturity date of the Notes and
the Revolving Credit Facility) at the time of issuance of such High Yield Notes.

Payments to intra group lenders owed any Intra Group Liabilities (such payments, ‘‘Intra Group Liabilities
Payments’’) are permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement if at the time of payment no acceleration event
has occurred. The Intercreditor Agreement permits Intra Group Liabilities Payments if an acceleration
event has occurred if, among other things: (i) prior to the Super Senior Discharge Date, permitted or not
prohibited by the RCF Facility Agreement, (ii) prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date, permitted or
not prohibited by the Indenture pursuant to which any Notes remain outstanding, (iii) prior to the Pari
Passu Discharge Date, permitted or not prohibited by the Pari Passu Debt Documents, (iv) prior to the
High Yield Discharge Date, permitted or not prohibited by the High Yield Documents pursuant to which
any High Yield Notes remain outstanding, (v) any managing director of any of the Debtor incorporated in
Germany is required by mandatory law to make or to demand payment of the relevant Intra Group
Liabilities in order to avoid personal and/or criminal liability, (vi) that payment is made to facilitate
payment of the Super Senior Liabilities, the Notes Liabilities, the Pari Passu Debt Liabilities and/or the
Non Super Senior Hedging Liabilities or (vii) that payment is made to facilitate payment of the High Yield
Liabilities that are permitted to be paid under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

Payments may be made in respect of Shareholder Liabilities and Holdco Liabilities if (i) prior to the Super
Senior Discharge Date, permitted or not prohibited by the RCF Facility Agreement, (ii) prior to the Senior
Secured Discharge Date, permitted or not prohibited by the Indenture pursuant to which any Notes
remain outstanding, (iii) prior to the Pari Passu Discharge Date, permitted or not prohibited by the Pari
Passu Debt Documents, (iv) prior to the High Yield Discharge Date, permitted or not prohibited by the
High Yield Documents pursuant to which any High Yield Notes remain outstanding or (v) the payment is
to be made by the Issuer to the Midco and is equal to and the amount is used for a payment in respect of
any High Yield Liabilities then due and payable by the relevant High Yield Issuer (or, in the case of a
payment in respect of scheduled interest, such payment will become due and payable within three
Business Days) and which is a permitted high yield payment.

Subject to the certain conditions described below, the Debtors may make payments to any Hedge
Counterparty in respect of the Hedging Liabilities then due to that Hedge Counterparty under any
Hedging Document in accordance with the terms of that Hedging Document: (i) if the payment is a
scheduled payment arising under the relevant Hedging Document; (ii) to the extent that the relevant
Debtor’s obligation to make the payment arises as a result of the operation of certain provisions relating
to withholding tax, payments in the contractual currency, judgments, expenses and default interest;
(iii) to the extent that the relevant Debtor’s obligation to make the payment arises from a non-credit
related close-out; (iv) to the extent that the relevant Debtor’s obligation to make the payment arises as a
result of the operation of a credit related close-out under the Hedging Document which arises as a result
of an event relating to a Debtor and where no event of default under any Credit Facilities Document,
Notes Document or Pari Passu Debt Document is continuing at the time of that payment; (v) where the
relevant payment relates to a close-out or termination arising as a result of a bankruptcy event of default
or force majeure termination event with respect to the relevant Hedge Counterparty and where no event
of default under any Credit Facilities Document, Notes Document, Pari Passu Debt Document or High
Yield Documents is continuing at the time of, or would result from, that payment or (vi) with the consent
of the Majority Super Senior Creditors (excluding the Hedge Counterparties which are owed Super
Senior Hedging Liabilities) and the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (excluding Hedge Counterparties
which are owed Non-Super Senior Hedging Liabilities) of each tranche.

An acceleration event includes the relevant creditor representative exercising any or all of its rights under
the acceleration provisions of the Credit Facilities Documents, or any other equivalent acceleration

135


-----

provisions under any of the Notes Documents, the Pari Passu Debt Documents or the High Yield
Documents.

**_Limitations on enforcement by Super Senior Creditors and Senior Secured Creditors_**

For the purposes of enforcement:

- the Credit Facility Lenders, the Hedge Counterparties (to the extent they are owed Super Senior
Hedging Liabilities) and their creditor representatives are referred to as the ‘‘Super Senior
Creditors’’ and the liabilities being owed to the Credit Facility Lenders, the Creditor Representative
of the Credit Facilities and the Hedge Counterparties, which are owed Super Senior Hedging
Liabilities (the ‘‘Super Senior Liabilities’’); and

- the Noteholders, the Pari Passu Creditors, Non-Super Senior Hedging Liabilities and their creditor
representatives are referred to as the ‘‘Senior Secured Creditors.’’

The security agent may refrain from enforcing the Collateral or taking any other enforcement action
unless instructed by the Instructing Group (as defined below). If any of the Super Senior Creditors or the
Senior Secured Creditors wish to enforce the Collateral, either (a) the majority Super Senior Creditors
(being 66[2]⁄3% by value of the Super Senior Creditors) (the ‘‘Majority Super Senior Creditors’’) or (b) the
majority Senior Secured Creditors (being more than 50% in value of the Senior Secured Creditors
entitled to vote as described in the Intercreditor Agreement) (the ‘‘Majority Senior Secured Creditors’’)
(in each case acting through their respective creditor representative) (the ‘‘Instructing Group’’) must give
at least five business days’ (or such shorter period as each creditor representative may agree) notice of
the proposed enforcement instructions to the creditor representatives for the other creditor classes and
the security agent.

If the security agent receives conflicting instructions, then, to the extent instructions from the Majority
Senior Secured Creditors have been given, the security agent will comply with such instructions,
provided that, if the Super Senior Liabilities have not been fully and finally discharged within six months
of the Time Period Start Date (as defined below) or if no enforcement has occurred within three months
of the Time Period Start Date (as defined below), then the instructions of the Majority Super Senior
Creditors will prevail.

To the extent that the enforcement instructions conflict (and a failure by a creditor representative for the
Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors to give any instruction shall be
deemed a conflicting enforcement instruction for the purposes of triggering a consultation period and for
determining the Instructing Group), the giving of this notice triggers a 30-day consultation period (or
such shorter period as the relevant creditor representatives shall agree) (the end of such period being
the ‘‘Time Period Start Date’’) during which time the creditor representatives for each of the creditor
classes must discuss the proposals in good faith with a view to co-coordinating the proposed
enforcement instructions.

A creditor representative is not obliged to consult as described above (or shall only be obliged to consult
for a shorter period in the case of the second dot point below as the Instructing Group may determine) if:

- the Collateral has become enforceable as a result of a insolvency event in relation to a Debtor; or

- that creditor representative (acting on the instructions of the relevant creditor group) determines in
good faith and notifies the other creditor representatives and the security agent that to do so and
thereby delay enforcement of the Collateral could reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on (A) the security agent’s ability to enforce any of the Collateral or (B) the realization
proceeds of any enforcement of the Collateral in any material respect;

- a period of not less than three months has elapsed since the date the proposed enforcement
instructions were given and no enforcement is being effected by the security agent or the Super
Senior Liabilities have not been fully and finally discharged within six months from the date the
proposed enforcement instructions were given; or

- the creditor representatives are in agreement that no initial consultation period shall be required.

If consultation has taken place for at least 30 days as described above (or such shorter period as may
have been agreed between the relevant creditor representatives) (or was not required to occur as
described above), there shall be no further obligation to consult and the security agent may act in
accordance with the instructions as to enforcement of the Instructing Group (as described above) and

136


-----

the Instructing Group may issue instructions as to enforcement to the security agent at any time
thereafter.

If the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (in each case acting
reasonably) consider that the security agent is enforcing the Collateral in a manner which is not
consistent with the Security Enforcement Principles, subject to the exceptions to the requirement for a
consultation period described above, the creditor representative(s) for the Super Senior Creditors or the
Senior Secured Creditors (as appropriate) shall give notice to the creditor representative(s) for the other
Super Senior Creditors and the Senior Secured Creditors (as appropriate) after which the creditor
representative(s) for the other Super Senior Creditors and the Senior Secured Creditors (as appropriate)
shall consult with the security agent for a period of 15 days (or such lesser period as the relevant creditor
representatives may agree) with a view to agreeing the manner of enforcement provided that such
creditor representatives shall not be obliged to consult more than once in relation to each enforcement
action.

Any enforcement instructions given must comply with certain collateral enforcement principles (the
‘‘Security Enforcement Principles’’) and the collateral enforcement objective, including:

- to achieve the collateral enforcement objective, namely to maximize, to the extent consistent with a
prompt and expeditious realization of value from enforcement of the Collateral, the recovery by all of
the Super Senior Creditors and the Senior Secured Creditors;

- either all enforcement proceeds will be received in cash by the security agent or, in the case of
enforcement by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, sufficient enforcement proceeds will be
received in cash by the security agent to ensure that after distribution in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Super Senior Liabilities will be repaid in full (unless the Majority Super
Senior Creditors agree);

- to the extent that the enforcement is over Collateral with an aggregate book value exceeding
£1,000,000, or the enforcement is over Collateral over some or all of the shares in a member of the
Restricted Group, the security agent shall, if requested by the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the
Majority Senior Secured Creditors, and at the expense of the Company (unless it is incompatible
with enforcement proceedings in a relevant jurisdiction) appoint an internationally recognized
investment bank or any one of a ‘‘big four’’ accounting firm, BDO or Grant Thornton or, if not
practicable, from another reputable independent third party professional firm that is regularly
engaged in providing valuations of the relevant type of assets, to opine that the consideration
received for any disposal is fair from a financial point of view taking into account all relevant
circumstances (the ‘‘Financial Advisor’s Opinion’’);

- the security agent will be under no obligation to appoint a financial advisor or to seek the advice of a
financial advisor, unless expressly required to do so by any provision of the Intercreditor Agreement;

- the Financial Advisor’s Opinion will be conclusive evidence that the Collateral Enforcement
Principles have been met; and

- if any enforcement action of collateral is conducted by way of public or private auction or other
competitive sale process, which is conducted with the advice of an independent investment bank or
intentionally recognized firm of accountants or a reputable independent third party professional firm
which is regularly engaged in such sale processes (a ‘‘Competitive Sales Process’’), no Financial
Advisor needs to be appointed in respect of such enforcement action.

**_Limitations on enforcement by High Yield Creditors_**

Until the Senior Secured Discharge Date, except with the prior consent of or as required by the
Instructing Group, no High Yield Creditor shall take or require the taking of any enforcement action in
relation to the High Yield Guarantee Liabilities or direct the security agent or otherwise require the
enforcement of any of the Shared Collateral, except if:

- a default under any High Yield Documents is continuing and a period (the ‘‘High Yield Standstill
Period’’) of ending the earlier of (a) 179 days from the date of service of notice in writing of such
default from the relevant High Yield Notes Trustee to each of the relevant creditor representatives
with respect to the Super Senior Creditors and Senior Secured Creditors, (b) the date the relevant
High Yield Guarantor is subject to a insolvency event against whom enforcement action is taken,
(c) the date on which any other standstill period expires in respect of such default, and at the end of

137


-----

such period such default is continuing, (d) the date on which the creditor representative for the
Credit Facility Lenders, the Noteholders and the Pari Passu Creditors consent to enforcement in
respect of such default, (e) the date the Super Senior Creditors or the Senior Secured Creditors take
any enforcement action in respect of a High Yield Guarantor provided that a High Yield Creditor may
only take the same enforcement action in relation to that High Yield Guarantor as the enforcement
action taken by the Super Senior Creditors and/or the Senior Secured Creditors against that
Guarantor (and not against any other member of the Restricted Group) and that enforcement action
for these purposes shall not include action solely taken to preserve or protect any Collateral as
opposed to release it, and (f) a failure to pay the principal amount outstanding at the final stated
maturity of the High Yield Notes; and

- the creditor representatives for the Credit Facility Lenders, the Noteholders and the Pari Passu
Creditors have received notice of such default,

provided that, if the Security Agent has notified the High Yield Notes Trustee (or any creditor
representative in respect of High Yield Creditors) that it is enforcing security over the shares of a High
Yield Guarantor, no High Yield Creditor may take enforcement action in relation to such High Yield
Guarantor while the security agent is taking steps to enforce that security on the instructions of an
Instructing Group where such action might be reasonably likely to adversely affect such enforcement or
the amount of proceeds to be derived therefrom.

**_Limitation on Enforcement of Intra Group Liabilities and Shareholder Liabilities_**

Creditors in respect of the Intra Group Liabilities or Shareholder Liabilities will not be permitted to take
any enforcement action in respect of such liabilities prior to the Final Discharge Date (other than certain
specific enforcement action as set out in the Intercreditor Agreement) save that, after the occurrence of
an insolvency event in relation to any member of the Restricted Group, each intra group lender or
shareholder creditor (as the case may be) may (unless otherwise directed by the security agent or
unless the security agent has taken, or has given notice that it intends to take, action on behalf of that
intra group lender or shareholder creditor (as the case may be) in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement) and shall, if so directed by the security agent, exercise any right it may otherwise have
against that member of the Restricted Group to:

(a) accelerate any of that member of the Restricted Group’s Intra Group Liabilities or Shareholder
Liabilities (as the case may be) or declare them prematurely due and payable or payable on
demand;

(b) make a demand under any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss given by that
member of the Restricted Group in respect of any Intra Group Liabilities or Shareholder
Liabilities (as the case may be);

(c) exercise any right of set-off or take or receive any payment in respect of any Intra Group
Liabilities or Shareholder Liabilities (as the case may be) of that member of the Restricted
Group; or

(d) file claims, or claim and prove in the liquidation of that member of the Restricted Group for the
Intra Group Liabilities or Shareholder Liabilities (as the case may be) owing to it.

No Intra-Group Lender incorporated in Germany shall be prevented from exercising any of the rights
referred to in this section if and to the extent the exercise of such rights is required by mandatory law to
avoid any personal liability of any managing director of that Intra-Group Lender.

**_Turnover_**

Subject to certain exclusions, if any Super Senior Creditor, Noteholder, Non-Super Senior Hedge
Counterparty, Pari Passu Creditor or High Yield Creditor (or any of their respective creditor
representatives) receives or recovers the proceeds of any enforcement of any Collateral except in
accordance with ‘‘—Application of proceeds’’ below, that person must:

and the Pari Passu Creditors in connection with the Credit Facility Lender Liabilities under the Credit
Facility Documents, the Hedging Liabilities under the Hedging Documents, the Notes Liabilities under
the Indenture and the Pari Passu Debt Liabilities under the Pari Passu Debt Documents.

**_Release of collateral and guarantees—non-distressed disposals_**

In circumstances where a disposal is not a distressed disposal (including a solvent liquidation or
reorganization of any Debtor or member of the Group that results in no person or a different person
owning the relevant assets, and such action is otherwise permitted by the Credit Facility Documents, the
Notes Documents, the Pari Passu Debt Documents or the High Yield Documents), the Intercreditor
Agreement will provide for an automatic release of the security (where effective) and otherwise that the
security agent named therein is authorized and instructed:

(a) to release the Collateral or any other claim over the relevant asset; and

(b) if the relevant asset consists of shares in the capital of a member of the Group, to release the
Collateral or any other claim over the assets of that Group Member and (where the disposal is to
a person which is not a member of the Restricted Group) the assets of any of their subsidiaries,

provided that (i) in the case of a disposal to another member of the Restricted Group, to the extent
replacement Collateral is required from the transferee under the relevant Debt Documents, any required
replacement collateral is granted by the transferee before or at the same time as the release and, (ii) if

140


-----

required by the terms of the relevant Debt Documents, any proceeds from the disposal are applied in
mandatory prepayment of the relevant debt.

**_Release of collateral and guarantees—distressed disposals_**

In circumstances where a distressed disposal is being effected, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide
that the security agent is authorized and instructed:

(a) to release the Collateral or any other claim over the relevant asset;

(b) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor, to release (i) that
Debtor and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing liabilities (other
than those liabilities owed by the Issuer to the Super Senior Creditors, Noteholders, Pari Passu
Creditors and Hedge Counterparties) as described in the Intercreditor Agreement and certain
guaranteeing liabilities and other liabilities as described in the Intercreditor Agreement, (ii) any
Collateral granted over that Debtor’s assets and the assets of any of its subsidiaries and (iii) any
other claim of a Debtor or intra group lender over that Debtor’s assets or over the assets of any
subsidiary of that Debtor;

(c) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of a
Debtor, to release (i) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all
or any part of its borrowing liabilities (other than those liabilities owed by the Issuer to the Super
Senior Creditors, Noteholders, Pari Passu Creditors and Hedge Counterparties) as described
in the Intercreditor Agreement, certain guaranteeing liabilities as described in the Intercreditor
Agreement and certain other liabilities as described in the Intercreditor Agreement, (ii) any
Collateral granted over the assets of any subsidiary of that holding company and (iii) any other
claim of a Debtor or intra group lender over that Debtor’s assets or over the assets of any
subsidiary of that holding company;

(d) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or any holding
company of a Debtor, to dispose of all or any part of that Debtor’s or the holding company of
that Debtor’s borrowing liabilities (other than those liabilities owed by the Issuer to the Super
Senior Creditors, Noteholders, Pari Passu Creditors and Hedge Counterparties), certain
guaranteeing liabilities and certain other liabilities; and

(e) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or any holding
company of a Debtor, to transfer intra group liabilities and debtor liabilities owed by that Debtor
or holding company of a Debtor to another Debtor.

Any net proceeds of the disposal must be applied in accordance with the enforcement proceeds
waterfall described above under ‘‘—Application of proceeds.’’

Prior to the High Yield Discharge Date, a distressed disposal is being effected such that the High Yield
Guarantees and Shared Collateral will be released, it being a condition of this release that:

(a) either all or substantially all of the consideration for the relevant sale or disposal is cash or the
disposal is made pursuant to any process or proceedings approved or supervised by or on
behalf of any court of law where there is a determination of value by or on behalf of the court;

(b) either the sale or disposal is made pursuant to (i) a Competitive Process, (ii) any process or
proceedings approved or supervised by or on behalf of any court of law where there is a
determination of value by or on behalf of the court or (iii) where the security agent has obtained
a Financial Advisor’s Opinion confirming that the sale, disposal or transfer price is fair from a
financial point of view after taking into account all relevant circumstances, including the method
of enforcement; and

(c) the claims of each of the Super Senior Creditors, Noteholders, Pari Passu Creditors, Hedge
Counterparties and High Yield Noteholders against the relevant entities or assets are
irrevocably and unconditionally released or sold or disposed of concurrently with such sale
(and are not assumed by the relevant purchaser or by any affiliate of such purchaser) and all
Collateral over such relevant entities or assets are released provided that in the event of a sale
or disposal of any such claim (instead of a release or discharge) the relevant creditor
representative determines acting reasonably and in good faith, that the Super Senior Creditors,
Noteholders, Pari Passu Creditors and Hedge Counterparties will recover more than if such

141


-----

claim was released or discharged and the representative in respect of the relevant creditor
group serves a notice on the security agent notifying the security agent of the same, in which
case the security agent shall be entitled immediately to sell and transfer such claim to such
purchaser (or to an affiliate of such purchaser).

The proceeds from the relevant sale or disposal are to be applied accordance with the enforcement
proceeds waterfall described above under ‘‘—Application of proceeds.’’

**_Amendment_**

Except for (i) amendments of a minor, technical or administrative nature which may be effected by the
security agent and the Company, (ii) amendments made by the relevant creditor representatives
(without any further instructions from the relevant creditor groups), the Company and the security agent
to cure defects, or typographical errors, or to resolve ambiguities or reflect changes in each case of a
minor or technical nature or (iii) amendments which only affects one class of the relevant creditors which
could not reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the interests of the other classes (in
which case only written agreement from that class will be required), the Intercreditor Agreement may be
amended with the consent of the Majority Super Senior Creditors, the required percentage of the
Noteholders (as set out in the Indenture), the required percentage of the High Yield Noteholders (as set
out in the relevant High Yield Indenture) and the required percentage of Pari Passu Creditors (as set out
in the relevant Pari Passu Debt documentation), the Issuer and the security agent unless it relates to
certain specified matters such as ranking, priority, subordination, turnover, enforcement, disposal
proceeds, amendments or the payment waterfall. Such amendments require consent from all of the
Credit Facility Lenders, the Trustee (acting in accordance with the Indenture), the High Yield Notes
Trustee (acting in accordance with the relevant High Yield Notes Indenture) or other representative or
creditor of the additional tranche of high yield debt (as applicable), the Pari Passu Debt representative
(acting in accordance with the relevant Pari Passu Debt Documents), each Hedge Counterparty (to the
extent that the amendment or waiver would adversely affect the Hedge Counterparties), the Company
and the security agent.

No amendment or waiver of the Intercreditor Agreement may impose new or additional obligations on or
withdraw or reduce the rights of any party (other than, in the case of the Credit Facility Lenders, the
Noteholders, the Pari Passu Creditors and the Hedge Counterparties) in a way which affects creditors of
that party’s class generally or, in the case of the Debtors or third party creditor, to the extent consented to
by the Company) to the Intercreditor Agreement without the prior consent of that party (or, in the case of
the Noteholders, the Pari Passu Creditors and the High Yield Creditors in respect of an issue of debt
securities, the relevant creditor representative).

To the extent the Debtors wish to enter into Pari Passu Debt or other additional or replacement
indebtedness (‘‘Additional Indebtedness’’) which is permitted to share in the Collateral pursuant to the
Credit Facilities Documents, the Notes, other Pari Passu Debt Documents and the High Yield
Documents, then the parties to the Intercreditor Agreement may be required to enter into documentation
to implement this (including without limitation a replacement intercreditor agreement on substantially the
same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement).

**Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement**

As referred to above, in connection with our acquisition of the Warner Village U.K. Cinema Circuit in
2003, we entered into a deed of undertaking and indemnity (the ‘‘Deed’’) in favor of Time Warner and
Village. The Deed was entered into to offer protection in the form of indemnities to Time Warner and
Village in respect of liabilities which they retained pursuant to leases of certain properties that we
acquired but for which Time Warner and Village continue to be contingently liable (either as guarantor or
original tenant) by virtue of English law. Under the terms of the Deed, Time Warner and Village are
entitled to require second ranking security (the ‘‘Time Warner Security’’) and the documents evidencing
the Time Warner Security (the ‘‘Warner Village Security Documents’’) subordinated to any security that a
lender receives in connection with any of our financing arrangements. Time Warner and Village have
taken second ranking charges over some of our property assets but they have not requested any
additional security since 2007.

In connection with the Deed, we will, on or prior to the Closing Date, enter into the Warner Village
Intercreditor Agreement with, among others, Time Warner, Village and Village Roadshow UK Holdings
Pty Limited (the ‘‘Subordinated Creditors’’) to govern the relationship and relative priorities among (i) all

142


-----

present and future Credit Facility Lender Liabilities, the Creditor Representative Liabilities, the Arranger
Liabilities, the Notes Liabilities, the Pari Passu Debt Liabilities and the Hedging Liabilities (each as
defined above) (the ‘‘Senior Creditors’’) and (ii) the Subordinated Creditors in respect of the Permitted
WV Security (as defined in the Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement) and the present and future sums,
liabilities and obligations owing or incurred to the Subordinated Creditors under or in connection with
the Time Warner Security (the ‘‘Warner Village Subordinated Debt’’) and regulate the rights and
obligations of the parties under the Debt Documents and Warner Village Security Documents, which
shall in all respects take effect and be subject to the provisions of the Warner Village Intercreditor
Agreement.

**_Limitations on enforcement_**

The Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, until the Senior Discharge Date (as defined
in the Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement), unless the Creditor Representatives (as defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement) and the Security Agent have previously agreed in writing, no Subordinated
Creditor will:

- exercise any power of attorney in any Warner Village Security Document or exercise any other rights
under the Warner Village Security Documents the effect of which is the enforcement of any security
constituted by the Warner Village Security Documents;

- crystallize, or purport to crystallize, any floating charge in any Warner Village Security Document;

- enforce, or purport to enforce, any Security conferred by the Warner Village Security Documents or
appoint or require the appointment of an insolvency representative to any member of the Group or
over the assets of any member of the Group.

**Undertakings of Obligors**

Until the Senior Discharge Date (unless the creditor representatives have previously agreed otherwise in
writing), no Obligor may, notwithstanding any provision of the Warner Village Security Documents:

- create or permit to subsist any security over any of its assets as security for any of the Warner Village
Subordinated Debt except for the Permitted WV Security; or

- take or omit to take any action whereby the subordinations contemplated by the Warner Village
Intercreditor Agreement may be impaired, terminated or adversely affected.

**Undertakings of the Subordinated Creditors**

Until the Senior Discharge Date (unless the creditor representatives have otherwise agreed in writing),
no Subordinated Creditor shall take, accept or receive the benefit of, or permit to subsist in favour of any
of them, any security upon any assets of the Issuer or its subsidiaries (the ‘‘Group’’) or any guarantee
from any member of the Group, whether directly or indirectly, for or in respect of the Warner Village
Subordinated Debt except for the Permitted WV Security and except as expressly provided for in the
Deed and the sale and purchase agreement dated 12 May 2003 between amongst others, Time Warner,
Village, Vue Entertainment Holdings Limited (the ‘‘WV Acquisition Agreement’’), in each case, as in force
on the date of the Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Ranking and priority_**

The Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the right and priority of payment will rank in
the following order:

- first, all present and future Credit Facility Lender Liabilities, the Creditor Representative Liabilities,
the Arranger Liabilities, the Notes Liabilities, the Pari Passu Debt Liabilities and the Hedging
Liabilities (each as defined above) (the ‘‘Senior Debt’’); and

- second, the Warner Village Subordinated Debt.

The Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement will also provide that the collateral package granted in
respect of the Debt Documents will rank in all respects prior to all existing security and future security
conferred by the Warner Village Security Documents and will secure all of the Debt Documents in priority
to the Warner Village Subordinated Debt.

143


-----

**Proceeds of Enforcement of Security**

Subject to the rights of any prior or preferential encumbrancers or the Senior Creditors and save as
provided by law, the proceeds of enforcement of the security conferred by the security documents
securing the liabilities of the Senior Creditors (the ‘‘Senior Security Documents’’) and all other amounts
paid to any creditor representative or, as the case may be, the Security Agent under the Warner Village
Intercreditor Agreement shall be applied in the following order:

- first, in payment to the Senior Creditors and Arrangers in accordance with the provisions as set out
in the Intercreditor Agreement; and

- second, in payment of the surplus (if any) to such persons who may be entitled to them,

and pending such application shall be held on trust by the Security Agent for the beneficiaries
entitled thereto.

**Amendments to the Warner Village Security Documents**

Until the Senior Discharge Date, unless the creditor representatives have agreed to the variation in
writing, no Obligor or Subordinated Creditor will vary the terms of any Warner Village Security
Document. However, this shall not prevent the making or variation to the terms of any Warner Village
Security Document:

- in a manner and to the extent such that the interests of any of the Senior Creditors or the ranking
and/or subordination arrangements provided for in the Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement are
not adversely affected (as to which a certificate of each creditor representative acting in good faith
will be conclusive); or

- which is to reflect a similar variation to any Credit Facility Document, Notes Document, hedging
agreement or Pari Passu Debt Document (the ‘‘Senior Documents’’) which has been made or given
by the relevant creditor representative; and

- at least five business days prior to any such proposed variation, the Subordinated Creditor shall
deliver to the Security Agent copies of the documentation which it is proposed will effect such
variation.

**Release of Security**

(1) Without prejudice to paragraphs (2) and (3) below and subject to the indemnity obligations in the
Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement and any restrictions on release in the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Security Agent may at its sole discretion and without reference to any other Senior
Creditor or Subordinated Creditor take such action as it deems necessary or advisable to release
any assets from the Security constituted by the Senior Security Documents and the Warner Village
Security Documents to the extent that their disposal or release is:

(i) permitted (or not prohibited) or required by the original form of any Senior Document (other
than the Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement); or

(ii) otherwise permitted or required by the terms of the Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement
including pursuant to any instructions given to it in accordance with the paragraph relating to
instructions below.

(2) Subject to the indemnity obligations in the Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement and any

a subsidiary of the Issuer, the security provided over those shares (and over any assets of that
Obligor (or member of the Group) (and over any assets of any subsidiary of that Obligor (or member
of the Group) being disposed of at the same time) under the Senior Security Documents, the Warner
Village Security Documents and any related guarantee and other liabilities under any Senior
Document or Warner Village Security Documents (including the Deed) to which the relevant
companies being disposed of are subject, will be released by the Security Agent.

(3) Subject to the indemnity obligations in the Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement and any
restrictions on release in the Intercreditor Agreement, if any of the circumstances specified below

144


-----

apply in relation to any asset over which a security has been created under any Senior Security
Document and/or Warner Village Security Document those assets will be released from such
security and any related guarantee (including the Deed). The Security Agent and the Subordinated
Creditors must execute the relevant release documents at the expense of the relevant Obligor
promptly upon (and only upon) the Security Agent being satisfied that the release is permitted under
this paragraph and is in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement. The circumstances in which
this paragraph applies are:

(i) where a disposal is to be made to a person or persons outside (and which will remain outside)
the Group of any assets owned by any Obligor where:

    - prior to the Senior Discharge Date, the disposal is in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement or the Security Agent has received instructions from the relevant Senior
Creditors (or a creditor representative on behalf of the relevant Senior Creditors) that

relevant security over such asset; or

    - the disposal is permitted or not expressly prohibited by the terms of the relevant Senior
Document; or

any security created by the Security Documents has become enforceable; or

    - such disposal is being effected by enforcement of a Security Document; or

(ii) where leasehold property is charged under a floating charge contained in any of the Senior
Security Documents or Warner Village Security Documents in circumstances where such
floating charge breaches the provisions of such lease and prior to the Senior Discharge Date,
the Senior Creditors agree to such release or the Security Agent has received instructions from
the relevant Senior Creditors (or the relevant Creditor Representative) that comply with the
paragraph relating to instructions below, instructing it to release the relevant security over such
lease.

(4) In connection with any release contemplated in paragraphs (1), (2) or (3) above, the proceeds of
any disposal (or an amount corresponding to it) must be applied in accordance with the
requirements of the Senior Documents (if any).

(5) In connection with any release contemplated in paragraphs(1), (2) or (3) above, the Security Agent
is authorised by each other Senior Creditor and Subordinated Creditor to execute on behalf of itself
and each such Senior Creditor and Subordinated Creditor without the need for any further referral
to, or authority from, any Senior Creditor, Subordinated Creditor or other party all necessary
releases of any security, liabilities or guarantees (including the Deed) given by any Obligor under
any Senior Document or Warner Village Security Document in relation to the disposal of any asset
which is permitted or not expressly prohibited or required under or consented to in accordance with
the Senior Documents including:

(i) any formal release of any asset which the Security Agent in its absolute discretion considers
necessary or desirable in connection with that disposal;

(ii) any release of any liability or guarantee (including the Deed) given under any Senior Document
or Warner Village Security Document or any other document referred to therein where all the
shares in the capital of the Obligor giving such guarantee (or any holding company of it) are so
disposed of in accordance with the terms of and without any breach of the Senior Documents;
and

(iii) any release of any security given by any Obligor which is, or is a subsidiary of a company which
is, sold in accordance with the terms of and without any breach of the Senior Documents.

**Instructions**

(1) After any Senior Creditor (or the Security Agent or relevant creditor representative on its behalf) has
taken any enforcement action under the Intercreditor Agreement (the ‘‘Enforcement Event’’) or after
any security constituted by the Senior Security Documents or any part of it is enforced, the Security
Agent shall (and is authorised by each other Senior Creditor to) act (or refrain from acting or
exercising any right, power, authority or discretion vested in it) in accordance with any instructions

145


-----

given to it by the relevant creditor representative pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement and such
instructions will override any contrary instructions given by or on behalf of the Subordinated
Creditors.

(2) Prior to the occurrence of the matters set out in paragraph (1) above, the Security Agent shall act in
accordance with:

(i) the terms of the Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement; or

(ii) instructions received from, or on behalf of the relevant Senior Creditors (or a creditor
representative on their behalf) pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement.

(3) The Security Agent will not be liable to any other Senior Creditor or Subordinated Creditor for any
act (or omission) if it acts (or refrains from taking any action) in accordance with the terms of the
Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement and, in particular, the Security Agent shall not be liable to the
Subordinated Creditors in complying with paragraph on release of security in the Warner Village
Intercreditor Agreement or any instructions of any Senior Creditor or the relevant Senior Creditors
(or a creditor representative on their behalf) under paragraph (1) above, if such action would have
required any consent under any Warner Village Security Document.

(4) Any instructions given to the Security Agent in accordance with the terms of the Warner Village
Intercreditor Agreement will be binding on all of the other Senior Creditors and Subordinated
Creditors and they shall not be entitled to object to anything done or omitted to be done as a result
of such instructions.

(5) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement, but subject to
the indemnity obligation in the Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of a conflict or
inconsistency between the Intercreditor Agreement and the Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement
in respect of the release of any security constituted by the Senior Security Documents or the Warner
Village Security Documents, the parties acknowledge that the release of such security shall be
deemed to be permitted (and the Security Agent shall be authorised to release such security) to the
extent that the release of the security is in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.

**Indemnity obligations**

Where there is a disposal of assets as contemplated in the paragraphs on release of security above and
such disposal is a disposal of a Guaranteed Lease or a Guaranteed Lease Company (as each such term
is defined in the Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement), the Security Agent will only be entitled to
release the security constituted by the Warner Village Security Documents and any guarantee (including
the Deed) where, as regards the purchaser of such Guaranteed Lease or Guaranteed Lease Company,
the provisions regarding the undertakings and indemnities to be given in respect of circuit sales and
individual multiplex sales in the Deed (to the extent applicable) have been complied with by the relevant
member of the Group, if requested by the Subordinated Creditor (acting reasonably).

In circumstances where there is a disposal of assets (other than shares or quotas (‘‘quotas’’ being, for
the purposes of this paragraph, participations akin to shares in respect of companies incorporated in
certain jurisdictions other than the UK)) as contemplated by the paragraphs on release of security
above:

- only the assets that are the subject of the disposal may be released from the security constituted by
the Warner Village Security Documents; and

- there may be no release in relation to such disposal of assets, of the company or companies which
owned such assets immediately prior to such disposal from the obligations contained in the Deed to
the extent that such obligations were binding on such company or companies prior to such
disposal.

In circumstances where there is a disposal of shares or quotas as contemplated in the paragraphs on
release of security above:

- only those shares or quotas and the assets owned by the company (and any of its subsidiaries)
whose shares or quotas are being disposed of whether directly or indirectly may be released from
the security constituted by the Warner Village Security Documents; and

146


-----

- the Deed may only be released in such circumstances to the extent that the company (and any of its
subsidiaries) whose shares or quotas are being disposed was bound by the Deed prior to such
disposal.

The provisions of the paragraphs above shall not apply in any respect following the occurrence of an
Enforcement Event.

**Subordinated Creditor rights**

Neither of the Subordinated Creditors nor any member of their respective Groups (as defined in the
Deed) shall be restricted by the terms of the Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement from exercising any
rights or remedies they may have under, amongst others, the Deed, Permitted WV Security and the WV
Acquisition Agreement (‘‘WV Transaction Documents’’) or any other agreement under which any of them
enjoy any rights for the time being (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the Warner Village Security
Documents the rights and remedies under which are regulated by the terms of the Warner Village
Intercreditor Agreement), provided that nothing contained in the WV Transaction Documents or any
other agreement in relation to the Warner Village Subordinated Debt shall override or supersede the
ranking and subordination arrangements contained in the Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement.

The Issuer and the Obligors (as defined in the Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement) undertake in favor
of the Subordinated Creditors that they will not agree to increase the aggregate amount of Senior Debt
(as defined in the Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement) after the date of such intercreditor agreement
which would result in the Issuer being in breach of its obligations under clause (b) of the second
paragraph under the caption ‘‘—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock’’ in the
‘‘Description of the Notes’’, in the form as at the date of the Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement
without the prior written consent of the Subordinated Creditors.

**Hedging Arrangements**

We currently maintain certain interest rate and basis swaps. For a description of our current hedging
arrangements, see ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations—Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosure about Market and Operating Risk—Interest Rate_
_Risk.’’ We currently intend to roll over certain of our existing interest rate and basis swaps in connection_
with the Transactions with the consent of the hedge counterparties. Pursuant to such roll over, the
hedging providers would benefit from security and guarantee rights that rank equally with the rights of
the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility.

**FFA Loan**

Certain entities in the CinemaxX group have been granted subsidies from the German Federal Film
Board (the ‘‘FFA’’) in an aggregate amount of approximately e1.5 million. These subsidies have been
granted in the forms of loans, most of which have a maturity period between four to six years. Most of the
loans were taken in connection with acquisition of plasma screens, undertaking renovation works and
refurbishment of cinemas.

**Rent Guarantees**

**_Germany_**

Certain entities in the CinemaxX group have entered into bank guarantee agreements with Hamburger
Sparkasse AG, Bayerische Landesbank, R+V Allgemeine Versicherung AG and UniCredit Bank AG in an
aggregate amount of approximately e22.6 million. All of these bank guarantees have been used to
guarantee the rent obligations of certain CinemaxX group entities under lease agreements. In
connection with these bank guarantees, cash collateral is held by the banks providing guarantees. See
‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and
_Capital Resources.’’_

**_Poland_**

In respect of certain Multikino properties, corporate guarantees were given in favour of the landlord to
guarantee the rent obligations. These guarantees are presently provided by International Trading and
Investments Holdings S.A Luxembourg (‘‘ITI’’) and an affiliate of ITI as group companies of
Multikino S.A.. The Multikino Acquisition Agreement imposes an obligation on the buyer to replace these
guarantees after completion of the Multikino Acquisition. Replacement guarantees will be offered from
Eudialyte Company sp. z o.o. The current aggregate value of these guarantees is approximately
e4.15 million.

The gross proceeds of the Offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date will be used as set forth in this
Offering Memorandum under the caption ‘‘Use of Proceeds.’’ Pending completion of the Acquisitions
and the satisfaction of certain other conditions as described under the caption ‘‘—Escrow of Proceeds;
Special Mandatory Redemption,’’ the Initial Purchasers will, concurrently with the closing of the Offering

accounts (the ‘‘Escrow Accounts’’) pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement (the ‘‘Escrow
_Agreement’’), dated as of the Issue Date, among, inter alios, the Company, the Trustee and The Bank of_
New York Mellon, London Branch, as escrow agent (the ‘‘Escrow Agent’’). If the conditions to the release
of the Escrowed Property (as defined below), as more fully described under the caption ‘‘—Escrow of
Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,’’ have not been satisfied on or prior to the Escrow Longstop
Date or the Extended Escrow Longstop Date (in each case, as defined below), as the case may be, or
upon the occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will be redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the
aggregate initial issue price of the Fixed Rate Notes and the Floating Rate Notes, plus accrued and
unpaid interest from the Issue Date to the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below) and
Additional Amounts (as defined below), if any. See ‘‘—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory
Redemption.’’

Following the Vue Acquisition Escrow Release (defined below), the Initial Vue Guarantors will become

Business Days for Aurora Cinema (Ireland) Limited) of the Vue Acquisition Completion Date (defined
below). Following the Multikino Acquisition Escrow Release (defined below), the Multikino Guarantors
will become parties to the Indenture and will Guarantee the Notes on a senior basis within 30 Business
Days of the later of (1) the Vue Acquisition Completion Date and (2) the Multikino Acquisition Completion
Date as set forth under the caption ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Post-Closing Guarantors and Post-Closing
Collateral—Multikino Guarantors.’’ On the earlier of (1) the date on which such entity becomes a
guarantor under the Revolving Credit Facility and (2) 20 Business Days following the occurrence of a
Structure Event, the CinemaxX Guarantors will become parties to the Indenture and will Guarantee the
Notes on a senior basis. Prior to the Vue Acquisition Completion Date and the Multikino Acquisition
Completion Date, the Company will not control Vue or any of its Subsidiaries or Multikino and any of its
Subsidiaries, respectively, and none of Vue nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor Multikino nor any of its
Subsidiaries, respectively, will be subject to the covenants described in this ‘‘Description of the Notes.’’
As such, we cannot assure you that prior to the Vue Acquisition Completion Date, Vue and any of its
Subsidiaries or, prior to the Multikino Acquisition Completion Date, Multikino and any of its Subsidiaries,
as the case may be, will not engage in activities that would otherwise have been prohibited by the
Indenture had those covenants been applicable to such entities from the Issue Date and prior to the Vue
Acquisition Completion Date or the Multikino Acquisition Completion Date, as the case may be.

Certain defined terms used in this description but not defined under the caption ‘‘—Certain Definitions’’
have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture. You can find the definitions of certain terms used
in this description under the caption ‘‘—Certain Definitions.’’ In this description, references to (i) the
‘‘Company’’ refers only to Vougeot Bidco p.l.c and not to any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) ‘‘we,’’ ‘‘our,’’ ‘‘us’’

The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture and the Notes and
refers to the Escrow Agreement, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Warner
Village Intercreditor Agreement, and certain other agreements relating to the Notes. This description
does not restate those agreements in their entirety. We urge you to read the Indenture, the Notes, the
Escrow Agreement, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Warner Village
Intercreditor Agreement because they, and not this description, define your rights as holders of the
Notes. Copies of the Indenture, the form of Note, the Escrow Agreement, the Security Documents, the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement are available as set forth under
the caption ‘‘—Additional Information.’’

The registered holder of a Note (each, a ‘‘Holder’’) will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only
registered holders will have rights under the Indenture.

As of the Issue Date, all of the Company’s Subsidiaries will be ‘‘Restricted Subsidiaries’’ for purposes of
the Indenture. Under the circumstances described under the caption ‘‘—Certain Covenants—
Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries,’’ the Company will be permitted to designate
Restricted Subsidiaries as ‘‘Unrestricted Subsidiaries.’’

**Brief Description of the Notes and the Guarantees**

**_The Notes_**

The Notes:

- will be general obligations of the Company;

- will be guaranteed by the Guarantors;

- will be secured by first-ranking Liens over the Collateral, but will receive proceeds from enforcement
of the Liens over the Collateral only after any obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and
certain priority Hedging Obligations have been paid in full;

- will be secured by a first-ranking Lien over the proceeds in the Escrow Accounts until the fulfillment
of the conditions set forth under the caption ‘‘—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory
Redemption’’;

- will be pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future obligations of the Company that are
not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including its obligations under the Revolving
Credit Facility;

- will be senior in right of payment to all existing and future Indebtedness of the Company that is
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;

- will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future obligations of the Company that are
secured by property or assets that do not secure the Notes or that secure the Revolving Credit
Facility and certain Hedging Obligations on a priority basis, to the extent of the value of the property
and assets securing such obligations; and

- will be structurally subordinated to any existing and future obligations of the Company’s
Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors.

**_Guarantees_**

The Notes will not be guaranteed on the Issue Date, however following (1) the Vue Acquisition
Completion Date, the Initial Vue Guarantors will Guarantee the Notes, (2) the Multikino Acquisition
Completion Date, the Multikino Guarantors will Guarantee the Notes, and (3) the occurrence of a
Structure Event, the CinemaxX Guarantors will Guarantee the Notes, each as set forth below. For a
description of certain guarantee limitations, see ‘‘Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the
Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.’’

The Guarantee of each Guarantor:

- will be a general obligation of that Guarantor;

- will be secured by first-ranking Liens over the Collateral, but will receive proceeds from enforcement
of the Liens over the Collateral only after any obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and
certain priority Hedging Obligations have been paid in full and will be secured by a first-ranking Lien

150


-----

over the proceeds in the Escrow Accounts until the fulfillment of the conditions set forth under the
caption ‘‘—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption’’;

- will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future obligations of the relevant Guarantor that
are secured by property or assets that do not secure such Guarantees, to the extent of the value of
the property and assets securing such obligations;

- will be pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future obligations of such Guarantor that
are not subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantee, including its obligations under the
Revolving Credit Facility;

- will be subject to certain restrictions on enforcement of Collateral, including a 30-day consultation
period with lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and an automatic release of the
Guarantee of any Guarantor to the extent such Subsidiary is sold by the Security Agent pursuant to
an enforcement action. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
Agreement; and

- will be senior in right of payment to all existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is
subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantee.

No later than the earlier of (1) the date on which such entity becomes a guarantor under the Revolving
Credit Facility and (2) two Business Days (or 15 Business Days in the case of Aurora Cinema (Ireland)
Limited) following the Vue Acquisition Completion Date, the Initial Vue Guarantors will accede to the
Indenture and will Guarantee the Notes. The Initial Vue Guarantors would have represented 69.7% of
Vue’s consolidated turnover and 66.6% of Vue’s EBITDA for the 53 week period ended April 4, 2013, on a
U.K. GAAP basis.

No later than the earlier of (1) the date on which such entity becomes a guarantor under the Revolving
Credit Facility and (2) 30 Business Days following the later of (a) the Vue Acquisition Completion Date
and (b) the Multikino Acquisition Completion Date, the Multikino Guarantors will accede to the Indenture
and will Guarantee the Notes. The Multikino Guarantors would have represented 83.6% of Multikino’s
consolidated revenue and 93.6% of Multikino’s EBITDA for the twelve month period ended March 31,
2013 on an IFRS basis.

We expect that the CinemaxX Guarantors will accede to the Indenture and will Guarantee the Notes no
later than the earlier of (1) the date on which such entity becomes a guarantor under the Revolving Credit
Facility and (2) 20 Business Days following the occurrence of a Structure Event. Pursuant to the
Indenture as described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Post-Closing Guarantors and Post-Closing
Collateral—CinemaxX Guarantors,’’ the Company is required, subject to the exceptions specified
thereunder, to use reasonable best efforts to cause Vue Beiteiligungs GmbH to implement a Structure
Event (the choice of Structure Event being in Vue Beiteiligungs GmbH’s discretion) as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the Issue Date. The CinemaxX Guarantors for the period following their
acquisition, would have represented 21.6% of Vue’s consolidated turnover and 23.8% of Vue’s EBITDA
for the 53 week period ended April 4, 2013. In aggregate, the Initial Vue Guarantors and the CinemaxX
Guarantors would have represented 91.3% of Vue’s consolidated turnover and 90.4% of Vue’s EBITDA
for the 53 week period ended April 4, 2013. Such percentages exclude the pre-acquisition results of
CinemaxX.

The Company is a holding company without operations, and, therefore, the Company depends on the
cash flow of its Subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including its obligation under the Notes. The Notes
will be effectively subordinated to all Indebtedness and other liabilities and commitments (including
trade payables and lease obligations) of the Company’s Subsidiaries that do not provide Guarantees.

**Intercreditor Agreement**

On or before the Issue Date, the Trustee will enter into an Intercreditor Agreement with, among others,
the agents and lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and holders of certain
Subordinated Shareholder Debt, the Security Agent and certain counterparties to our existing Hedging
Obligations. Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any liabilities in respect of obligations
under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain priority Hedging Obligations that are permitted to be incurred
by clause (8) of the second paragraph of the covenant under the caption ‘‘—Certain Covenants—
Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock’’ and certain future Indebtedness permitted
under the Indenture (subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement),

151


-----

if any, and permitted to be secured on the Collateral (see ‘‘—Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral
Liens’’) will receive priority with respect to any proceeds received upon any enforcement over any
Collateral. Any proceeds received upon any enforcement over any Collateral, after all obligations under
the Revolving Credit Facility have been repaid, certain future indebtedness permitted by the Indenture
(subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement), if any, and such
Super Senior Hedging Liabilities (as described in ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
Intercreditor Agreement’’) have been discharged from such recoveries, will be applied pro rata in
repayment of all obligations under the Indenture and the Notes and any other Indebtedness of the
Company and the Guarantors permitted to be incurred and secured by the Collateral on a pari passu
basis pursuant to the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

**Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement**

On or around the Issue Date, the Trustee will enter into the Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement, with,
among others, the Security Agent, Time Warner Entertainment Limited and VC Eye Pty Limited. Pursuant
to the terms of the Warner Village Counter-Indemnity (as defined in the Warner Village Intercreditor
Agreement), Time Warner Entertainment Limited and VC Eye Pty Limited are entitled to receive the
benefit of the Permitted WV Security. Pursuant to the terms of the Warner Village Intercreditor
Agreement, the rights of Time Warner Entertainment Limited and VC Eye Pty Limited in respect of the
Subordinated Security Documents (as defined in the Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement), will be
expressly subordinated to the holders of the Notes. The Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement
subordinates all present and future sums, liabilities or obligations from time to time due, owing or
incurred (actually or contingently) by any member of the group that grants security pursuant to the
Subordinated Security Documents to each of the Time Warner Time Warner Entertainment Limited and
VC Eye Pty Limited. The Warner Village Intercreditor does not subordinate any contractual claim that
Time Warner Entertainment Limited and VC Eye Pty Limited may have in respect of the Subordinated
Debt (as defined in the Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement). The Warner Village Intercreditor
Agreement will provide that Time Warner Entertainment Limited and VC Eye Pty Limited will not be
entitled to enforce security interests granted pursuant to the Subordinated Security Documents until the
Super Senior Discharge Date (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) has occurred, and any
proceeds arising out of the enforcement of the Collateral by the Security Agent, to the extent it also
constitutes Permitted WV Security, will only be paid to Time Warner Entertainment Limited and VC Eye
Pty Limited after repayment of the Credit Facility Indebtedness, Hedging Obligation Indebtedness and
Indebtedness incurred pursuant to the Indenture. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing
Arrangements—Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement.’’

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Company will issue £300.0 million aggregate principal amount of Fixed Rate Notes, and
e290.0 million aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Notes in this Offering. The Company may
issue additional Fixed Rate Notes (the ‘‘Additional Fixed Rate Notes’’) and additional Floating Rate Notes
(the ‘‘Additional Floating Rate Notes’’ and, together with the Additional Fixed Rate Notes, the ‘‘Additional
_Notes’’) under the Indenture from time to time after this Offering. Any issuance of Additional Notes is_
subject to all of the covenants in the Indenture, including the covenant described under the caption
‘‘—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock.’’ The Notes and
any Additional Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture will be treated as a single class for all
purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and
offers to purchase, except as otherwise provided in the Indenture. The Company will issue Notes in
denominations of £100,000 and integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof, in the case of the Fixed
Rate Notes, and in denominations of e100,000 and integral multiples of e1,000, in the case of the
Floating Rate Notes. The Notes will mature on July 15, 2020. Each of the Fixed Rate Notes and Floating
Rate Notes will constitute a separate series of Notes, but shall be treated as a single class for all
purposes under the Indenture, including in respect of any amendment, waiver or other modification of
the Indenture or any other action by the holders of the Notes hereunder, except as otherwise provided in
the Indenture.

**_Fixed Rate Notes_**

Interest on the Fixed Rate Notes will accrue at the rate of 7.875% per annum. Interest on the Fixed Rate
Notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears on February 1 and August 1, commencing on February 1,

152


-----

2014. Interest on overdue principal and interest, including Additional Amounts (as defined herein), if any,
will accrue at a rate that is 1% higher than the interest rate on the Fixed Rate Notes. The Company will
make each interest payment to the holders of record on the immediately preceding January 15 and
July 15.

Interest on the Fixed Rate Notes will accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has already
been paid, from the date it was most recently paid. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day
year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

**_Floating Rate Notes_**

The Company will also issue e290.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Notes in this
Offering. The Floating Rate Notes will bear interest at a rate per annum (the ‘‘Applicable Rate’’), reset
quarterly, equal to EURIBOR plus 5.25%, as determined by an agent appointed by the Company to
calculate EURIBOR for the purposes of the Indenture (the ‘‘Calculation Agent’’), which shall initially be
The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch.

Interest on the Floating Rate Notes will be payable quarterly in arrears on January 15, April 15, July 15
and October 15 of each year, commencing on October 15, 2013. If a particular interest payment date is
not a business day, then the payment date will move to the next business day. Therefore the interest
period will be one or more days longer. The Company will pay interest to the Holders of record on the
January 1, April 1, July 1 or October 1 immediately preceding the applicable interest payment date, as
the case may be. The Floating Rate Notes will bear interest from the Issue Date or, if interest has already
been paid, from the date it was most recently paid.

The Calculation Agent will, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on each Determination
Date, determine the Applicable Rate, and calculate the aggregate amount of interest payable on the
Floating Rate Notes in respect of the following Interest Period (the ‘‘Interest Amount’’). The Interest
Amount will be calculated by applying the Applicable Rate to the principal amount of the Floating Rate
Notes outstanding at the commencement of the Interest Period, multiplying each such amount by the
actual number of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 365.

All percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest
one hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point being
rounded upwards (e.g., 4.876545% (or 0.04876545) being rounded to 4.87655% (or 0.487655)). All euro
amounts used in or resulting from such calculations will be rounded to the nearest euro cent (with
one-half euro cent being rounded upwards). The determination of the Applicable Rate and the Interest
Amount by the Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of willful default, bad faith or manifest error, be
binding on all parties.

The Calculation Agent will, upon the written request of the Holder of any Floating Rate Note, provide the
interest rate then in effect with respect to the Floating Rate Notes.

The rights of holders of beneficial interests in the Floating Rate Notes to receive the payments of interest
on the Notes will be subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable.

Interest will be computed on the basis of a 365-day year and the actual number of days elapsed. Interest
on overdue principal and interest and Additional Amounts and premium, if any, will accrue at a rate that is
1% higher than the then Applicable Rate on the Floating Rate Notes.

The Applicable Rate on the Floating Rate Notes will in no event be higher than the maximum rate
permitted by applicable law.

Set forth below is a summary of certain of the defined terms used in the Indenture relating to the
calculation of interest on the Floating Rate Notes:

‘‘Determination Date,’’ with respect to an Interest Period, will be the day that is two TARGET Settlement
Days preceding the first day of such Interest Period.

‘‘EURIBOR,’’ with respect to an Interest Period, will be the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum)
for deposits in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days
after the Determination Date that appears on Reuters Screen EURIBOR 01 Page as of 11:00 a.m.
Brussels time, on the Determination Date. If Reuters Screen EURIBOR 01 Page does not include such a
rate or is unavailable on a Determination Date, the Calculation Agent will request the principal London
office of each of four major banks in the Euro-zone interbank market, as selected by the Calculation

153


-----

Agent to provide such bank’s offered quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of
approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such Determination Date, to prime banks in the Euro-zone
interbank market for deposits in a Representative Amount in euro for a three-month period beginning on
the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such offered
quotations are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations.
If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the Calculation Agent will request each of three major
banks in London, as selected by the Calculation Agent, to provide such bank’s rate (expressed as a
percentage per annum), as of approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such Determination Date, for
loans in a Representative Amount in euro to leading European banks for a three-month period beginning
on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such rates are
so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If fewer than two
such rates are so provided, then the rate for the Interest Period will be the rate in effect with respect to the
immediately preceding Interest Period.

‘‘Euro-zone’’ means the region composed of member states of the European Union that at the relevant
time have adopted the euro.

‘‘Interest Period’’ means the period commencing on and including an interest payment date and ending
on and including the day immediately preceding the next succeeding interest payment date, with the
exception that the first Interest Period shall commence on and include the Issue Date and end on and
exclude October 15, 2013.

‘‘Representative Amount’’ means the greater of (a) e1.0 million and (b) an amount that is representative
for a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time.

‘‘Reuters Screen EURIBOR 01 Page’’ means the display page so designated on Reuters (or such other
page as may replace that page on that service, or such other service as may be nominated as the
information vendor).

‘‘TARGET Settlement Day’’ means any day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross
Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET) System is open.

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes**

The Company will maintain one or more paying agents (each, a ‘‘Paying Agent’’) for the Notes, including
a Paying Agent in the City of London. The Company will ensure that it maintains a Paying Agent in a
member state of the European Union that will not be obliged to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to the
European Union Directive 2003/48/EC or any other directive implementing the conclusions of the
ECOFIN Council meeting of 26 and 27 November 2000 on the taxation of savings income, or any law
implementing, or complying with or introduced in order to conform to, such directive. The initial Paying
Agent in London will be The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch.

The Company will also maintain one or more registrars (each, a ‘‘Registrar’’) for so long as the Notes are
listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and its rules so require. The Company will also maintain a transfer
agent (a ‘‘Transfer Agent’’) in London. The initial Transfer Agent will be The Bank of New York Mellon,
London Branch. The Registrar and the Transfer Agent will maintain a register reflecting ownership of
Definitive Registered Notes (as defined under ‘‘Book-Entry, Delivery and Form’’) outstanding from time
to time and will make payments on and facilitate transfer of Definitive Registered Notes on behalf of the
Company.

The Company may change the Paying Agents, the Registrars or the Transfer Agents without prior notice
to the holders of Notes. For so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange
and admitted for trading on the Global Exchange Market and the rules of the rules of the Irish Stock
Exchange so require, the Company will publish a notice of any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or
Transfer Agent in a newspaper having a general circulation in Dublin (which is expected to be the Irish
_Times) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notice on the official_
website of the Irish Stock Exchange (www.ise.ie).

**Transfer and Exchange**

Each series of Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A
under the U.S. Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global Notes in registered form
without interest coupons attached (the ‘‘144A Global Notes’’), and each series of Notes sold outside the

154


-----

United States pursuant to Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act will initially be represented by one
or more global Notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the ‘‘Reg S Global Notes’’
and together with the 144A Global Notes, the ‘‘Global Notes’’).

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (the ‘‘Book-Entry Interests’’) will be limited to Persons that
have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or Persons that may hold interests through such
participants. Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the
restrictions on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under
‘‘Notice to Investors.’’ In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or
Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear or Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures and subject
to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream and their respective
participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes, or the ‘‘Restricted Book-Entry Interest,’’ may be
transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes,
as applicable, or the ‘‘Reg S Book-Entry Interests,’’ only upon delivery by the transferor of a written
certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in
accordance with Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act.

Any Book-Entry Interest (as defined under ‘‘Book-Entry, Delivery and Form’’) that is transferred as
described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest
in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note
to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer
restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to which it
was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of £100,000
and integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof, in the case of the Fixed Rate Notes, and minimum
denominations of e100,000 and integral multiples of e1,000 in excess thereof, in the case of the Floating
Rate Notes, upon receipt by the applicable Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates
and other documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based
upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant that owns the
relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest
will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Company in compliance with
applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer
summarized below and described more fully under ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may
be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of £100,000 and integral
multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof, in the case of the Fixed Rate Notes, and minimum denominations
of e100,000 and integral multiples of e1,000 in excess thereof, in the case of the Floating Rate Notes, to
persons who take delivery thereof in the form of Definitive Registered Notes. In connection with any such
transfer or exchange, the Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging holder to, among other
things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, furnish information regarding the
account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream where appropriate, furnish certain certificates and
opinions and pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or
exchange will be made without charge to the holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with
such transfer or exchange; _provided that, if the Company or any Guarantor takes delivery of the_
Definitive Registered Notes pursuant to the transfer or exchange, the holder will not be required to pay
such Taxes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company is not required to register the transfer of any Definitive
Registered Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes to be redeemed in
part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or

(4) which the holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of
Control Offer or an Asset Sale Offer.

155


-----

The Company, the Trustee and the Paying Agents will be entitled to treat the holder of a Note as the
owner of it for all purposes.

**Additional Amounts**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Company under or with respect to the Notes or any of the
Guarantors with respect to any Guarantee will be made free and clear of and without withholding or
deduction for, or on account of, any present or future Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such
Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or
levied by or on behalf of (1) any jurisdiction in which the Company or any Guarantor is then incorporated
or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes or any
political subdivision thereof or therein or (2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment is made by
or on behalf of the Company or any Guarantor (including the jurisdiction of any Paying Agent) or any
political subdivision thereof or therein (each, a ‘‘Tax Jurisdiction’’) will at any time be required to be made
from any payments made by or on behalf of the Company under or with respect to the Notes or any of
the Guarantors with respect to any Guarantee, including, without limitation, payments of principal,
redemption price, purchase price, interest or premium, the Company or the relevant Guarantor, as
applicable, will pay such additional amounts (the ‘‘Additional Amounts’’) as may be necessary in order
that the net amounts received in respect of such payments by each holder after such withholding,
deduction or imposition (including any such withholding, deduction or imposition from such Additional
Amounts) will equal the respective amounts that would have been received in respect of such payments
in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no Additional Amounts will be
payable with respect to:

(1) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been imposed but for the existence of any
present or former connection between the holder or the beneficial owner of the Notes (or between a
fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, partner of, member or shareholder of, or possessor of a power over, the
relevant holder, if the relevant holder is an estate, trust, nominee, partnership, limited liability
company or corporation) and the relevant Tax Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being or
having been a citizen, resident, or national thereof or being or having been present or engaged in a
trade or business therein or having or having had a permanent establishment therein), but
excluding any connection arising merely from the holding of such Note, the enforcement of rights
under such Note or under a Guarantee or the receipt of any payments in respect of such Note or a
Guarantee;

(2) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes were imposed as a result of the presentation of a Note for
payment (where presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made
available for payment to the holder (except to the extent that the holder would have been entitled to
Additional Amounts had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30 day period);

(3) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

(4) any Taxes withheld, deducted or imposed on a payment to an individual that are required to be
made pursuant to European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other directive implementing the
conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of November 26 and 27, 2000 on the taxation of
savings income, or any law implementing or complying with or introduced in order to conform to,
such directive;

(5) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to a payment made to a holder or beneficial owner of Notes
who would have been able to avoid such withholding or deduction by presenting the relevant Note
to another Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union;

(6) any Taxes payable other than by deduction or withholding from payments under, or with respect to,
the Notes or with respect to any Guarantee;

(7) any Taxes to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure of the holder or
beneficial owner of Notes, following the Company’s written request addressed to the holder or
beneficial owner (and made at a time that would enable the holder or beneficial owner acting
reasonably to comply with that request), to comply with any certification, identification, information
or other reporting requirements, whether required by statute, treaty, regulation or published
administrative practice of a Tax Jurisdiction, as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the
rate of deduction or withholding of, Taxes imposed by the Tax Jurisdiction (including, without
limitation, a certification that the holder or beneficial owner is not resident in the Tax Jurisdiction), but

156


-----

in each case, only to the extent the holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide such
certification or documentation;

(8) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to any payment by the Company or a Guarantor to the holder
if such holder is a fiduciary or partnership or any Person other than the sole beneficial owner of such
payment to the extent that Taxes would not have been imposed on such payments had such holder
been the sole beneficial owner of such Note; or

(9) any combination of items (1) through (8) above.

In addition to the foregoing, the Company and the Guarantors will also pay and indemnify the holders for
any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, or any other excise or
property Taxes, charges or similar levies (including penalties, interest and any other reasonable
expenses related thereto) which are levied by any Tax Jurisdiction on the execution, delivery, issuance or
registration of any of the Notes, the Indenture or any Guarantee or any other document referred to
therein (other than a transfer of the Notes other than the initial resale by the Initial Purchasers) or the
receipt of any payments with respect thereto (limited, solely in the case of taxes attributable to the receipt
of any payments with respect thereto, to any such taxes imposed in a Tax Jurisdiction that are not
excluded under clauses (1) through (5), (7) or (8) above or any combination thereof), or any such Taxes,
charges or similar levies imposed by any Tax Jurisdiction as a result of, or in connection with, the
enforcement of any of the Notes or any Guarantee.

If the Company or any Guarantor, as the case may be, becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay
Additional Amounts with respect to any payment under or with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee,
the Company or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, will deliver to the Trustee on a date that is at
least 30 days prior to the date of that payment (unless the Company or the relevant Guarantor becomes
aware of the obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to that payment date, in
which case the Company or the relevant Guarantor shall notify the Trustee promptly thereafter) an
Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to
be so payable. The Officer’s Certificate must also set forth any other information reasonably necessary to
enable the Paying Agents to pay Additional Amounts to holders on the relevant payment date. The
Trustee shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such
payments are necessary.

The Company or the relevant Guarantor will make or cause to be made all withholdings and deductions
required by law and will timely remit or cause to be remitted the full amount deducted or withheld to the
relevant Tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Company or the relevant Guarantor will use
its reasonable efforts to obtain Tax receipts from each Tax authority evidencing the payment of any Taxes
so deducted or withheld. The Company or the relevant Guarantor will furnish to the Trustee, within a
reasonable time after the date the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld is made, certified
copies of Tax receipts evidencing payment by the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, or if,
notwithstanding such entity’s efforts to obtain receipts, receipts are not obtained, other evidence of
payments (reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee) by such entity. Upon reasonable request, copies of tax
receipts or other evidence of payment, as the case may be, will be made available by the Trustee to the
holders or beneficial owners of the Notes. If requested by the Trustee, the Company or the Guarantors
will provide to the Trustee such information as may be in the possession of the Company or the
Guarantors (and not otherwise in the possession of the Trustee) to enable the Trustee to determine the
amount of withholding taxes attributable to any particular holder, provided, however, that in no event
shall the Company or the Guarantors be required to disclose any information that it reasonably deems to
be confidential.

Whenever in the Indenture or in this ‘‘Description of the Notes’’ there is mentioned, in any context, the
payment of amounts based upon the principal amount of the Notes or of principal, interest or of any
other amount payable under, or with respect to, any of the Notes or Guarantees, such mention shall be
deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context,
Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The above obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any
transfer by a holder or beneficial owner of its Notes, and will apply, mutatis mutandis, to any jurisdiction in
which any successor Person to the Company or any Guarantor is incorporated, organized, engaged in
business for tax purposes or resident for tax purposes or any jurisdiction from or through which such

157


-----

Person makes any payment on the Notes (or any Guarantee) and any department or political subdivision
thereof or therein.

**The Guarantees**

The Notes will be guaranteed by the companies listed under ‘‘—Brief Description of the Notes and the
Guarantees—Guarantees.’’ After the Vue Acquisition Completion Date, the Initial Vue Guarantors will
accede to the Indenture and Guarantee the Notes; after the Multikino Acquisition Completion Date, the
Multikino Guarantors will accede to the Indenture and Guarantee the Notes; and after the occurrence of
a Structure Event, the CinemaxX Guarantors will accede to the Indenture and Guarantee the Notes, each
as set forth under ‘‘—Brief Description of the Notes and Guarantees—The Guarantees.’’ The Guarantees
will be joint and several obligations of each Guarantor.

Each of the Guarantees and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited to the maximum amount
that can be guaranteed by a particular Guarantor without rendering its guarantee voidable or otherwise
ineffective under applicable law, including laws relating to fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer,
maintenance of share capital, corporate benefit, financial assistance or similar laws affecting the rights of
creditors generally, or otherwise to reflect applicable laws, including laws relating to capital maintenance
and the liability of directors and officers. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligations under its
Guarantee or any security interest, as applicable, could be significantly less than amounts payable in
respect of the Notes. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Each Guarantee will be subject to certain limitations on
enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defences that may limit its
validity and enforceability’’ and ‘‘Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the
Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.’’

The operations of the Company are conducted through its Subsidiaries and, therefore the Company
depends on the cash flow of its Subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the
Notes. Not all of the Company’s Subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. The Notes will be effectively
subordinated in right of payment to all obligations (including trade payables and lease obligations) of the
Company’s non-guarantor Subsidiaries. Any right of the Company or any Guarantor to receive assets of
any of its non-guarantor Subsidiaries upon that non-guarantor Subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization
(and the consequent right of the holders of the Notes to participate in those assets) will be effectively
subordinated to the claims of that non-guarantor Subsidiary’s creditors, except to the extent that the
Company or such Guarantor is itself recognized as a creditor of the non-guarantor Subsidiary, in which
case the claims of the Company or such Guarantor, as the case may be, would still be subordinated in
right of payment to any security in the assets of the non-guarantor Subsidiary and any obligations of the
non-guarantor Subsidiary senior to that held by the Company or such Guarantor.

**_Release of the Guarantees_**

The Guarantees will be released:

(1) in connection with any sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of that
Guarantor (including by way of merger, consolidation, amalgamation or combination) to a Person
that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary, if the sale, transfer or other disposition does not violate the ‘‘Asset Sale’’ provisions of
the Indenture;

(2) in connection with any sale, transfer or other disposition of Capital Stock of that Guarantor or any
holding company of such Guarantor to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to
such transaction) the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale, transfer or other disposition
does not violate the ‘‘Asset Sale’’ provisions of the Indenture and the Guarantor ceases to be a
Restricted Subsidiary as a result of the sale, transfer or other disposition;

(3) if the Company designates any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor to be an Unrestricted
Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

(4) upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as
provided under the captions ‘‘—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance’’ and ‘‘—Satisfaction
and Discharge’’;

(5) as permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(6) in accordance with the caption ‘‘—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver’’;

158


-----

(7) as a result of a transaction permitted by ‘‘—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets’’; or

(8) with respect to the Guarantee of any Guarantor that was required to provide such Guarantee
pursuant to the covenant described under the caption ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
Issuances of Guarantees of Indebtedness’’ upon such Guarantor being unconditionally released
and discharged from its liability with respect to the Indebtedness giving rise to the requirement to
provide such Guarantee so long as no Default or Event of Default would arise as a result and no
other Indebtedness is at that time guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor that would result in the
requirement that such Guarantor provide a Guarantee pursuant to the covenant described under
the caption ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Issuances of Guarantees of Indebtedness.’’

Upon any occurrence giving rise to a release as specified above, the Trustee will execute any documents
reasonably required in order to evidence or effect such release, discharge and termination in respect of
such Guarantee. Neither the Company nor any Guarantor will be required to make a notation on the
Notes to reflect any such release, termination or discharge.

**Collateral**

**_General_**

The Notes will initially be secured by a first-ranking Lien on the Escrowed Property deposited in the
Escrow Accounts, as described under the caption ‘‘—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory
Redemption.’’ The Escrowed Property that is deposited in the Escrow Accounts will not be pledged to
secure any obligations other than the Company’s obligations under the Notes. Upon the Vue Acquisition
Completion Date and the Multikino Acquisition Completion Date, the first-ranking liens over the
Escrowed Property will be released.

Prior to or on the Vue Acquisition Completion Date, the Notes and the Guarantees will be secured by
first-ranking Liens over the following Collateral (collectively, the ‘‘Vue Closing Collateral’’):

- the shares of the Issuer granted by Vougeot Midco Limited;

- certain receivables in respect of intercompany loans advanced by Vougeot Midco Limited to the
Issuer;

- certain bank accounts of the Issuer;

- the shares of Vue Entertainment International Limited; and

- assignment of rights in relation to the Vue Acquisition Agreement.

No later than the earlier of (1) the date on which the Revolving Credit Facility is secured by such Liens
over the below Collateral and (2) two Business Days (or 15 Business Days for Liens to be granted by
Aurora Cinema (Ireland) Limited) following the Vue Acquisition Completion Date, the Notes and the
Guarantees will be secured by first-ranking Liens over the following Collateral (collectively, the ‘‘Vue
_Post-Closing Collateral’’):_

- the shares of the Initial Vue Guarantors;

- the shares in certain Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Initial Vue Guarantors;

- certain bank accounts of the Initial Vue Guarantors;

- certain fixed and current assets of certain of the Initial Vue Guarantors;

- material real property of certain of the Initial Vue Guarantors;

- receivables in respect of certain of the Initial Vue Guarantors (including in certain cases,
assignments of rights under certain material contracts and certain insurance policies);

- certain intellectual property of certain of the Initial Vue Guarantors; and

- certain intercompany loans.

No later than the earlier of (1) the date on which the Revolving Credit Facility is secured by such Liens
over the below Collateral and (2) 30 Business Days following the later of (a) the Vue Acquisition
Completion Date and (b) the Multikino Acquisition Completion Date, the Notes and the Guarantees will

159


-----

be secured by first-ranking Liens over the following additional Collateral (collectively, the ‘‘Multikino
_Post-Closing Collateral’’):_

- registered pledge over certain of the assets and property rights of the Multikino Guarantors;

- registered and financial pledge over certain of the bank accounts of the Multikino Guarantors;

- registered and financial pledge over the shares of the Multikino Guarantors; and

- certain other material assets of certain of the Multikino Guarantors.

As described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Post-Closing Guarantors and Post-Closing Collateral—
CinemaxX Guarantors,’’ the Company is required, subject to the exceptions specified thereunder, to use
its reasonable best efforts to cause Vue Beiteiligungs GmbH to implement a Structure Event (the choice
of Structure Event being in Vue Beiteiligungs GmbH’s discretion) and, no later than the earlier of (1) the
date on which the Revolving Credit Facility is secured by such Liens over the below Collateral and (2) 20
Business Days following the occurrence of a Structure Event, to Guarantee the Notes and to secure the
Notes and the Guarantees with first-priority Liens over the following Collateral (such assets, the
‘‘CinemaxX Post-Closing Collateral’’):

- a global assignment of receivables over certain of the receivables of the CinemaxX Guarantors;

- share pledges over the shares of the CinemaxX Guarantors;

- pledges over certain of the bank accounts of the CinemaxX Guarantors; and

- certain other material assets of certain of the CinemaxX Guarantors.

The Collateral will be pledged pursuant to the Security Documents to the Security Agent on behalf of the
holders of the secured obligations that are secured by the Collateral, including the holders of the Notes,
the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and counterparties to certain Hedging
Obligations.

Under the Indenture, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to incur certain
additional Indebtedness that may share in the Collateral, including additional Permitted Collateral Liens
securing Indebtedness on a _pari passu basis with the Notes, including Indebtedness under the_
Revolving Credit Facility and certain priority Hedging Obligations (provided that the proceeds from any
recovery from the enforcement of any security interest will be applied to satisfy the obligations under the
Revolving Credit Facility, certain priority Hedging Obligations and certain future indebtedness permitted
under the Indenture (subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement
and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement), if any, before being applied to satisfy obligations to holders
under the Notes and the Indenture). The amount of such Permitted Collateral Liens will be limited by the
covenants described under the captions ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Liens’’ and ‘‘—Certain Covenants—
Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock.’’ Under certain circumstances, the amount
of such additional Indebtedness secured by Permitted Collateral Liens could be significant.

The obligations under the Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility, certain Hedging Obligations and certain
future Indebtedness permitted under the Indenture (subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Warner
Village Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement), if any, will be secured
equally and ratably by first-ranking Liens over the Collateral, however, any proceeds received upon any
enforcement over any of the Collateral will only be applied in repayment of the Notes, and all other debt
secured on a priority basis with the Notes, after all liabilities in respect of the obligations under the
Revolving Credit Facility and certain priority Hedging Obligations and certain future indebtedness
permitted by the Indenture (subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Warner Village Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement), if any, have been paid from such recoveries. See
‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement’’ and ‘‘Description of Certain
Financing Arrangements—Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement.’’

Under the Security Documents, the Collateral will be pledged by the Company and the Guarantors to
secure the payment when due of the Company’s and the Guarantors’, as applicable, payment
obligations under the Notes, the Guarantees and the Indenture. The Security Documents will be entered
into by, inter alios, the Security Agent or its nominee(s), who will act as Security Agent for the lenders
under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, counterparties to the Hedging Obligations, the Trustee
and for the holders of Notes.

160


-----

Each holder of Notes, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed (1) to have authorized the Trustee to enter
into the Intercreditor Agreement, the Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Agent to
enter into the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Warner Village Intercreditor
Agreement, and (2) to be bound thereby. Each holder of Notes, by accepting a Note, appoints the
Trustee or the Security Agent, as the case may be, as its agent under the Security Documents, the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement, and authorizes it to act as such.

The holders of the Notes are not a party to the Security Documents, and therefore holders may not,
individually or collectively, take any direct action to enforce any rights in their favor under the Security
Documents. The holders may only act through the Security Agent, as applicable. The Security Agent will
agree to any release of the security interest created by the Security Documents that is in accordance with
the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement without
requiring any consent of the holders. The Trustee will have the ability to direct the Security Agent to
commence enforcement action under the Security Documents in certain circumstances. See
‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement’’ and ‘‘Description of Certain
Financing Arrangements—Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement.’’

Subject to the terms of the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Security
Documents, the Company and the Guarantors, as the case may be, will be entitled to exercise any and
all voting rights and to receive and retain any and all cash dividends, stock dividends, liquidating
dividends, non-cash dividends, shares of stock resulting from stock splits or reclassifications, rights
issue, warrants, options and other distributions (whether similar or dissimilar to the foregoing) in respect
of the shares that are part of the Collateral until the occurrence of an Acceleration Event (as defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement).

The value of the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees may not be sufficient to satisfy the
Company’s and the Guarantors’ obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees, and the Collateral
securing the Notes and the Guarantees may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances,
including the issuance of Additional Notes and the disposition of assets comprising the Collateral,
subject to the terms of the Indenture. See ‘‘Risk Factors—The Proceeds from the enforcement of the
Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the Notes.’’

No appraisals of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Company or the Guarantors in
connection with this Offering of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the proceeds of any sale of
the Collateral, in whole or in part, pursuant to the Indenture and the Security Documents following an
Acceleration Event (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), would be sufficient to satisfy amounts
due on the Notes or the Guarantees. By its nature, some or all the Collateral may be illiquid and may
have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral
would be sold in a timely manner or at all. See ‘‘Risk Factors—It may be difficult to realize the value of the
Collateral.’’

’’The Security Documents will be governed by the law of the jurisdiction to which the relevant Collateral is
subject and provide that the rights with respect to the Notes and the Indenture must be exercised by the
Security Agent and in respect of the entire outstanding amount of the Notes. The term ‘‘Security
Interests’’ refers to the Liens in the Collateral.

Under the Indenture, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to incur certain
additional Indebtedness in the future that may share in the Collateral, including Indebtedness with
priority rights to proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral. The amount of such additional
Indebtedness will be limited by the covenants described under the captions ‘‘—Certain Covenants—
Liens’’ and ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock.’’
Under certain circumstances, the amount of such additional Indebtedness that may share in the
Collateral could be significant.

Each of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall, and shall procure that each of its respective
Subsidiaries, if any, shall, at its own expense, execute and do all such acts and things and provide such
assurances as the Security Agent may reasonably require (1) for registering any Security Document
relating to the Collateral in any required register and for perfecting or protecting the security intended to
be afforded by such Security Document relating to the Collateral; and (2) if such Security Document is
enforced in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement, for facilitating the realization of all or any part
of the assets which are subject to such Security Document and for facilitating the exercise of all powers,

161


-----

authorities and discretions vested in the Security Agent or in any receiver of all or any part of the
Collateral. Each of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall, and shall procure that each of its
respective Subsidiaries, if any, shall, execute such transfers, conveyances, assignments and releases of
that property whether to the Security Agent or to its nominees and give such notices, orders and
directions which the Security Agent may reasonably request.

**_Release of the Collateral_**

The Liens over the property and other assets constituting the Collateral securing the Notes and the
Guarantees will be released under any one or more of the following circumstances:

(1) in connection with any sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of such property
or assets (including Capital Stock of Subsidiaries) to a Person that is not (either before or after giving
effect to such transaction) the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, if the sale or other
disposition does not violate the ‘‘Asset Sale’’ provisions of the Indenture;

(2) in connection with any sale, transfer or other disposition of Capital Stock of that Guarantor or any
holding company of such Guarantor to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to
such transaction) the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale, transfer or other disposition
does not violate the ‘‘Asset Sale’’ provisions of the Indenture and the Guarantor ceases to be a
Restricted Subsidiary as a result of the sale, transfer or other disposition;

(3) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Indenture,
the release of the property and assets of such Guarantor;

(4) if the Company designates any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets of
such Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as
provided under the captions ‘‘—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance’’ and ‘‘—Satisfaction
and Discharge;’’

(6) as permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement, the Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement, and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) in accordance with the caption ‘‘—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver;’’

(8) in accordance with the covenant described under the caption ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Impairment
of Security Interest;’’ and

(9) upon a release of the Lien that resulted in the creation of the Lien under the covenant described
under the caption ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Liens.’’

The foregoing will not cause or permit, directly or indirectly, the Lien on the Capital Stock of the Company
to be released, other than as expressly provided by (5) and (6) above.

The Security Agent will take all necessary action required to effectuate any release of Collateral securing
the Notes and the Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and
the relevant Security Document. Each of the releases set forth above shall be affected by the Security
Agent without the consent of the holders or any action on the part of the Trustee.

**Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption**

Concurrently with the closing of the Offering of the Notes on the Issue Date, the Company will enter into
the Escrow Agreement, pursuant to which the Initial Purchasers will deposit with the Escrow Agent an
amount equal to the gross proceeds of the Offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date into the Escrow
Accounts. The Escrow Accounts will be controlled by the Trustee and pledged on a first ranking basis in
favor of the Trustee for the benefit of the holders of the Notes pursuant to an escrow charge dated the
Issue Date between the Company and the Trustee (the ‘‘Escrow Charge’’). The initial funds deposited in
the Escrow Account, and all other funds, securities, interest, dividends, distributions and other property
and payments credited to the Escrow Account (less any property and/or funds paid in accordance with
the Escrow Agreement) are referred to, collectively, as the ‘‘Escrowed Property.’’

**_Vue Acquisition Escrow Release_**

In order to cause the Escrow Agent to release £499.4 million equivalent of the Escrowed Property to the
Company (the ‘‘Vue Acquisition Escrow Release’’) to be used to fund the acquisition of Vue
Entertainment International Limited as discussed in the Offering Memorandum (the ‘‘Vue Acquisition’’),
the Escrow Agent and the Trustee must have received from the Company, at a time that is on or before
the Escrow Longstop Date (as defined below), an Officer’s Certificate certifying that:

(1) prior to or concurrently with the Vue Acquisition Escrow Release, the Equity Contribution will be
made;

(2) all conditions under the Vue Acquisition Agreement have been, or promptly upon the Vue
Acquisition Escrow Release will be, satisfied in full (or waived by the relevant parties except for
waivers that are materially adverse to the interests of the holders of the Notes) and, promptly upon
the Vue Acquisition Escrow Release, the Vue Acquisition will be completed in accordance with the
terms of the Vue Acquisition Agreement as in effect on the Issue Date, except for any changes,
waivers or other modifications that are not, individually or when taken as whole, materially adverse
to the interests of the holders of the Notes;

(3) promptly following the release of £499.4 million equivalent of the Escrowed Property, the Company
will own all of the outstanding Capital Stock of Vue Entertainment International Limited and the
intercompany debt issued by Vue Entertainment International Limited to its shareholders;

(4) The Company will have executed and delivered, effective as of the Vue Acquisition Escrow Release,
the applicable Security Documents;

(5) the £499.4 million equivalent of the Escrowed Property that is released will be applied in
substantially the same manner as described in this Offering Memorandum;

(6) on the Vue Acquisition Completion Date, legal opinions and officer certificates substantially in the
form of those attached as appendices to the Escrow Agreement (or in the form as agreed between
the Company and the Trustee following the date hereof) will have been delivered to the Initial

**_Special Mandatory Redemption_**

In the event that (1) the Vue Acquisition Completion Date does not take place on or prior to
September 30, 2013 (the ‘‘Escrow Longstop Date’’); (2) there occurs a repudiation by the Company of
any of its obligations under the Escrow Agreement or the unenforceability of the Escrow Agreement
against the Company for any reason; (3) in the reasonable judgment of the Company, the Vue
Acquisition will not be completed by the Escrow Longstop Date; (4) any of the conditions set forth under
the first paragraph under this caption ‘‘—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption—Vue
Acquisition Escrow Release’’ become incapable of being satisfied on or prior to the Escrow Longstop
Date; or (5) a Default or Event of Default arises under the caption ‘‘—Events of Default and Remedies,’’ in
each case, on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date (the date of such event being the ‘‘Vue Special
_Termination Date’’) the Company will redeem all of the Notes (the ‘‘Vue Mandatory Redemption’’) at a_
price (the ‘‘Vue Mandatory Redemption Price’’) equal to 100% of the issue price of such Notes, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to the Special
Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below).

In the event that (1) the Multikino Acquisition Completion Date does not take place on or prior to
December 1, 2013 (the ‘‘Extended Escrow Longstop Date’’); (2) there occurs a repudiation by the
Company of any of its obligations under the Escrow Agreement or the unenforceability of the Escrow
Agreement against the Company for any reason; (3) in the reasonable judgment of the Company, the
Multikino Acquisition will not be completed by the Extended Escrow Longstop Date; (4) any of the
conditions set forth under the first paragraph under this caption ‘‘—Escrow of Proceeds; Special
Mandatory Redemption—Multikino Acquisition Escrow Release’’ become incapable of being satisfied
on or prior to the Extended Escrow Longstop Date; or (5) a Default or Event of Default arises under the
caption ‘‘—Events of Default and Remedies,’’ in each case, on or prior to the Extended Escrow Longstop
Date (the date of such event being the ‘‘Multikino Special Termination Date’’), the Company will redeem
(the ‘‘Multikino Mandatory Redemption’’) Notes with an aggregate principal amount equal to
£50.0 million (or the equivalent) (or such lesser or greater amount as left in the Escrow Accounts after the
Vue Acquisition Escrow Release) at a price (the ‘‘Multikino Mandatory Redemption Price’’) equal to 100%
of the issue price of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from
the Issue Date to the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below).

Notice of the Vue Mandatory Redemption or Multikino Mandatory Redemption, as the case may be, will
be delivered by the Company, no later than one Business Day following the Vue Special Termination
Date or the Multikino Special Termination Date, as the case may be, to the Trustee, the Paying Agent and
the Escrow Agent, and will provide that the Notes shall be redeemed no later than one Business Day
after such notice is received by the Escrow Agent (the ‘‘Special Mandatory Redemption Date’’). On the
Special Mandatory Redemption Date, the Escrow Agent shall pay the amounts to the Paying Agent for
payment to each holder of Notes the Vue Mandatory Redemption Price or Multikino Mandatory

164


-----

Redemption Price, as applicable, for such holder’s Notes and, concurrently with the payment to such
holders, deliver any excess Escrowed Property (if any) to the Company.

Each of OMERS Administration Corporation and the AIMCo Guarantor (each, an ‘‘Overfund Guarantor’’)
will enter into an agreement with the Trustee on or prior to the Issue Date (the ‘‘Overfund Guarantee’’) to
guarantee the obligations of the Issuer in an amount of approximately £4.7 million per Overfund
Guarantor to pay the Overfunding Amount to the Paying Agent in the event of a Vue Mandatory
Redemption, in either such case, no later than one Business Day prior to the applicable Special
Mandatory Redemption Date for the Vue Mandatory Redemption. Each Overfund Guarantee will be
limited to approximately £4.7 million per Overfund Guarantor and any Overfund Amount in excess of the
aggregate amount of the Overfund Guarantees will be the sole responsibility of the Issuer.

The ‘‘Overfunding Amount’’ will be an amount equal to the sum of the interest that will accrue on the
aggregate principal amount of Notes, the proceeds of which constitute Escrowed Property, from the
Issue Date up to the Special Mandatory Redemption Date for the Vue Mandatory Redemption. The funds
from the Overfund Guarantee will be applied by the Trustee to provide for the payment of the
Overfunding Amount, to the extent and as applicable, on a Special Mandatory Redemption Date for the
Vue Mandatory Redemption. If the Special Mandatory Redemption Date for the Vue Mandatory
Redemption is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment date, the
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is registered at the
close of business on such record date and no additional interest will be payable to holders whose Notes
are subject to such a redemption by the Company.

If at the time of the Vue Mandatory Redemption or the Multikino Mandatory Redemption, the Notes are
listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and the rules of the Irish Stock Exchange so require, the Company will
notify the Irish Stock Exchange that the Vue Mandatory Redemption or the Multikino Mandatory
Redemption, as applicable, has occurred and any relevant details relating to the Vue Mandatory
Redemption or the Mulitkino Mandatory Redemption, as applicable.

No provisions of the Escrow Agreement (including, without limitation, those relating to the release of the
Escrowed Property) and, to the extent such provisions relate to the Company’s obligation to redeem the
Notes in the Vue Mandatory Redemption or the Multikino Mandatory Redemption, the Indenture, may be
waived or modified in any manner materially adverse to the holders of the Notes without the consent of at
least 90% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes effected thereby.

**Optional Redemption**

**_Fixed Rate Notes_**

At any time prior to July 15, 2016 the Company may on any one or more occasions, upon not less than
30 nor more than 60 days’ notice, redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Fixed Rate
Notes issued under the Indenture at a redemption price equal to 107.875% of the principal amount of the
Fixed Rate Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the
date of redemption (subject to the rights of holders of the Fixed Rate Notes on the relevant record date to
receive interest on the relevant interest payment date), with the net cash proceeds of an Equity Offering
of (i) the Company or (ii) any Parent Entity to the extent the proceeds from such Equity Offering are
contributed to the Company’s common equity capital or are paid to the Company as consideration for
the issuance of ordinary shares of the Company; provided that:

(1) at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the Fixed Rate Notes, originally issued under the
Indenture (excluding the Fixed Rate Notes held by the Company and its Subsidiaries) remains
outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such redemption; and

(2) the redemption occurs within 90 days of the date of the closing of such Equity Offering.

At any time prior to July 15, 2016 the Company may on any one or more occasions upon not less than 30
nor more than 60 days’ notice, redeem all or a part of the Fixed Rate Notes at a redemption price equal to
100% of the principal amount of the Fixed Rate Notes redeemed, plus the Applicable Premium as of, and
accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of redemption, subject to the
rights of holders of the Fixed Rate Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
relevant interest payment date.

Except pursuant to the preceding two paragraphs and except pursuant to ‘‘—Escrow of Proceeds;
Special Mandatory Redemption—Special Mandatory Redemption’’ and ‘‘—Redemption for Changes in

165

Taxes,’’ the Fixed Rate Notes will not be redeemable at the Company’s option prior to,
2016.

On or after July 15, 2016, the Company may on any one or more occasions redeem all or a part of the
Fixed Rate Notes upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at the redemption prices
(expressed as percentages of principal amount) set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, on the Fixed Rate Notes redeemed, to the applicable date of redemption, if
redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on July 15 of the years indicated below, subject to
the rights of holders of the Fixed Rate Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest on the relevant
interest payment date:

Unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the
Fixed Rate Notes or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.

Any redemption or notice may, in the Company’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more
conditions precedent.

**_Floating Rate Notes_**

At any time prior to July 15, 2014 the Company may, on any one or more occasions, upon not less than
30 nor more than 60 days’ notice redeem all or a part of the Floating Rate Notes, at a redemption price
equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Floating Rate Notes redeemed, plus the Applicable
Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of
redemption, subject to the rights of holders of the Floating Rate Notes on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date.

Except pursuant to the preceding paragraph and except pursuant to ‘‘—Escrow of Proceeds; Special
Mandatory Redemption—Special Mandatory Redemption’’ and ‘‘—Redemption for Changes in Taxes,’’
the Floating Rate Notes will not be redeemable at the Company’s option prior to July 15, 2014.

On or after July 15, 2014, the Company may on any one or more occasions redeem all or a part of the
Floating Rate Notes upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at the redemption prices
(expressed as percentages of principal amount) set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, on the Floating Rate Notes redeemed, to the applicable date of redemption, if

Unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the
Floating Rate Notes or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.

Any redemption or notice may, in the Company’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more
conditions precedent.

**Redemption for Changes in Taxes**

The Company may redeem the Notes, in whole but not in part, at its discretion at any time upon giving
not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice to the holders of the Notes (which notice will be
irrevocable and given in accordance with the procedures described in ‘‘—Selection and Notice’’), at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, together with accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed by the Company for redemption (a ‘‘Tax Redemption Date’’) and
all Additional Amounts (if any) then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a
result of the redemption or otherwise (subject to the right of holders of the Notes on the relevant record

date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date and Additional Amounts (if any) in
respect thereof), if on the next date on which any amount would be payable in respect of the Notes or
any Guarantee, the Company under or with respect to the Notes or any of the Guarantors with respect to
any Guarantee is or would be required to pay Additional Amounts (but, in the case of the relevant
Guarantor, only if such amount cannot be paid by the Company or another Guarantor who can pay such
amount without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts), and the Company or relevant Guarantor, as
applicable, cannot avoid any such payment obligation by taking reasonable measures available
(including making payment through a paying agent located in another jurisdiction) and the requirement
arises as a result of:

(1) any amendment to, or change in, the laws or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder of a
relevant Tax Jurisdiction which change or amendment has not been publicly announced as formally
proposed before and which becomes effective on or after the date of this Offering Memorandum (or,
if the applicable Tax Jurisdiction became a Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the date of this Offering
Memorandum, such later date); or

(2) any amendment to, or change in, an official written interpretation or application of such laws,
regulations or rulings (including by virtue of a holding, judgment, order by a court of competent
jurisdiction or a change in published practice) which amendment or change has not been publicly
announced as formally proposed before and which becomes effective on or after the date of the
Offering Memorandum, (or, if the applicable Tax Jurisdiction became a Tax Jurisdiction on a date
after the date of this Offering Memorandum, such later date) (each of the foregoing clauses (1) and
(2), a ‘‘Change in Tax Law’’).

The Company will not give any such notice of redemption earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on
which the Company or the Guarantor, as applicable, would be obligated to make such payment or
withholding if a payment in respect of the Notes were then due, and the obligation to pay Additional
Amounts must be in effect (or be scheduled to come into effect on or prior to the next date on which any
amount would be payable under or in respect of the Notes or any Guarantee) at the time such notice is
given. Prior to the publication or, where relevant, mailing of any notice of redemption of the Notes
pursuant to the foregoing, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an opinion of independent tax counsel
(the choice of such counsel to be subject to the prior written approval of the Trustee (such approval not
to be unreasonably withheld)) to the effect that there has been such Change in Tax Law which would
entitle the Company to redeem the Notes hereunder. In addition, before the Company publishes or mails
any notice of redemption of the Notes as described above, it will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate to the effect that it (or the relevant Guarantor) cannot avoid its obligation to pay Additional
Amounts by taking reasonable measures available to it (including in the case of a Guarantor, that such
amount cannot be paid by the Company or another Guarantor who can pay such amount without the
obligation to pay Additional Amounts).

The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely (without any liability on the part of the Trustee arising
from such reliance) on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion of counsel as sufficient evidence of the
existence and satisfaction of the conditions precedent as described above, in which event it will be
conclusive and binding on the holders.

The foregoing provisions shall apply mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor
Person becomes a party to the Indenture, with respect to a Change in Tax Law occurring after the time
such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture.

**Mandatory Redemption**

Except as set forth under the caption ‘‘—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption—Special
Mandatory Redemption,’’ the Company is not required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund
payments with respect to the Notes.

**Repurchase at the Option of Holders**

**_Change of Control_**

If a Change of Control occurs, each holder of Notes will have the right to require the Company to
repurchase all or any part (in integral multiples of £1,000 for the Fixed Rate Notes and in integral
multiples of e1,000 for the Floating Rate Notes; provided that Fixed Rate Notes of £100,000 or less and
Floating Rate Notes of e100,000 or less may only be redeemed in whole and not in part) of that holder’s

167


-----

Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer on the terms set forth in the Indenture. In the Change of
Control Offer, the Company will offer a payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount
of Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes
repurchased to the date of purchase (the ‘‘Change of Control Payment’’), subject to the rights of holders
of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date.

Unless the Company has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes of a series as
described under ‘‘—Optional Redemption’’ or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or
waived, within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Company will mail a notice to each holder of
the Notes at such holder’s registered address or otherwise deliver a notice in accordance with the
procedures described under ‘‘—Selection and Notice,’’ stating that a Change of Control Offer is being
made and offering to repurchase Notes on the date (the ‘‘Change of Control Payment Date’’) specified in
the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice
is mailed or delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such
notice. The Change of Control Offer shall be open for a period of no less than 20 days, and the Company
will comply with the requirements of any applicable securities laws and regulations to the extent those
laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a
Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict
with the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with any applicable
securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the
Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of
Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all
Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered; and

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes properly accepted together with an Officer’s
Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of Notes being purchased by
the Company.

The Paying Agent will promptly mail (or cause to be delivered) to each holder of the Notes properly
tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee (or its authenticating agent)
will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each holder a new Note
equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any. The Company
will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the
Change of Control Payment Date.

The provisions described above that require the Company to make a Change of Control Offer following a
Change of Control will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable.
Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture will not contain provisions
that permit the holders of the Notes to require that the Company repurchase or redeem the Notes in the
event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if (1) a
third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance
with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the
Company and purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control
Offer, or (2) a notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described above under
the caption ‘‘—Optional Redemption,’’ unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable
redemption price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer
may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change
of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control
Offer is made.

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will provide that the occurrence of a change of control would in
each case require the repayment of all the outstanding Indebtedness thereunder. If the Company
experiences a change of control that triggers a mandatory prepayment under its Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement, the Company may seek the agreement of the relevant lenders thereunder to maintain the
availability of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or seek to refinance the Revolving Credit Facility

-----

Agreement. Future debt of the Company or its Subsidiaries may prohibit the Company from purchasing
the Notes in the event of a Change of Control or provide that a Change of Control is a default or require a
repurchase upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the holders of the Notes of their right to
require the Company to purchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of,
other debt, even if a Change of Control does not, due to the financial effect of the purchase on the
Company.

Finally, the Company’s ability to repurchase Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer following the
occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by the Company’s then existing financial resources.
There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make the required
purchase of the Notes. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the Guarantees—We may
not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance a change of control offer.’’

The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer,
conveyance or other disposition of ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the properties or assets of the Company
and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting
the phrase ‘‘substantially all,’’ there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable
law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of the Notes to require the Company to repurchase its Notes as a
result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain.

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase
the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the consent of the holders of
a majority in principal amount of the Notes prior to the occurrence of the Change of Control.

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and admitted for
trading on the Global Exchange Market and the rules of the Irish Stock Exchange so require, the
Company will publish a public announcement with respect to the results of any Change of Control Offer
in a leading newspaper of general circulation in Ireland (which is expected to be the Irish Times) or, to the
extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notice on the official website of the Irish
Stock Exchange (www.ise.ie).

**_Asset Sales_**

The Company will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or
indirectly, consummate an Asset Sale unless:

(1) the Company (or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives consideration at the time
of the Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value of the assets or Equity Interests issued or
sold or otherwise disposed of; and

(2) at least 75% of the consideration received in the Asset Sale by the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents. For purposes of this provision, each of the
following will be deemed to be cash:

(a) any liabilities, as recorded on the balance sheet of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
(other than contingent liabilities and other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated in
right of payment to the Notes or any Guarantee or are not otherwise permitted to be
repurchased with the Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale pursuant to the second paragraph
under this covenant), that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets and as a result of
which the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries are no longer obligated with respect to such
liabilities or are indemnified against further liabilities;

(b) any securities, notes or other obligations received by the Company or any such Restricted
Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents within 90 days following the closing of the Asset Sale,
to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received in that conversion;

(c) any Capital Stock or assets of the kind referred to in clauses (1)(d) or (f) of the next paragraph of
this covenant;

(d) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary in such Asset Sales having an aggregate Fair Market Value, taken together with all
other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (d) that is at that

time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of £30.0 million and 4.0% of Total Assets at the time
of the receipt of such Designated Non-Cash Consideration (with the Fair Market Value of each
item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without
giving effect to subsequent changes in value);

(e) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result
of such Asset Sale, to the extent that the Company and each other Restricted Subsidiary are
released from any guarantee of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Sale; and

(f) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Company or any Guarantor of a type set forth
in clause (1) of the following paragraph, received from Persons who are not the Company or
any Restricted Subsidiary.

Within 365 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale, the Company (or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries) may:

(1) apply such Net Proceeds (at the option of the Company or Restricted Subsidiary):

(a) to purchase the Notes pursuant to an offer made on a pro rata basis to all of the holders of
Notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and
unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of purchase (a ‘‘Notes Offer’’);

(b) (i) to repay Indebtedness of the Company or any Guarantor outstanding under clause (1) of the
second paragraph of the covenant under the caption ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of
Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock’’ that is secured by a first-priority Lien on the
Collateral and that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or any Guarantee and, if
the Indebtedness repaid is revolving credit Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce
commitments with respect thereto; or (ii) to make an Asset Sale Offer (as defined below) on a
_pro rata basis to all holders of the Notes and holders of other Indebtedness that is secured by a_
Lien on the Collateral and that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or the
Guarantees;

(c) to purchase or permanently prepay or redeem or repay (i) any Indebtedness that is only
secured by Liens on assets or property that do not constitute Collateral and, if the Indebtedness
prepaid, redeemed or repaid is revolving credit Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce
commitments with respect thereto or (ii) any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not
a Guarantor, other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary
(or any Affiliate thereof);

(d) to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Permitted
Business, if, after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Permitted Business
is or becomes a Restricted Subsidiary;

(e) to make a capital expenditure;

(f) to acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock) not classified as current assets under
UK GAAP that are used or useful in a Permitted Business; or

(g) in connection with an Asset Sale with respect to assets acquired by the Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries after the Issue Date (other than the assets acquired as part of the
Transactions) which was part of a larger acquisition of assets (the ‘‘Primary Acquisition’’) or with
respect to assets that in the Company’s good faith judgment would create value being
disposed alongside the disposal of assets from the Primary Acquisition, to purchase or
permanently prepay, redeem, repay, reimburse or otherwise return (including in the form of a
dividend or other distribution) (each, a ‘‘Reimbursement’’) any portion of the source of funds
used to finance the Primary Acquisition; provided that, for the Company’s most recently ended
four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately
preceding the date on which such Reimbursement is made (and, for the avoidance of doubt,
after giving pro forma effect to the Asset Sale (including the incurrence of any Indebtedness to

and the Primary Acquisition), at the time of such Reimbursement (i) the Company’s Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0, or (ii) the Company’s Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio would not be less than it was immediately prior to such Reimbursement; or

(2) enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Proceeds pursuant to clause (d), (e) or (f) of
paragraph (1) above; _provided that such binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted_
application of the Net Proceeds from the date of such commitment until the earlier of (a) the date on
which such acquisition or expenditure is consummated, and (b) the 180[th] day following the
expiration of the aforementioned 365 day period.

Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds, the Company (or the applicable Restricted
Subsidiary) may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest the Net Proceeds in
any manner that is not prohibited by the Indenture.

Any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided in the second paragraph
of this covenant will constitute ‘‘Excess Proceeds.’’ When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds
exceeds £15.0 million, within ten Business Days thereof, the Company will make an offer (an ‘‘Asset Sale
_Offer’’) to all holders of Notes and, to the extent notified by the Company in such notice, make an offer to_
all holders of other Indebtedness that is pari passu with the Notes or any Guarantee to purchase, prepay
or redeem with the proceeds of sales of assets, the maximum principal amount of Notes and such other
_pari passu Indebtedness (plus all accrued interest on the Indebtedness and the amount of all fees and_
expenses, including premiums, incurred in connection therewith) that may be purchased, prepaid or
redeemed out of the Excess Proceeds. The offer price for the Notes in any Asset Sale Offer will be equal
to 100% of the principal amount and the offer price for any pari passu Indebtedness may be no greater
than 100% of the principal amount, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to the date of purchase, prepayment or redemption, subject to the rights of holders of
Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date, and will
be payable in cash. If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer, the
Company may use those Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If
the aggregate principal amount of Notes and other pari passu Indebtedness tendered into (or to be
prepaid or redeemed in connection with) such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds
or if the aggregate amount of Notes tendered pursuant to a Notes Offer exceeds the amount of the Net
Proceeds so applied, the Trustee will select the Notes and such other _pari passu Indebtedness, if_
applicable, to be purchased on a pro rata basis (or in the manner described under ‘‘—Selection and
Notice’’), based on the amounts tendered or required to be prepaid or redeemed. Upon completion of
each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Proceeds payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a
currency other than sterling or euro, as the case may be, the amount thereof payable in respect of such
Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in sterling or euro, as the case may be, that is actually
received by the Company upon converting such portion of the Net Proceeds into sterling or euro, as the
case may be.

An Asset Sale Offer or a Notes Offer shall be open for a period of no less than 20 days, and the Company
will comply with the requirements of any applicable securities laws and regulations to the extent those
laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of an
Asset Sale Offer or a Notes Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations
conflict with the Change of Control, Asset Sale or Notes Offer provisions of the Indenture, the Company
will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached
its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee will select Notes for redemption
on a pro rata basis (or, in the case of Notes issued in global form as discussed under ‘‘Book-Entry,
Delivery and Form,’’ based on a method that most nearly approximates a pro rata selection as the
Trustee deems fair and appropriate), unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange or
depository requirements. The Trustee shall not be liable for selections made by it in accordance with this
paragraph.

No Fixed Rate Notes of £100,000 or less can be redeemed in part and no Floating Rate Notes of
e100,000 or less can be redeemed in part. Notices of redemption will be mailed by first class mail at least
30 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of Notes to be redeemed at its
registered address, except that redemption notices may be mailed more than 60 days prior to a
redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and
discharge of the Indenture.

171


-----

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note will state the
portion of the principal amount of that Note that is to be redeemed. A new Note in principal amount equal
to the unredeemed portion of the original Note will be issued in the name of the holder of the Notes upon
cancellation of the original Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on
such Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion
thereof. Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the
redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of Notes called for redemption.

For Notes which are represented by global certificates held on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream,
notices may be given by delivery of the relevant notices to Euroclear or Clearstream for communication
to entitled account holders in substitution for the aforesaid mailing. So long as any Notes are listed on
the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Global Exchange Market and
the rules of the Irish Stock Exchange so require, any such notice to the holders of the relevant Notes shall
also be published in a newspaper having a general circulation in Ireland (which is expected to be the
_Irish Times) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, posted on the official website of_
the Irish Stock Exchange (www.ise.ie) and, in connection with any redemption, the Company will notify
the Irish Stock Exchange of any change in the principal amount of Notes outstanding.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock_**

The Company will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or
indirectly, create, incur, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable,
contingently or otherwise, with respect to (collectively, ‘‘incur’’) any Indebtedness (including Acquired
Debt), and the Company will not issue any Disqualified Stock and will not permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to issue any shares of preferred stock; provided, however:

(1) that the Company may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) or issue Disqualified Stock,
and any Restricted Subsidiary may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) or issue preferred
stock, if on the date on which such additional Indebtedness is incurred or such Disqualified Stock or
such preferred stock is issued, as the case may be, if the Company’s Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio
for the Company’s most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial
statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is
incurred or such Disqualified Stock or such preferred stock is issued, as the case may be, would
have been at least 2.0 to 1.0, determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma application of
the net proceeds therefrom), as if the additional Indebtedness had been incurred or the Disqualified
Stock or preferred stock had been issued, as the case may be, at the beginning of such four quarter
period; and

(2) if such Indebtedness to be incurred is Senior Secured Indebtedness, the Company and any
Restricted Subsidiary may incur such Senior Secured Indebtedness if the Company’s Consolidated
Secured Leverage Ratio for the Company’s most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which
internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such additional
Senior Secured Indebtedness is incurred would have been less than 4.75 to 1.0, on a pro forma
basis (including a pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom).

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the incurrence of any of the following items of
Indebtedness (collectively, ‘‘Permitted Debt’’):

(1) the incurrence by the Company and any Guarantor of Indebtedness under Credit Facilities in an
aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding under this clause (1) not to exceed the
greater of (a) £50.0 million and (b) 50% of Consolidated EBITDA for the Company’s most recently
ended four fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately
preceding the date on which such Indebtedness is incurred or, if such Credit Facilities relate to
revolving credit Indebtedness, the date on which such revolving credit Indebtedness is committed,
_plus in the case of any refinancing of any Indebtedness permitted under this clause (1) or any_
portion thereof, the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs
and expenses incurred in connection with such refinancing;

(2) Indebtedness of the (x) Company or any Restricted Subsidiary outstanding on the Vue Acquisition
Completion Date or (y) Multikino and its Subsidiaries outstanding on the Multikino Acquisition

Completion Date (other than the Indebtedness described in clauses (1) or (3) of this paragraph)
after giving pro forma effect to the use of proceeds of the Notes incurred on the Issue Date;

issued on the Issue Date and the related Guarantees;

(4) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness represented by
Capital Lease Obligations, mortgage financings or purchase money obligations, in each case,
incurred for the purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price or cost of design,
construction, installation or improvement of property (real or personal), plant or equipment (whether
through the direct purchase of assets or the Capital Stock of any Person owning such assets) used
in the business of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, in an aggregate principal
amount, including all Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to renew, refund, refinance,
replace, defease or discharge any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (4), not to exceed
the greater of £25.0 million and 3.5% of Total Assets at any time outstanding;

(5) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Permitted Refinancing
Indebtedness in exchange for, or the net proceeds of which are used to renew, refund, refinance,
replace, defease or discharge any Indebtedness (other than intercompany Indebtedness) that was
permitted by the Indenture to be incurred under (a) the first paragraph of this covenant or
(b) clauses (2), (3), (5) or (16) of this paragraph;

(6) the incurrence by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of intercompany Indebtedness
between or among the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided that:

(a) if the Company or any Guarantor is the obligor on such Indebtedness and the payee is not the
Company or a Guarantor, such Indebtedness must be unsecured and expressly subordinated
to the prior payment in full in cash of all Obligations with respect to the Notes, in the case of the
Company, or the Guarantee, in the case of a Guarantor; and

(b) (i) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Equity Interests that results in any such Indebtedness
being held by a Person other than the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary and (ii) any sale or
other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person that is not either the Company or a
Restricted Subsidiary, will be deemed, in each case, to constitute an incurrence of such
Indebtedness by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, that was not
permitted by this clause (6);

(7) the issuance by any Restricted Subsidiary to the Company or to any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of
preferred stock; provided that:

(a) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Equity Interests that results in any such preferred stock
being held by a Person other than the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary; and

(b) any sale or other transfer of any such preferred stock to a Person that is not either the Company
or a Restricted Subsidiary,

will be deemed, in each case, to constitute an issuance of such preferred stock by such Restricted
Subsidiary that was not permitted by this clause (7);

(8) the incurrence by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of Hedging Obligations for bona fide
hedging purposes of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries and not for speculative
purposes;

(9) the guarantee by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of the Company or
any Restricted Subsidiary to the extent that the guaranteed Indebtedness was permitted to be
incurred by another provision of this covenant; provided that if the Indebtedness being guaranteed
is subordinated to the Notes or subordinated to or pari passu with a Guarantee, then the guarantee
must be subordinated, in the case of the Notes or subordinated or pari passu, as applicable, in the
case of a Guarantee, in each case to the same extent as the Indebtedness guaranteed;

(10) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness arising from
the honoring by a bank or other financial institution of a check, draft or similar instrument
inadvertently drawn against insufficient funds, so long as such Indebtedness is covered within five
Business Days of such incurrence;

173


-----

(11) the incurrence by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness arising from
agreements of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary providing for customary indemnification,
obligations in respect of earnouts or other adjustments of purchase price or, in each case, similar
obligations, in each case, incurred or assumed in connection with the acquisition or disposition of
any business or assets or Person or any Equity Interests of a Subsidiary; provided that the maximum
liability of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in respect of all such Indebtedness shall at
no time exceed the gross proceeds, including the Fair Market Value of non-cash proceeds
(measured at the time received and without giving effect to any subsequent changes in value),
actually received by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with such
disposition (in the case of a disposition by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries);

(12) the incurrence by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness in respect of
(a) letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances, surety, performance, completion or appeal bonds,
instruments, guarantees or other obligations, judgment, advance payment, customs, VAT or other
tax guarantees or similar instruments issued in the ordinary course of business of such Person (in
each case, (i) other than an obligation for borrowed money and (ii) to the extent such obligations are
reimbursed within 30 days of incurrence), including letters of credit or similar instruments in respect
of such obligations or in respect of self-insurance, workers compensation claims or obligations,
captive insurance companies and rent payment obligations; and (b) any customary cash
management, cash pooling or netting or setting off arrangements;

(13) Indebtedness of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in respect of Management
Advances;

that, when taken together with any Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and the
principal amount of all other Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (15) and then
outstanding, will not exceed 100% of the Net Proceeds received by the Company from the issuance
or sale (other than to a Restricted Subsidiary) of its Capital Stock (other than, in connection with the
Equity Contribution or Disqualified Stock or an Excluded Contribution) or otherwise contributed to
the equity (other than through the Equity Contribution, the issuance of Disqualified Stock or an
Excluded Contribution) of the Company or from the issuance or sale (other than to a Restricted
Subsidiary) of Subordinated Shareholder Debt, in each case, subsequent to the Vue Acquisition
Completion Date; _provided,_ _however, that (a) any such Net Proceeds that are so received or_
contributed shall be excluded for purposes of making Restricted Payments under the first
paragraph and clauses (2), (4) and (8) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under the
caption ‘‘—Restricted Payments’’ to the extent the Company or any Guarantor incur Indebtedness
in reliance thereon and (b) any Net Proceeds that are so received or contributed shall be excluded
for purposes of incurring Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (15) to the extent the Company or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries makes a Restricted Payment under the first paragraph and
clauses (2), (4) and (8) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under the caption
‘‘—Restricted Payments’’ in reliance thereon;

(16) Indebtedness of any Person outstanding on the date on which such Person becomes a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Company or is merged, consolidated, amalgamated or otherwise combined with
(including pursuant to any acquisition of assets and assumption of related liabilities) the Company
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or Indebtedness incurred in connection with the acquisition of a
Person that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, with respect to this clause (16),
that at the time of the acquisition or other transaction pursuant to which such Indebtedness was
deemed to be incurred (a) the Company would have been able to incur £1.00 of additional
Indebtedness pursuant to clause (1) of the first paragraph of this covenant, after giving pro forma
effect to the incurrence of such Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (16) or (b) the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio of the Company would not be less than it was immediately prior to giving pro forma
effect to the incurrence of such Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (16);

(17) the incurrence by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of additional Indebtedness in an
aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) at any time outstanding, including all
Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to renew, refund, refinance, replace, defease or

174


-----

discharge any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (17), not to exceed the greater of
£30.0 million and 4.0% of Total Assets; and

(18) Indebtedness incurred in any Permitted Digital Asset Financing.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the aggregate principal amount of
Indebtedness that is permitted to be Incurred by the Issuer’s Restricted Subsidiaries that are not
Guarantors pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant and clause (17) of the second paragraph of
this covenant, including all Indebtedness incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor to
redeem, refund, repay, replace, defease or discharge such Indebtedness, shall not exceed at any time
outstanding an amount equal to the greater of £30.0 million and 4.0% of Total Assets of the Company on
a pro forma basis (including a pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom).

For purposes of determining compliance with this ‘‘Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of
Preferred Stock’’ covenant, in the event that an item of Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one
of the categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses (1) through (18) above, or is entitled to be
incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Company, in its sole discretion, will be
permitted to classify such item of Indebtedness on the date of its incurrence and only be required to
include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of such clauses and will be permitted on the
date of such incurrence to divide and classify an item of Indebtedness in more than one of the types of
Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, and from time to time to
reclassify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness, in any manner that complies with this covenant;
_provided that Indebtedness incurred pursuant to clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant_
may not be reclassified. Indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility outstanding on the Issue Date
will be deemed to have been incurred on such date in reliance on the exception provided in clause (1) of
the second paragraph of this covenant. The accrual of interest or preferred stock dividends, the
accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest on any Indebtedness in the
form of additional Indebtedness, the reclassification of preferred stock as Indebtedness due to a change
in accounting principles, and the payment of dividends on preferred stock or Disqualified Stock in the
form of additional shares of the same class of preferred stock or Disqualified Stock will not be deemed to
be an incurrence of Indebtedness or an issuance of preferred stock or Disqualified Stock for purposes of
this covenant.

For purposes of determining compliance with any sterling-denominated restriction on the incurrence of
Indebtedness, the Sterling-Equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a different
currency shall be utilized, calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date
such Indebtedness was incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed, in the case of
Indebtedness incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided, however, that (i) if such Indebtedness
denominated in non-sterling currency is subject to a Currency Exchange Protection Agreement, the
amount of such Indebtedness expressed in sterling will be calculated so as to take account of the effects
of such Currency Exchange Protection Agreement; and (ii) the Sterling-Equivalent of the principal
amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the
relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date. The principal amount of any refinancing
Indebtedness incurred in the same currency as the Indebtedness being refinanced will be the SterlingEquivalent of the Indebtedness refinanced determined on the date such Indebtedness was originally
incurred, except that to the extent that:

(1) such Sterling-Equivalent was determined based on a Currency Exchange Protection Agreement, in
which case the refinancing Indebtedness will be determined in accordance with the preceding
sentence; and

(2) the principal amount of the refinancing Indebtedness exceeds the principal amount of the
Indebtedness being refinanced, in which case the Sterling-Equivalent of such excess will be
determined on the date such refinancing Indebtedness is being incurred.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be
exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in exchange rates or currency values.

The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be:

(1) in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount, the amount of the liability in
respect thereof determined in accordance with UK GAAP;

175


-----

(2) the principal amount of the Indebtedness, in the case of any other Indebtedness; and

(3) in respect of Indebtedness of another Person secured by a Lien on the assets of the specified
Person, the lesser of:

(i) the Fair Market Value of such assets at the date of determination; and

(ii) the amount of the Indebtedness of the other Person.

**_Anti-Layering_**

Neither the Company nor any Guarantor will incur any Indebtedness (including Permitted Debt) that is
contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Company or such
Guarantor unless such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes
and the applicable Guarantee on substantially identical terms; provided, however, that no Indebtedness
will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the
Company or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured with
different collateral or by virtue of being secured on a junior priority basis or by virtue of the application of
waterfall or other payment ordering provisions affecting different tranches of Indebtedness.

**_Restricted Payments_**

The Company will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or
indirectly:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or distribution on account of the
Company’s or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests (including, without limitation, any
payment in connection with any merger or consolidation involving the Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries) or to the direct or indirect holders of the Company’s or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests in their capacity as holders, other than (a) dividends or distributions
payable in Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Company and (b) dividends or
distributions payable to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary;

(2) purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for value (including, without limitation, in
connection with any merger or consolidation involving the Company) any Equity Interests of the
Company or any direct or indirect Parent Entity of the Company;

(3) make any payment on or with respect to, or purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or
retire for value any Indebtedness of the Company or any Guarantor that is contractually
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or to any Guarantee (excluding any intercompany
Indebtedness between or among the Company and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries), except (a) a
payment of interest or principal at the Stated Maturity thereof or (b) the purchase, repurchase or
other acquisition of Indebtedness purchased in anticipation of satisfying a scheduled sinking fund
obligation, principal installment or scheduled maturity, in each case due within one year of the date
of such purchase, repurchase or other acquisition;

(4) make any cash payment on or with respect to, or purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire
or retire for value any Subordinated Shareholder Debt; or

(5) make any Restricted Investment,

(all such payments and other actions set forth in these clauses (1) through (5) above being collectively
referred to as ‘‘Restricted Payments’’), unless, at the time of any such Restricted Payment:

(a) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would occur as a consequence of
such Restricted Payment;

(b) the Company would, at the time of such Restricted Payment and after giving pro forma effect thereto
as if such Restricted Payment had been made at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period,
have been permitted to incur at least £1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio test set forth in clause (1) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under the
caption ‘‘—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock’’; and

(c) such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted Payments
made by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries since the Issue Date (excluding Restricted

176


-----

Payments permitted by clauses (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (9), (10), (11), (12), (13), (14), (15), (18),
(19) and (20) of the third paragraph of this covenant) is less than the sum, without duplication, of:

(i) 50% of the Consolidated Net Income of the Company for the period (taken as one accounting
period) from the beginning of the fiscal quarter commencing immediately prior to the Issue
Date to the end of the Company’s most recently ended fiscal quarter for which internal financial
statements are available at the time of such Restricted Payment (or, if such Consolidated Net
Income for such period is a deficit, less 100% of such deficit); plus

(ii) 100% of the aggregate net cash proceeds and the Fair Market Value of property or assets or
marketable securities received by the Company since the Issue Date as a contribution to its
common equity capital or from the issue or sale of Equity Interests of the Company (other than
the Equity Contribution or Disqualified Stock and Excluded Contributions) or from the issue or
sale of convertible or exchangeable Disqualified Stock of the Company or convertible or
exchangeable debt securities of the Company, in each case that have been converted into
or exchanged for Equity Interests of the Company (other than Equity Interests and convertible
or exchangeable Disqualified Stock or debt securities sold to a Subsidiary of the Company)
or from the issuance or sale of Subordinated Shareholder Debt (other than an issuance or sale
to a Subsidiary of the Company); plus

(iii) to the extent that any Restricted Investment that was made after the Issue Date is (a) sold,
disposed of or otherwise cancelled, liquidated or repaid, 100% of the aggregate amount
received in cash and the Fair Market Value of the property or assets or marketable securities
received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than from a Person that is the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary), or (b) made in an entity that subsequently becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary, 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Restricted Investment of the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries as of the date such entity becomes a Restricted
Subsidiary; plus

(iv) to the extent that any Unrestricted Subsidiary of the Company designated as such after the
Issue Date is redesignated as a Restricted Subsidiary or is merged or consolidated into the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, or all of the assets of such Unrestricted Subsidiary are
transferred to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, the Fair Market Value of the property
received by the Company or Restricted Subsidiary or the Company’s Restricted Investment in
such Subsidiary as of the date of such redesignation, merger, consolidation or transfer of
assets, to the extent such investments reduced the Restricted Payments capacity under this
clause (iv) and were not previously repaid or otherwise reduced; plus

(v) upon the full and unconditional release of a Restricted Investment that is a guarantee made by
the Company or one of its Restricted Subsidiaries to any Person, an amount equal to the
amount of such guarantee; plus;

(vi) 100% of any cash dividends or distributions received by the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary after the Issue Date from an Unrestricted Subsidiary, to the extent that such
dividends or distributions were not otherwise included in the Consolidated Net Income of the
Company for such period,

The Fair Market Value of property or assets (other than cash covered by the preceding sentence) shall
be the Fair Market Value thereof as determined in good faith by an officer or the Board of Directors of the
Company.

The preceding provisions will not prohibit:

(1) the payment of any dividend or distribution or the consummation of any redemption within 60 days
after the date of declaration of the dividend or distribution or giving of the redemption notice, as the
case may be, if at the date of declaration or notice, the dividend, distribution or redemption payment
would have complied with the provisions of the Indenture;

(2) the making of any Restricted Payment in exchange for, or out of or with the net cash proceeds of the
substantially concurrent sale or issuance (other than to a Subsidiary of the Company) of, Equity
Interests of the Company (other than Disqualified Stock or the Equity Contribution), Subordinated
Shareholder Debt or from the substantially concurrent contribution of common equity capital to the
Company; provided that the amount of any such net cash proceeds that are utilized for any such
Restricted Payment will be excluded from the calculation of amounts under clause (c)(ii) of the

177


-----

preceding paragraph, shall not constitute Excluded Contributions, and will not be considered to be
net cash proceeds from an Equity Offering for purposes of the ‘‘Optional Redemption’’ provisions of
the Indenture;

(3) the repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement for value of
Indebtedness of the Company or any Guarantor that is contractually subordinated to the Note or to
any Guarantee in respect thereof with the net cash proceeds from an incurrence of Permitted
Refinancing Indebtedness;

(4) any Restricted Payment consisting of (or the making of any Restricted Payment to fund) the
repurchase, redemption or other acquisition or retirement for value of any Equity Interests of any
Parent Entity, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary held by any current or former officer,
director, employee or consultant of any Parent Entity, the Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries pursuant to any equity subscription agreement, stock option agreement, restricted
stock grant, shareholders’ agreement or other agreement; provided that the aggregate price paid
for all such repurchased, redeemed, acquired or retired Equity Interests may not exceed
£6.0 million in any calendar year (with unused amounts in any calendar year being carried over to
succeeding calendar years); and provided, further, that such amount in any calendar year may be
increased by an amount not to exceed (a) the cash proceeds from the sale of Equity Interests or
Subordinated Shareholder Debt of any Parent Entity, the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary
received by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary during such calendar year, in each case, to
officers, directors, employees or consultants of any Parent Entity, the Company, any of its Restricted

except (1) in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral (a) Permitted Liens, or

179


-----

(b) if such Lien is not a Permitted Lien, to the extent that all payments due under the Indenture, the Notes
and the Guarantees are secured on an equal and ratable basis (or in the case of Indebtedness which is
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or any Guarantees, prior or senior thereto, with the same
relative priority as the Notes or such Guarantee, as applicable, shall have with respect to such
subordinated Indebtedness) with the obligations so secured until such time as such obligations are no
longer secured by a Lien and (2) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted
Collateral Liens.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Company will not permit any Lien (including any Permitted Lien) to be

under the Notes and the Indenture.

**_Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Company will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or
indirectly, create or permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction on
the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(3) sell, lease or transfer any of its properties or assets to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary,

(including the application of any standstill period to) loans or advances made to the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness incurred by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, in
each case, shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

reason of:

(1) agreements of (a) the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries as in effect on the Vue Acquisition
Completion Date or (b) Multikino and its Subsidiaries as in effect on the Multikino Acquisition
Completion Date and any amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements,
refundings, replacements or refinancings of those agreements; provided that the amendments,
restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings are
not materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, with respect to such dividend and other payment
restrictions than those contained in those agreements on the Vue Acquisition Completion Date or
Multikino Acquisition Completion Date, as the case may be;

(2) the Indenture, the Notes, the Guarantees, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and

the covenant described under ‘‘—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock’’ if
the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a
whole are not materially less favorable to the holders of the Notes than (a) the encumbrances and
restrictions contained in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement, the
Indenture and the Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement, in each case, as in effect on the Issue
Date (as determined in good faith by the Company) or (b) is customary in comparable financings
(as determined in good faith by the Company);

(4) applicable law, rule, regulation or order or the terms of any license, authorization, concession or
permit;

(5) any instrument governing Indebtedness or Capital Stock of a Person acquired by the Company or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries as in effect at the time of such acquisition (except to the extent
such Indebtedness or Capital Stock was incurred in connection with or in contemplation of such
acquisition), which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or

180

Indenture to be incurred;

the ordinary course of business;

(7) purchase money obligations and Capital Lease Obligations that impose restrictions on the property
purchased or leased of the nature described in clause (3) of the preceding paragraph;

(8) any agreement for the sale or other disposition of the Capital Stock or all or substantially all of the
property and assets of a Restricted Subsidiary that restricts distributions by that Restricted
Subsidiary pending its sale or other disposition;

(9) Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness; _provided that the restrictions contained in the agreements_
governing such Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness are not materially more restrictive, taken as a
whole, than those contained in comparable financings at the time of determination (as determined
in good faith by the Company) and would not otherwise restrict the payment of amounts due in
respect of the Notes, a Guarantee, or compliance by the Company or any Guarantor with its
obligations under the Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, the Security Documents or any Credit Facility;

(10) Liens permitted to be incurred under the provisions of the covenant described under the caption
‘‘—Liens’’ that limit the right of the debtor to dispose of the assets subject to such Liens;

(11) customary provisions limiting the disposition or distribution of assets or property in joint venture
agreements, asset sale agreements, sale-leaseback agreements, stock sale agreements and other
similar agreements in the ordinary course of business (including agreements entered into in
connection with a Restricted Investment), which limitation is applicable only to the assets that are
the subject of such agreements;

(12) restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers or suppliers or required
by insurance, surety or bonding companies, in each case, under contracts entered into in the
ordinary course of business;

(13) any encumbrance or restriction existing under any agreement that extends, renews, refinances or
replaces the agreements containing the encumbrances or restrictions in the foregoing clauses (1)
through (12), or in this clause (13); _provided that the terms and conditions of any such_
encumbrances or restrictions are no more restrictive in any material respect than those under or
pursuant to the agreement so extended, renewed, refinanced or replaced; and

(14) any mortgage financing or mortgage refinancing that imposes restrictions only on the real property
securing such Indebtedness.

**_Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets_**

Intercreditor Agreement, if any, pursuant to the terms thereof;

(3) immediately after such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists; and

181


-----

(4) the Company or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than

has been made would, on the date of such transaction after giving pro forma effect thereto and any
related financing transactions as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable
four-quarter period (a) be permitted to incur at least £1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to
the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in the first paragraph of the covenant described
under the caption ‘‘—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock’’ or (b) have a
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio no less than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such
transaction.

A Guarantor (other than any Guarantor whose Guarantee is to be released in accordance with the terms
of the Indenture) will not, directly or indirectly: (1) consolidate or merge with or into another Person
(whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving corporation), or (2) sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or
otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of such Guarantor and its
Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one or more related transactions, to
another Person, unless:

(1) immediately after giving effect to that transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists;

(2) either:

(a) the Person acquiring the property in any such sale or disposition or the Person formed by or
surviving any such consolidation or merger assumes all the obligations of that Guarantor under

Village Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, if any, on terms
satisfactory to the Trustee; or

(b) the Net Proceeds of such sale or other disposition are applied in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Indenture.

In addition, the Company will not, directly or indirectly, lease all or substantially all of the properties and
assets of it and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one or more related transactions, to any
other Person.

Clauses (3) and (4) of the first paragraph of this ‘‘Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets’’ covenant will
not apply to any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets or merger or consolidation
of the Company with or into any Guarantor and clause (4) of the first paragraph of this ‘‘Merger,
Consolidation or Sale of Assets’’ covenant will not apply to any sale or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the assets or merger or consolidation of the Company with or into an Affiliate solely for
the purpose of reincorporating the Company in another jurisdiction for tax reasons.

**_Transactions with Affiliates_**

The Company will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any
payment to or sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase
any property or assets from, or enter into or make or amend any transaction, contract, agreement,
understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of the Company (each,
an ‘‘Affiliate Transaction’’) involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of £5.0 million,
unless:

(1) the Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are no less favorable to the Company or the relevant
Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary with a Person who is not an Affiliate; and

(2) the Company delivers to the Trustee:

(a) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving
aggregate consideration in excess of £15.0 million, a resolution of the Board of Directors of the
Company set forth in an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such Affiliate Transaction complies
with this covenant and that such Affiliate Transaction has been approved by a majority of the
Disinterested Directors; and, in addition;

(b) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving
aggregate consideration in excess of £50.0 million, an opinion of an accounting, appraisal or
investment banking firm of international standing, or other recognized independent expert of

182


-----

international standing with experience in appraising the terms and conditions of the type of
transaction or series of related transactions for which an opinion is required, stating that the
transaction or series of related transactions is (i) fair from a financial point of view taking into
account all relevant circumstances or (ii) on terms not less favorable than might have been
obtained in a comparable transaction at such time on an arm’s length basis from a Person who
is not an Affiliate.

The following items will not be deemed to be Affiliate Transactions and, therefore, will not be subject to
the provisions of the prior paragraph:

(1) any employment agreement, collective bargaining agreement, consultant, employee benefit

(15) of the definition thereof);

Subsidiaries as in effect on the Vue Acquisition Completion Date or (b) Multikino and its Subsidiaries
as in effect on the Multikino Acquisition Completion Date and transactions pursuant to any
amendment, modification or extension to such agreement, so long as such amendment,
modification or extension, taken as a whole, is not more disadvantageous to the holders of the
Notes in any material respect than the original agreement as in effect on the Vue Acquisition
Completion Date or Multikino Acquisition Completion Date, as the case may be;

(11) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers, or purchasers or sellers of goods or services or
providers of employees or other labor, in each case in the ordinary course of business and
otherwise in compliance with the terms of the Indenture that are fair to the Company or the
Restricted Subsidiaries, in the reasonable determination of the members of the Board of Directors of
the Company or the senior management thereof, or are on terms at least as favorable as might
reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated Person;

(12) any payments or other transactions pursuant to a tax sharing agreement between the Company and
any other Person or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company and any other Person with which the
Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries files a consolidated tax return or with which the
Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is part of a group for tax purposes or any tax
advantageous group contribution made pursuant to applicable legislation; provided, however, that
any such tax sharing or arrangement and payment does not permit or require payments in excess of
the amounts of tax that would be payable by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a
stand- alone basis;

(13) any contribution to the capital of the Company in exchange for Capital Stock of the Company (other

be, on any matter involving such other Person;

(16) any Affiliate Transaction, to the extent described in the Offering Memorandum, entered into in
connection with the Transactions as defined under the caption ‘‘The Transactions’’ in this Offering
Memorandum (including, without limitation, (i) any recharge of transaction costs incurred by
OMERS Private Equity Inc. and Alberta Investment Management Corporation to the Company in
connection with the Transactions and (ii) a one-time transaction fee payable to some of the Equity
Investors for advisory services rendered in connection with the Transactions in an amount not to
exceed 1.0% of the aggregate net proceeds contributed as Equity Interests (other than Disqualified
Stock) or Subordinated Shareholder Debt of the Company in connection with such Transaction for
which the fees relate).

**_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

The Board of Directors of the Company may designate any Restricted Subsidiary (including any newly
acquired or newly formed Restricted Subsidiary) to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation
would not cause a Default. If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the
aggregate Fair Market Value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an
Investment made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted
Payments under the covenant described under the caption ‘‘—Restricted Payments’’ or under one or
more clauses of the definition of Permitted Investments, as determined by the Company. That
designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted
Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. The Company may redesignate
any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if that redesignation would not cause a Default.

Any designation of a Subsidiary of the Company as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to the
Trustee by filing with the Trustee a copy of a resolution of the Board of Directors giving effect to such
designation and an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complied with the preceding
conditions and was permitted by the covenant described under the caption ‘‘—Restricted Payments.’’ If,
at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the requirements as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture and any
Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such
date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be incurred as of such date under the covenant
described under the caption ‘‘—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock,’’ the
Company will be in default of such covenant. The Board of Directors of the Company may at any time
designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such designation will
be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding
Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will only be permitted if (1) such
Indebtedness is permitted under the covenant described under the caption ‘‘—Incurrence of
Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock,’’ calculated on a pro forma basis as if such designation
had occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period; and (2) no Default or Event of Default
would be in existence following such designation.

**_Maintenance of Listing_**

The Company will use its reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain the listing of the Notes on the Official
List of the Irish Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Global Exchange Market thereof for so
long as such Notes are outstanding; provided that if the Company is unable to obtain admission to listing
of the Notes on the Irish Stock Exchange or if at any time the Company determines that it will not so list or
maintain such listing, it will use its reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain a listing of such Notes on
another ‘‘recognised stock exchange’’ as defined in Section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007 of the
United Kingdom.

184

**_Limitation on Issuances of Guarantees of Indebtedness_**

The Company will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is not a Guarantor, directly or
indirectly, to guarantee the payment of any other Indebtedness of the Company or any Guarantor unless
such Restricted Subsidiary simultaneously executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental
Indenture to the Indenture providing for the guarantee of the payment of the Notes by such Restricted
Subsidiary, which Guarantee will be pari passu with or senior to such Restricted Subsidiary’s guarantee
of such other Indebtedness.

Each additional Guarantee will be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available
to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference,
financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses
affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not be applicable to (1) any Guarantee of Indebtedness (other
than the Revolving Credit Facility) (a) of Vue and its Subsidiaries existing on the Issue Date or (b) of
Multikino and its Subsidiaries existing on the Issue Date; or (2) given to a bank or trust company having
combined capital and surplus and undivided profits of not less than £250 million, whose debt has a
rating, at the time such guarantee was given, of at least ‘‘A’’ or the equivalent thereof by S&P and at least
‘‘A2’’ or the equivalent thereof by Moody’s, in connection with the operation of cash management
programs established for the benefit of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to cause such Restricted Subsidiary
to guarantee the payment of the Notes to the extent that such Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary
would reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in:

(1) a violation of applicable law, which, in any case, cannot be prevented or otherwise avoided through
measures reasonably available to the Company or the Restricted Subsidiary; or

(2) any liability for the officers, directors or shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary,

_provided that the Company will procure that the relevant Restricted Subsidiary becomes a Guarantor at_
such time as such restrictions or liabilities above would no longer apply to the provision of the Guarantee
or no longer would prohibit such Restricted Subsidiary from becoming a Guarantor (or prevent the
Company from causing such Restricted Subsidiary to become a Guarantor).

**_Post-Closing Guarantors and Post-Closing Collateral_**

_Initial Vue Guarantors_

The Company will cause the Initial Vue Guarantors to become Guarantors by executing and delivering to
the Trustee a supplemental indenture pursuant to which the Initial Vue Guarantors will provide a
Guarantee no later than the earlier of (1) the date on which such entity becomes a guarantor under the
Revolving Credit Facility and (2) two Business Days (or 15 Business Days in the case of Aurora Cinema
(Ireland) Limited) following the Vue Acquisition Completion Date; provided that the Guarantee provided
by the Initial Vue Guarantors will be limited as set forth in the Indenture.

The Company will cause the relevant Initial Vue Guarantors to ensure that a Lien over the Vue
Post-Closing Collateral is granted to the Security Agent on behalf of, and for the benefit of, the Holders
pursuant to Security Documents, creating a valid and effective Lien over such Vue Post-Closing
Collateral on the date such Initial Vue Guarantor accedes to the Indenture and becomes a Guarantor.

_Multikino Guarantors_

The Company will cause the Multikino Guarantors to become Guarantors by executing and delivering to
the Trustee a supplemental indenture pursuant to which the Multikino Guarantors will provide a
Guarantee no later than the earlier of (1) the date on which such entity becomes a guarantor under the
Revolving Credit Facility and (2) 30 Business Days following the later of (a) the Multikino Acquisition
Completion Date and (b) the Vue Acquisition Completion Date; provided that the Guarantee provided by
the Multikino Guarantors will be limited so that, among other things, it expressly provides that prior to the
Transformation (as defined below) such Guarantee will not extend to that portion of the Notes the
proceeds of which were used to fund the Multikino Acquisition.

The Company will cause the relevant Multikino Guarantors to ensure that a Lien over the Multikino
Post-Closing Collateral is granted to the Security Agent on behalf of, and for the benefit of, the Holders

185


-----

pursuant to Security Documents, creating a valid and effective Lien over such Multikino Post-Closing
Collateral on the date such Multikino Guarantor accedes to the Indenture and becomes a Guarantor;
_provided that the Liens provided by the Multikino Guarantors will be limited so that, among other things,_
it expressly provides that prior to the Transformation such Lien will not secure that portion of the Notes
the proceeds of which were used to fund the Multikino Acquisition.

The Company will cause, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Multikino Acquisition Completion
Date, and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause within nine months after the Multikino Acquisition
Completion Date, Multikino S.A. to change its corporate form from a joint stock company (S.A.) to a
limited liability company (sp. z o.o.) (the ‘‘Transformation’’).

Promptly after the completion of the Transformation, and in no event later than 30 Business Days after
the date of the Transformation, the Company will cause the Multikino Guarantors to provide an additional
Guarantee or extend the Guarantee previously provided and grant additional Liens over the Multikino
Post-Closing Collateral or extend the Liens previously granted over the Multikino Post-Closing Collateral
(in each case, as requested by the Security Agent and the Trustee), to cover all obligations outstanding
under the Notes and the Indenture (subject to other limitations as set forth in the Indenture).

_CinemaxX Guarantors_

The Company will, and will cause its Restricted Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to:

(1) complete the Squeeze Out as promptly as reasonably practicable following the Issue Date; and

(2) complete the German Company Conversion as soon as reasonably practicable after the completion
of the Squeeze Out; or

(3) to the extent legally possible and reasonably achievable, otherwise implement a Structure Event.

Within the earlier of (1) the date on which such entity becomes a guarantor under the Revolving Credit
Facility and (2) 20 Business Days following the occurrence of a Structure Event, the Company will cause
the CinemaxX Guarantors to become Guarantors by executing and delivering to the Trustee a
supplemental indenture pursuant to which the CinemaxX Guarantors will provide a Guarantee; provided
that the Guarantee provided by the CinemaxX Guarantors will be limited as set forth in the Indenture. For
the avoidance of doubt, if the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries have used reasonable best
efforts to complete the Squeeze Out and the Germany Company Conversion, there shall be no Default in
the event such transactions are not implemented by a certain date, if at all.

Each of the Company and the Guarantors will, and the Company will cause its Subsidiaries to, use
reasonable best efforts so that a Lien over the CinemaxX Post-Closing Collateral is granted to the
Security Agent on behalf of, and for the benefit of, the Holders pursuant to Security Documents, creating
an effective security interest over such CinemaxX Post-Closing Collateral no later than the earlier of
(1) the date on which the Revolving Credit Facility is secured by the CinemaxX Post-Closing Collateral
and (2) 20 Business Days following the occurrence of a Structure Event; provided that each Lien over the
CinemaxX Post-Closing Collateral will be limited as set forth in the agreed form of the Security
Documents at the Issue Date; provided, further, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall
not be obligated to cause any CinemaxX Post-Closing Collateral to secure the Notes to the extent that
such the grant of such security would reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in a violation of
applicable law, regulation or order of a regulator which, in any case, cannot be prevented or otherwise
avoided through measures reasonably available to the Company or the relevant pledgor or any liability
for the officers, directors or shareholders of the relevant pledgor or pledgee.

**_Payments for Consent_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, pay
or cause to be paid any consideration to or for the benefit of any holder of the Notes for or as an
inducement to any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms of the provisions of the Indenture
or the Notes unless such consideration is offered to be paid and is paid to all holders of the Notes that
consent, waive or agree to amend in the time frame set forth in the solicitation documents relating to
such consent, waiver or agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries shall be permitted, in any offer or payment of consideration for, or as an inducement to, any
consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of the Indenture or the Notes, to exclude
holders of Notes in any jurisdiction where (1) the solicitation of such consent, waiver or amendment,

186


-----

including in connection with an offer to purchase for cash, or (2) the payment of the consideration
therefor would require the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to file a registration statement,
prospectus or similar document under any applicable securities laws (including, but not limited to, the
United States federal securities laws and the laws of the European Union or its member states), which
the Company in its sole discretion determines (acting in good faith) (a) would be materially burdensome
(it being understood that it would not be materially burdensome to file the consent document(s) used in
other jurisdictions, any substantially similar documents or any summary thereof with the securities or
financial services authorities in such jurisdiction); or (b) such solicitation would otherwise not be
permitted under applicable law in such jurisdiction.

**_No Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Company will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, take or
knowingly or negligently omit to take, any action which action or omission would have the result of
materially impairing the security interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood that the
incurrence of Liens on the Collateral permitted by the definition of Permitted Collateral Liens shall under
no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the security interest with respect to the Collateral), or
prior to the Escrow Release, the Escrowed Property, for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of
Notes and the Company will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, grant
to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of Notes and
the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and the
Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral, or prior to the
Escrow Release, the Escrowed Property except as described in the Escrow Agreement; provided that
(a) nothing in this provision shall restrict the discharge or release of the Collateral in accordance with the
Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Warner Village Intercreditor
Agreement and (b) the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur Permitted Collateral Liens;
and _provided further,_ _however, that no Security Document may be amended, extended, renewed,_
restated, supplemented or otherwise modified, replaced, or released (followed by an immediate retaking
of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets) unless contemporaneously with such
amendment, extension, replacement, restatement, supplement, modification, renewal or release
(followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the assets), the Company
delivers to the Trustee one of the following:

(1) a solvency opinion from an internationally recognized investment bank or accounting firm, in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee confirming the solvency of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment,
extension, restatement, renewal, supplement, modification, replacement or release and retaking;

(2) a certificate from the board of directors or chief financial officer of the relevant Person (acting in
good faith) that confirms the solvency of the Person granting such Lien after giving effect to any
transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, replacement,
supplement, modification or release and retaking; or

(3) an opinion of counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee (subject to
customary exceptions and qualifications), confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions
related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification,
replacement or release and retaking, the Lien or Liens securing the Notes created under the
Security Documents so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified, replaced
or released and retaken are valid and perfected Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation
imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, and that such Lien or Liens were not
otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, modification, replacement or release and retaking.

At the direction of the Company and without the consent of the holders of Notes, the Security Agent may
from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the Security Documents to: (i) cure any
ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency therein, (ii) (but subject to compliance with the first
paragraph of this covenant) provide for Permitted Collateral Liens, (iii) add to the Collateral or (iv) make
any other change thereto that does not adversely affect the rights of the holders of Notes in any material
respect.

In the event that the Company complies with this covenant, the Trustee and/or the Security Agent, as
applicable, shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement or release with no need for
instructions from the holders of the Notes.

187


-----

**_Further Assurances_**

The Company will, and will procure that each of its Subsidiaries will at its own expense, execute such
documents and provide such assurances as the Security Agent may reasonably require (1) for
registering any Security Documents in any required register and for perfecting or protecting the security
intended to be afforded by such Security Documents and (2) if such Security Documents have become
enforceable, for facilitating the realization of all or any part of the assets which are subject to such
Security Documents and for facilitating the exercise of all powers, authorities and discretions vested in
the Security Agent or in any receiver of all or any part of those assets. The Company will, and will procure
that each of its Subsidiaries will execute all transfers, conveyances, assignments and releases of that
property whether to the Security Agent or to its nominees and give all notices, orders and directions
which the Security Agent may reasonably request.

**_Suspension of Covenants When Notes Rated Investment Grade_**

If on any date following the Issue Date:

(1) the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status; and

(2) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on such date,

then, the Company will notify the Trustee and beginning on that day and continuing until such time, if
any, at which the Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status (such period, the ‘‘Suspension Period’’),
the covenants specifically listed under the following captions in this Offering Memorandum will no longer
be applicable to the Notes and any related default provisions of the Indenture will cease to be effective
and will not be applicable to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries:

(1) ‘‘—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales’’;

(2) ‘‘—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock’’;

(3) ‘‘—Restricted Payments’’;

(4) ‘‘—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries’’;

(5) clause (4) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under ‘‘—Merger, Consolidation or Sale
of Assets’’;

(6) ‘‘—Transactions with Affiliates’’; and

(7) ‘‘—Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries.’’

Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to the actions of the Company and the
Restricted Subsidiaries properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension Period; provided that
(1) with respect to the Restricted Payments made after any such reinstatement, the amount of Restricted
Payments will be calculated as though the covenant described under the caption ‘‘—Restricted
Payments’’ had been in effect prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period and (2) all Indebtedness
incurred, or Disqualified Stock or preferred stock issued, during the Suspension Period will be classified
to have been incurred or issued pursuant to clause (3) of the second paragraph of the caption
‘‘—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock.’’ Upon the occurrence of a Suspension
Period, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

The Company shall notify the Trustee upon the occurrence of a Suspension Period; provided that such
notice will not be a precondition of the suspension of covenants described under this caption.

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Status.

**Reports**

So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Company will furnish to the Trustee:

(1) within 120 days after the end of the Company’s fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year ending
November 28, 2013, annual reports containing the following information with a level of detail that is
substantially comparable and similar in scope to this Offering Memorandum: (a) an audited

individually or in the aggregate when considered with all other acquisition or dispositions that have
occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year as to which such annual
report relates, represent greater than 20% of the Company’s EBITDA on a _pro forma basis) or_
recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year
as to which such annual report relates (unless such pro forma information has been provided in a
previous report pursuant to clause (2) or (3) below, in each case unless pro forma information has
been provided in a previous report pursuant to clause (2) or (3) below); (c) an operating and
financial review of the audited financial statements, including a discussion of the results of
operations (including a discussion of the number of screens, total admissions, average ticket price,

each of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the Company beginning with the fiscal
quarter ending August 29, 2013, quarterly reports containing the following information: (a) an
unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of the end of such quarter and unaudited
condensed statements of income and cash flow for the quarterly and year to date periods ending on
the unaudited condensed balance sheet date, and the comparable prior year periods for the
Company, together with condensed note disclosure; (b) pro forma income statement and balance

considered with all other acquisitions or dispositions that have occurred since the beginning of the
most recently completed fiscal quarter as to which such quarterly report relates, represent greater
than 20% of the Company’s EBITDA on a pro forma basis) or recapitalizations that have occurred
since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal quarter as to which such quarterly report
relates, in each case unless pro forma information has been provided in a previous report pursuant
to clause (1), (2) or (3) of this covenant; (c) an operating and financial review of the unaudited
financial statements (including a discussion of the number of screens, total admissions, average

between the current year to date period and the corresponding period of the prior year; and (d) risk
factors and recent developments as are customary for such reports; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of (a) a material acquisition, disposition or restructuring (including
any acquisition or disposition that would require the delivery of _pro forma financial information_
pursuant to clause (1) or (2) above); (b) any senior management change at the Company; (c) any
change in the auditors of the Company; (d) the entering into an agreement that will result in a

_provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above will not be required to_
(i) contain any reconciliation to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or (ii) include separate
financial statements for any Guarantors or non-guarantor Subsidiaries of the Company.

If the Company has designated any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries and such
Subsidiaries are Significant Subsidiaries, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by
the preceding paragraph will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the
financial statements or in the notes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations
of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Company.

189


-----

All financial statements shall be prepared in accordance with UK GAAP. Except as provided for above, no
report need include separate financial statements for the Company or Subsidiaries of the Company or
any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure not
of a type included in this Offering Memorandum.

The Company will, either (1) within ten Business Days after the delivery of each report discussed in
clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, conduct a conference call to discuss such
report and answer questions about such report, which conference call will be open to all Noteholders or
(ii) provide holders of the Notes with access to and the opportunity to participate in any public
conference call, investor presentation, webcast or other event, the primary purpose of which is to
discuss results of operations or any material event referenced in clause (3) of the first paragraph of this
covenant with investors in the Capital Stock of the Company. Details of such conference calls will either
(a) be delivered with each report or (b) posted on an electronic website that is used by the Company to
communicate to the equity holders generally for which the Noteholders have been, prior to the posting of
such notice, informed of the website address and relevant password specifications, which notice shall
constitute reasonable notice of such public calls for the purpose of this paragraph.

In addition, for so long as any Notes remain outstanding and during any period during which the
Company is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the U.S. Exchange Act nor exempt therefrom pursuant
to Rule 12g3-2(b), the Company has agreed that it will furnish to the holders of the Notes and to
securities analysts and prospective investors, upon their request, the information required to be
delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the U.S. Securities Act.

Contemporaneously with the furnishing of each such report discussed above, the Company will also
make available copies of all reports required by clauses (1) through (3) of the first paragraph of the
covenant (1) on the Company’s website and (2) if and so long as the Notes are listed on the Irish Stock
Exchange and the rules of the Irish Stock Exchange so require, at the specified office of the Paying Agent
in London.

**Events of Default and Remedies**

Each of the following is an ‘‘Event of Default’’:

(1) default for 30 days in the payment when due of interest or Additional Amounts, if any, with respect to
the Notes;

(2) default in the payment when due (at maturity, upon redemption or otherwise) of the principal of, or
premium, if any, on, the Notes;

(3) failure by the Company or any Guarantor to comply with the provisions described under the caption
‘‘—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets’’;

(4) failure by the Company or any Guarantor for 60 days after written notice to the Company by the
Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding
voting as a single class to comply with any of the agreements in the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement or any of the Security Documents (other
than a default in performance, or breach, or a covenant or agreement which is specifically dealt with
in clauses (1), (2) or (3));

(5) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which
there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company, any
Guarantor or any Significant Subsidiary (or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Company,
any Guarantor or any Significant Subsidiaries), whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now
exists, or is created after the Issue Date, if that default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on, such Indebtedness at
the Stated Maturity thereof prior to the expiration of the grace period provided in such
Indebtedness on the date of such default (a ‘‘Payment Default’’); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its express maturity,

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal
amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a Payment Default or the
maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates £20.0 million or more;

190


-----

(6) failure by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary, to pay final judgments entered by a court or
courts of competent jurisdiction aggregating in excess of £20.0 million (exclusive of any amounts
that a solvent insurance company has agreed in writing to pay under applicable policies), which
judgments shall not have been discharged or waived and there shall have been a period of 60
consecutive days during which a stay of enforcement of such judgment or order, by reason of an
appeal, waiver or otherwise, shall not have been in effect;

(7) (a) any security interest created by the Security Documents with respect to Collateral having a Fair
Market Value in excess of £10.0 million ceases to be in full force and effect (except as permitted by
the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or
the Security Documents), or an assertion by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that
any Collateral having a Fair Market Value in excess of £10.0 million is not subject to a valid, perfected
security interest (except as permitted by the terms of the Indenture, the Security Documents, the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement); or (b) the repudiation by the Company of any of its material obligations under the
Security Documents;

(8) except as permitted by the Indenture, if any Guarantee is held in any judicial proceeding to be
unenforceable or invalid or ceases for any reason to be in full force and effect, or any Guarantor, or
any Person acting on behalf of any Guarantor, denies or disaffirms its obligations under its
Guarantee and such Default continues for 20 days;

(9) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency described in the Indenture with respect to the Company
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of its Restricted
Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary; and

(10) failure by the Company to comply with any material term of the Escrow Agreement that is not cured
within 10 days and to consummate either the Vue Mandatory Redemption or the Multikino
Mandatory Redemption as described under the captions ‘‘—Escrow Proceeds; Special Mandatory
Redemption.’’

**_Remedies under the Indenture_**

In the case of an Event of Default specified in clause (9) above, all outstanding Notes will become due
and payable immediately without further action or notice. If any other Event of Default occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes may and, if directed by holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the
then outstanding Notes, the Trustee shall, declare all the Notes to be due and payable immediately.

Subject to certain limitations, holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding
Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from holders
of the Notes notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default if it determines that withholding notice is
in their interest, except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of principal, interest or
Additional Amounts or premium, if any.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, in case an Event of Default
occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers
under the Indenture at the request or direction of any holders of Notes unless such holders have offered
to the Trustee, and the Trustee has received, indemnity and/or security satisfactory to it against any loss,
liability or expense. Except (subject to the provisions described under ‘‘—Amendment, Supplement and
Waiver’’) to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest or Additional
Amounts when due, no holder of a Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the
Notes unless:

(1) such holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have requested
the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such holders have offered the Trustee, and the Trustee has received, security and/or indemnity
satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense;

191


-----

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and
the offer of security and/or indemnity; and

(5) holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have not given the
Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

The holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding may, on
behalf of the holders of all outstanding Notes, waive any past default under the Indenture and its
consequences, except a continuing default in the payment of the principal of premium, if any, any
Additional Amounts or interest on any Note held by a non-consenting holder (which may only be waived
with the consent of each holder of the Notes affected).

The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the
Indenture.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Company or any Guarantor, as such,
will have any liability for any obligations of the Company and the Guarantors under the Notes, the
Indenture, the Guarantees or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or
their creation. Each holder of the Notes by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The
waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. The waiver may not be
effective to waive liabilities under applicable securities laws.

**Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

The Company may at any time, at the option of its Board of Directors evidenced by a resolution set forth
in an Officer’s Certificate elect to have all of its obligations discharged with respect to the outstanding
Notes and all obligations of the Guarantors discharged with respect to their Guarantees (‘‘Legal
_Defeasance’’) except for:_

(1) the rights of holders of outstanding Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, or
interest (including Additional Amounts) or premium, if any, on, such Notes when such payments are
due from the trust referred to below;

(2) the Company’s obligations with respect to the Notes concerning issuing temporary Notes,
registration of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or
agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust;

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Company’s and the
Guarantors’ obligations in connection therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

In addition, the Company may, at its option and at any time elect to have the obligations of the Company
and the Guarantors released with respect to certain covenants (including its obligation to make Change
of Control Offers and Asset Sale Offers) that are described in the Indenture (‘‘Covenant Defeasance’’)
and thereafter any omission to comply with those covenants will not constitute a Default or Event of
Default with respect to the Notes. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, all Events of Default
described under ‘‘—Events of Default and Remedies’’ (except those relating to payments on the Notes
or, solely with respect to the Company, bankruptcy or insolvency events) will no longer constitute an
Event of Default with respect to the Notes.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:

(1) the Company must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee (or such other entity designated by the
Trustee for this purpose), in trust, for the benefit of the holders of the Notes, cash in sterling,
non-callable U.K. Government Securities or a combination of cash in sterling and non-callable U.K.
Government Securities (in the case of the Fixed Rate Notes) and cash in euros, non-callable euro
denominated European Government Obligations or a combination of cash in euro and non-callable
European Government Obligations (in the case of the Floating Rate Note), in each case, in amounts
as will be sufficient, in the opinion of an internationally recognized investment bank, appraisal firm or
firm of independent public accountants, to pay the principal of, or interest (including Additional
Amounts and premium, if any) on the outstanding Notes on the stated date for payment thereof or

192


-----

on the applicable redemption date, as the case may be, and the Company must specify whether the
Notes are being defeased to such stated date for payment or to a particular redemption date;

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Company must deliver to the Trustee an opinion reasonably
acceptable to the Trustee of U.S. independent counsel confirming that (a) the Company has
received from, or there has been published by, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service a ruling or
(b) since the Issue Date, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in
either case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion of counsel will confirm that, the
holders of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax
purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the
same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such
Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Company must deliver to the Trustee an opinion
reasonably acceptable to the Trustee of U.S. independent counsel confirming that the holders of the
outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a
result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same
amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant
Defeasance had not occurred;

(4) the Company must deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not
made by the Company with the intent of preferring the holders of Notes over the other creditors of
the Company with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any creditors of the
Company or others; and

(5) the Company must deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an opinion of counsel, subject
to customary assumptions and qualifications, each stating that all conditions precedent relating to
the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance have been complied with.

**Amendment, Supplement and Waiver**

Except as provided otherwise in the succeeding paragraphs, the Indenture, the Notes, the Guarantees,
the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement and
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the
holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including,
without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer
for, Notes), and any existing Default or Event of Default or compliance with any provision of the
Indenture, the Notes, the Guarantees, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Warner
Village Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement may be waived with the
consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes
(including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or
exchange offer for, Notes).

Unless (i) consented to by the holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes or (ii) consented to by each holder of the Notes adversely affected thereby (in each
case including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or
exchange offer for, Notes), an amendment, supplement or waiver may not:

(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose holders must consent to an amendment, supplement
or waiver;

(2) reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any Note or alter the provisions with respect to
the redemption of the Notes (other than provisions relating to the covenants described under the
caption ‘‘—Repurchase at the Option of Holders’’);

(3) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest, including default interest, on any Note;

(4) impair the right of any holder of the Notes to receive payment of principal of and interest on such
holder’s Notes on or after the due dates therefore or to institute suit for the enforcement of any
payment on or with respect to such holder’s Notes or any Guarantee in respect thereof;

(5) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of, or interest, Additional Amounts or
premium, if any, on, the Notes (except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the holders of at

193


-----

least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes and a waiver of the
Payment Default that resulted from such acceleration);

(6) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Notes;

(7) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or the rights
of holders of Notes to receive payments of principal of, or interest, Additional Amounts or premium,
if any, on, the Notes;

(8) waive a redemption payment with respect to any Note (other than a payment required by one of the
covenants described under the caption ‘‘—Repurchase at the Option of Holders’’);

(9) change the ranking of the Notes or any Guarantees;

(10) release any Collateral granted for the benefit of the holders of Notes, except in accordance with the
terms of the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement;

(11) release any Guarantor from any of its Obligations under its Guarantee or the Indenture, except in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture;

(12) make any change in the preceding amendment and waiver provisions; or

(13) waive or modify any provision of the Escrow Agreement (including, without limitation, those relating
to the release of the Escrowed Property), to the extent such provisions relate to the Company’s
obligation to redeem the Notes in a Special Mandatory Redemption, that adversely affects the right
of any Holder of such Notes in any material respect.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any amendment, waiver or other modification affects only the rights of
the Fixed Rate Notes or the Floating Rate Notes, as applicable, the Holders of the other series of Notes
shall not be required to consent thereto (and in such case, only the consent of a majority or 90%, as the
case may be, in aggregate principal amount of the affected series of Notes shall be required to consent
thereto). For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed that any matter described in the
preceding paragraphs that by its terms applies only to the Fixed Rate Notes or the Floating Rate Notes
shall not be deemed to affect the rights of, or require the consent of, the Holders of the other series of
Notes and shall require only the consent of 90% of the Holders of the Fixed Rate Notes or the Floating
Rate Notes, as the case may be.

Notwithstanding the preceding, without the consent of any holder of the Notes, the Company, the
Trustee, the Security Agent (as applicable and to the extent each is a party to the relevant document)
may amend or supplement the Indenture, the Notes, the Guarantee, the Security Documents, the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency;

(2) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes (provided, however,
that the uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the U.S.
Internal Revenue Code);

(3) to provide for the assumption of the Company’s or a Guarantor’s obligations to holders of Notes and
Guarantees in the case of a merger or consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the
Company’s or such Guarantor’s assets, as applicable;

(4) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the holders of Notes or
that does not adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture of any such holder in any material
respect;

(5) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Notes or the Guarantees to any
provision of this ‘‘Description of the Notes’’ to the extent that such provision in this ‘‘Description of
the Notes’’ was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Security
Documents, the Notes or the Guarantees;

(6) to enter into additional or supplemental Security Documents;

(7) to release any Guarantee in accordance with the terms of the Indenture;

(8) to release the Collateral in accordance with the terms of the Indenture;

194

(9) to provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with the limitations set forth in the
Indenture as of the Issue Date;

(10) to allow any Guarantor to execute a supplemental indenture and/or a Guarantee with respect to the
Notes; or

(11) to evidence and provide the acceptance of the appointment of a successor Trustee or the Security
Agent under the Indenture or the evidence and provide the acceptance of the appointment of a
Security Agent under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or any
Security Document.

The consent of the holders of Notes is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form
of any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed
amendment.

In formulating its opinion on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to rely absolutely on such
evidence as it deems appropriate, including an opinion of counsel and an Officer’s Certificate.

**Additional or Amended Intercreditor Agreement**

At the request of the Company, at the time of, or prior to, the incurrence of any Indebtedness that is
permitted to share the Collateral or that is otherwise permitted to be incurred under the Indenture, the
Company and the Security Agent will (without the consent of holders of the Notes) enter into an
additional intercreditor agreement (each an ‘‘Additional Intercreditor Agreement’’) on terms substantially
similar to the Intercreditor Agreement (or on terms more favorable to the holders of the Notes) or an
amendment to or an amendment and restatement of the Intercreditor Agreement and/or the Warner
Village Intercreditor Agreement (which amendment does not adversely affect the rights of the holders of
the Notes); provided that such Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not
impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent or adversely affect the rights,
duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee or the Security Agent under the Indenture or the
Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture will also provide that, at the written direction of the Company and without the consent of
the holders of the Notes, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall upon the written direction of the
Company from time to time enter into one or more amendments and/or restatements of the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Warner Village Intercreditor Agreement or any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement
to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency therein; (2) increase the amount of
Indebtedness permitted to be incurred or issued under the Indenture of the types covered thereby that
may be incurred by the Company or any Guarantors that is subject thereto (including the addition of
provisions relating to new Indebtedness); (3) add Guarantors thereto; (4) further secure the Notes
(including any Additional Notes); or (5) make any other such change thereto that does not adversely
affect the rights of holders of the Notes in any material respect.

The Indenture will provide that each holder of a Note, by accepting such Note, will be deemed to have
agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of each Intercreditor Agreement, the Warner Village
Intercreditor Agreement and Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to have authorized the Trustee and the
Security Agent to become a party to any such Intercreditor Agreement, Warner Village Intercreditor
Agreement and Additional Intercreditor Agreement, and any amendment referred to in the preceding
paragraph and the Trustee or the Security Agent will not be required to seek the consent of any holders
of Notes to perform its obligations under and in accordance with this covenant.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Notes issued thereunder
when:

(1) either:

(a) all Notes that have been authenticated, except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes that have been
replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has been deposited in trust and
thereafter repaid to the Company, have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or

(b) all Notes that have not been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and
payable by reason of the mailing of a notice of redemption or otherwise or will become due and

195


-----

payable within one year and the Company or any Guarantor has irrevocably deposited or
caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the
holders (i) in the case of the Fixed Rate Notes, cash in sterling, non-callable U.K. Government
Securities or a combination of cash in sterling and non-callable U.K. Government Securities or
(ii) in the case of the Floating Rate Notes, cash in euro, non-callable euro denominated
European Government Obligations or a combination of cash in euro and non-callable euro
denominated European Government Obligations, in each case, in amounts as will be sufficient,
without consideration of any reinvestment of interest, to pay and discharge the entire
Indebtedness on the Notes not delivered to the Trustee for cancellation for principal, premium
and Additional Amounts, if any, and accrued interest to the date of maturity or redemption;

(2) the Company or any Guarantor has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it under the
Indenture; and

(3) the Company has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the
deposited money toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the
case may be.

In addition, the Company must deliver an Officer’s Certificate and an opinion of counsel to the Trustee
stating that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied; provided that any
such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with
the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)).

**Judgment Currency**

Any payment on account of an amount that is payable in sterling or euro, as the case may be, which is
made to or for the account of any holder of the Notes or the Trustee in lawful currency of any other
jurisdiction (the ‘‘Judgment Currency’’), whether as a result of any judgment or order or the enforcement
thereof or the liquidation of the Company or any Guarantor, shall constitute a discharge of the Company
or the Guarantor’s obligation under the Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantee, as the case may be,
only to the extent of the amount of sterling or euro, as the case may be, that such holder or the Trustee,
as the case may be, could purchase in the London foreign exchange markets with the amount of the
Judgment Currency in accordance with normal banking procedures at the rate of exchange prevailing
on the first Business Day following receipt of the payment in the Judgment Currency. If the amount of
sterling or euro, as the case may be, that could be so purchased is less than the amount of sterling or
euro, as the case may be, originally due to such holder of the Notes or the Trustee, as the case may be,
the Company and the Guarantors shall indemnify and hold harmless the holder of the Notes or the
Trustee, as the case may be, from and against all loss or damage arising out of, or as a result of, such
deficiency. This indemnity shall constitute an obligation separate and independent from the other
obligations contained in the Indenture or the Notes, shall give rise to a separate and independent cause
of action, shall apply irrespective of any indulgence granted by any holder or the Trustee from time to
time and shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding any judgment or order for a liquidated
sum in respect of an amount due hereunder or under any judgment or order.

**Concerning the Trustee**

The Company shall deliver written notice to the Trustee within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the
occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default. If the Trustee becomes a creditor of the Company or any
Guarantor, the Indenture limits the right of the Trustee to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to
realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will
be permitted to engage in other transactions; however, if it acquires any conflicting, in its capacity as
Trustee, interest it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days or resign as Trustee.

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes will have the right
to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available
to the Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture provides that in case an Event of Default
occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of
care of a prudent man in the conduct of his own affairs. Subject to such provisions, the Trustee will be
under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any
holder of the Notes, unless such holder has offered to the Trustee security, and the Trustee has received,
and indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense.

196


-----

The Company and (following the Vue Acquisition Completion Date and/or the Multikino Acquisition
Completion Date) the Guarantors will indemnify the Trustee for certain claims, liabilities and expenses
incurred without fraud, negligence or willful misconduct on its part, arising out of or in connection with its
duties.

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

Notes sold to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A will initially be represented by a
global note in registered form without interest coupons attached (the ‘‘Rule 144A Global Note’’). Notes
sold outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S will initially be represented by a global note in
registered form without interest coupons attached (the ‘‘Regulation S Global Note’’ and, together with
the Rule 144A Global Note, the ‘‘Global Notes’’). The Global Notes will be deposited, on the closing date,
with, or on behalf of, a common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common
depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Except as set forth below, the Notes will be issued in registered global form in minimum denominations
of £100,000 and integral multiples of £1,000 thereof (in the case of the Fixed Rate Notes) and in minimum
denominations of e100,000 and integral multiples of e1,000 thereof (in the case of the Floating Rate
Notes).

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Note (the ‘‘Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests’’) and
ownership of interests in the Regulation S Global Note (the ‘‘Regulation S Book-Entry Interests’’ and,
together with the Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests, the ‘‘Book-Entry Interests’’) will be limited to persons
that have accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that hold interests through such
participants. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their
participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their
respective depositories. Except under the limited circumstances described below, Book-Entry Interests
will not be issued in definitive form.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records
maintained by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The laws of some jurisdictions,
including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take
physical delivery of those securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair your ability to
own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of
Book-Entry Interests will not be considered the owners or ‘‘holders’’ of Notes for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositary for Euroclear and/or Clearstream
(or its nominees), as applicable, will be considered the sole holders of the Global Notes for all purposes
under the Indenture. In addition, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream,
and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and the participants
through which they own Book-Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of
holders of Notes under the Indenture.

None of us, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar, the Calculation Agent or the Trustee will
have any responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive definitive registered
Notes in certificated form (‘‘Definitive Registered Notes’’) only:

(1) if either Euroclear or Clearstream notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as
depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days; or

(2) if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through
Euroclear or Clearstream following an event of default under the Indenture and enforcement
action is being taken in respect thereof under the Indenture.

In such an event, the Issuer will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and
issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear, Clearstream or us, as
applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions
received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such
Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend as provided in the Indenture, unless that
legend is not required by the Indenture or applicable law.

To the extent permitted by law, we, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar
shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof and no
person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Global Notes will be

224


-----

evidenced through registration from time to time at the registered office of the Issuer, and such
registration is a means of evidencing title to the Notes.

We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the Book-Entry
Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in
Euroclear and Clearstream.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the
amount received by them in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price
payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount
received by Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global
Note (or any portion thereof). We understand that, under the existing practices of Euroclear and
Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will
credit their participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions), by lot
or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate (including the pool factor); provided, however,
that no Book-Entry Interest of less than £100,000 or e100,000, as applicable, principal amount may be
redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

We will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal,
premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any) to the Paying Agent for onward payment to
Euroclear and Clearstream which will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their
customary procedures. We will make payments of all such amounts without deduction or withholding
for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of
whatever nature, except as may be required by law and as described under ‘‘Description of the Notes—
_Additional Amounts.’’ If any such deduction or withholding is required to be made, then, to the extent_
described under ‘‘Description of the Notes—Additional Amounts’’ we will pay Additional Amounts as may
be necessary in order for the net amounts received by any holder of the Global Notes or owner of
Book-Entry Interests after such deduction or withholding will equal the net amounts that such holder or
owner would have otherwise received in respect of such Global Note or Book-Entry Interest, as the case
may be, absent such withholding or deduction. We expect that standing customer instructions and
customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held
through such participants.

Under the terms of the Indenture, we, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent and the Paying
Agents will treat the registered holders of the Global Notes (i.e., the common depositary for Euroclear or
Clearstream (or its nominee)) as the owners thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all
other purposes. Consequently, none of us, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the
Registrar or any of their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

- any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating
to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest, for any such payments made by
Euroclear or Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant or for maintaining, supervising or
reviewing the records of Euroclear or Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating
to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest;

- any other matters relating to the actions and practices of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant
or indirect participant; or

- the records of the common depositary.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the
responsibility of such participants.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global
Notes will be paid to holders of interests to such Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream in pounds
sterling in the case of the Fixed Rate Notes and in euros in the case of the Floating Rate Notes.

225


-----

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a
holder of Notes (including the presentation of Notes for exchange as described above) only at the
direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are
credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such
participant or participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise
any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the
Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under the Notes, Euroclear and Clearstream, at the
request of the holders of the Notes, reserve the right to exchange the Global Notes for Definitive
Registered Notes and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to their participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in accordance with Euroclear
and Clearstream’s rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder of Notes requires
physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell Notes to persons in
states which require physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder of
Notes must transfer its interests in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth under ‘‘Transfer Restrictions.’’ Book Entry
Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements
discussed under ‘‘Transfer Restrictions.’’

Transfers of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Rule 144A Book-Entry
Interests will at all times be subject to such transfer restrictions.

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
Regulation S Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S
or Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act or any other exemption (if available under the U.S. Securities
Act).

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor
reasonably believes is a ‘‘qualified institutional buyer’’ within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction
meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions
described under ‘‘Transfer Restrictions’’ and in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any
other jurisdiction.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Rule 144A
Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount
of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A
Global Note.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note
only as described under ‘‘Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange’’ and, if required, only if the
transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the
effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes.
See ‘‘Transfer Restrictions.’’

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in
the form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry
Interest in the first-mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note,
and accordingly will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures
applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry
Interest.

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream,
as applicable. We have provided the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for

226


-----

the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of the settlement system are controlled by
the settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers are
responsible for those operations or procedures.

We understand as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream hold
securities for participating organizations. They facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities
transactions between their participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of such
participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the
safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded
securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and
Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers,
banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is
also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or
maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or
indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of
indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such
interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear and/or Clearstream system, or
otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for
that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of
securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may
be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will
receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream
participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List of the Irish Stock
Exchange and admitted for trading on the Global Exchange Market thereof. Transfers of interests in the
Global Notes between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in
accordance with their respective system’s rules and operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate
transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, they are under
no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be
discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuer, any Guarantor, the Initial Purchasers, the
Trustee, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar, the Calculation Agent or the Paying Agent will have any
responsibility for the performance by Euroclear, Clearstream or their participants or indirect participants
of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in pounds sterling and euros. Book-Entry Interests owned
through Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to
conventional bonds in registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody
accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the business day following the settlement date
against payment for value on the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear and Clearstream and will settle in
same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the
time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are
located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

227

**CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

_Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the tax_
_consequences, under the tax laws of the country in which they are resident, of a purchase of Notes_
_including, without limitation, the consequences of receipt of interest and premium, if any, on and sale or_
_redemption of, the Notes or any interest therein._

_References in this discussion to Notes acquired, owned, held or disposed of by noteholders include,_
_except where otherwise expressly stated, the Book-Entry Interests held by purchasers in the Notes in_
_global form deposited with, and registered in the name of the nominee for, the common depositary for_
_Euroclear and/or Clearstream._

**United Kingdom Taxation**

**The following applies only to persons who are the beneficial owners of Notes and is a summary of**
**the Company’s understanding of current United Kingdom law and published HM Revenue and**
**Customs practice relating only to the United Kingdom withholding tax treatment of payments of**
**interest in respect of Notes. The following is not exhaustive and does not deal with any other**
**United Kingdom taxation implications of acquiring, holding or disposing of Notes. The United**
**Kingdom tax treatment of prospective noteholders depends on their individual circumstances and**
**may be subject to change in the future. Prospective noteholders who may be subject to tax in a**
**jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom or who may be unsure as to their tax position should**
**seek their own professional advice.**

**_Payment of interest on the Notes_**

Payments of interest on the Notes may be made without deduction of or withholding on account of
United Kingdom income tax provided that the Notes continue to be listed on a ‘‘recognized stock
exchange’’ within the meaning of section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (the ‘‘Act’’). The Irish Stock
Exchange is a recognized stock exchange. The Notes will satisfy this requirement if they are officially
listed in Ireland in accordance with provisions corresponding to those generally applicable in EEA states
and are admitted to trading on the Global Exchange Market of the Irish Stock Exchange. Provided,
therefore, that the Notes remain so listed, interest on the Notes will be payable without withholding or
deduction on account of United Kingdom tax.

Interest on the Notes may also be paid without withholding or deduction on account of United Kingdom
tax where interest on the Notes is paid by a company and, at the time the payment is made, the Issuer
reasonably believes (and any person by or through whom interest on the Notes is paid reasonably
believes) that the beneficial owner is within the charge to United Kingdom corporation tax as regards the
payment of interest, provided that HM Revenue and Customs (‘‘HMRC’’) has not given a direction (in
circumstances where it has reasonable grounds to believe that it is likely that the above exemption is not
available in respect of such payment of interest at the time the payment is made) that the interest should
be paid under deduction of tax.

In other cases, an amount must generally be withheld from payments of interest on the Notes on account
of United Kingdom income tax at the basic rate (currently 20%). However, where an applicable double
tax treaty provides for a lower rate of withholding tax (or for no tax to be withheld) in relation to a
noteholder, HMRC can issue a notice to the Issuer to pay interest to the noteholder without deduction of
tax (or for interest to be paid with tax deducted at the rate provided for in the relevant double tax treaty).

If a Guarantor makes any payment in respect of interest on the Notes (or in respect of other amounts due
under the Notes other than the repayment of amounts subscribed for the Notes) such payments may be
subject to withholding on account of United Kingdom tax, subject to such relief as may be available
under the provisions of any applicable double tax treaty or any other relief that may apply. Such
payments by a Guarantor may not, however, be eligible for the exemptions from the obligation to
withhold tax described in the paragraphs above.

Any premium payable on redemption may be treated as a payment of interest for United Kingdom tax
purposes and may accordingly be subject to the withholding tax treatment described above.

Interest on the Notes constitutes United Kingdom source income for tax purposes. Accordingly, and
subject to exceptions applying to various categories of investors (including, in particular, exceptions

228


-----

applying to persons not resident in the United Kingdom), investors may be subject to United Kingdom
tax by direct assessment on such payments of interest even where paid without withholding.

HMRC has powers, in certain circumstances, to obtain information about: payments derived from
securities (whether income or capital); certain payments of interest (including the amount payable on the
redemption of a deeply discounted security); and securities transactions.

The persons from whom HMRC can obtain information include: a person who receives (or is entitled to
receive) a payment derived from securities; a person who makes such a payment (received from, or paid
on behalf of another person); a person by or through whom interest is paid or credited; a person who
effects or is a party to securities transactions (which includes an issue of securities) on behalf of others;
registrars or administrators in respect of securities transactions; and each registered or inscribed holder
of securities.

The information HMRC can obtain includes: details of the beneficial owner of securities; details of the
person for whom the securities are held, or the person to whom the payment is to be made (and, if more
than one, their respective interests); information and documents relating to securities transactions; and,
in relation to interest paid or credited on money received or retained in the United Kingdom, the identity
of the security under which interest is paid. HMRC is generally not able to obtain information (under its
power relating solely to interest) about a payment of interest to (or a receipt for) a person that is not an
individual. This limitation does not apply to HMRC’s power to obtain information about payments derived
from securities.

HMRC has indicated that it will not use its information-gathering power on interest to obtain information
about amounts payable on the redemption of deeply discounted securities which are paid before April 6,
2014.

In certain circumstances the information which HMRC has obtained using these powers may be
exchanged with tax authorities in other jurisdictions.

**_EU Savings Directive_**

Under EC Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income, Member States are required
to provide to the tax authorities of another Member State details of payments of interest (or similar
income) paid by a person within its jurisdiction to or for the benefit of, an individual resident in that other
Member State or to certain limited types of entities established in that other Member State. However, for a
transitional period, Luxembourg and Austria are instead required (unless during that period they elect
otherwise) to operate a withholding system in relation to such payments (the ending of such transitional
period being dependent upon the conclusion of certain other agreements relating to information
exchange with certain other countries). However, during that transitional period, withholding will not
apply under the directive to a payment if the beneficial owner of that payment authorizes exchange of
information instead.

A number of non-EU countries and territories including Switzerland have adopted similar measures (a
withholding system in the case of Switzerland).

The European Commission has proposed certain amendments to the Directive, which may, if
implemented, amend or broaden the scope of the requirements described above.

In April 2013, the Luxembourg Government announced its intention to abolish the withholding system
with effect from January 1, 2015, in favor of automatic information exchange under the Directive.

**_Stamp Duty and Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (‘‘SDRT’’)_**

No United Kingdom stamp duty or SDRT is payable on the issue of the Notes or on a transfer of the
Notes.

**CIRCUMSTANCES FROM AN INDEPENDENT TAX ADVISER.**

The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations relevant to U.S. Holders
and Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below) acquiring, holding and disposing of Notes. This summary
addresses only the U.S. federal income tax considerations for persons who purchase the Notes for cash
at their issue price (as defined below) that will hold the Notes as capital assets (generally, property held
for investment). This summary is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the ‘‘Code’’), final,
temporary and proposed U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative and judicial interpretations, all of
which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect.

This summary does not discuss all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to
investors in light of their particular circumstances, such as investors subject to special tax rules
(including, without limitation: (i) financial institutions; (ii) insurance companies; (iii) dealers or traders in
stocks, securities, currencies or notional principal contracts; (iv) regulated investment companies;
(v) real estate investment trusts; (vi) tax-exempt organizations; (vii) partnerships, pass-through entities,
or persons that hold Notes through pass-through entities; (viii) investors that hold Notes as part of a
straddle, hedge, conversion, constructive sale or other integrated transaction for U.S. federal income tax
purposes; (ix) U.S. Holders that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar; and (x) U.S.
expatriates and former long-term residents of the United States, all of whom may be subject to tax rules
that differ significantly from those summarized below. This summary does not address U.S. federal
estate, gift, alternative minimum tax considerations or the Medicare tax on net investment income, or
non-U.S., state or local tax considerations.

For the purposes of this summary, a ‘‘U.S. Holder’’ is a beneficial owner of Notes that is for U.S. federal
income tax purposes (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation
created in, or organized under the laws of, the United States or any state thereof, including the District of
Columbia, (iii) an estate the income of which is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax
purposes regardless of its source or (iv) a trust the administration of which is subject to the primary
supervision of a U.S. court and which has one or more United States persons who have the authority to
control all substantial decisions of the trust. A ‘‘Non-U.S. Holder’’ is a beneficial owner of Notes that is not
a U.S. Holder or a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

If a partnership (or other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax
purposes) is an owner of Notes, the treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend on the
status of the partner and upon the activities of the partnership. Partnerships holding Notes and the
partners therein should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences to them of holding the
Notes.

**_U.S. Holders_**

_Payments of Interest_

Payments of stated interest on a Note (without reduction for any amounts withheld and including
payments of any Additional Amounts) will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary income at the time it is
received or accrued, in accordance with the holder’s method of accounting for tax purposes. The
amount of income recognized by a cash basis U.S. Holder will be the U.S. dollar value of the interest
payment, based on the exchange rate in effect on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment
is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. An accrual basis U.S. Holder may determine the amount of income
recognized with respect to an interest payment denominated in, or determined by reference to, a foreign
currency in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, the amount of income
accrued will be based on the average exchange rate in effect during the interest accrual period (or, with
respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. Holder, the part of the period within
the taxable year). Under the second method, the U.S. Holder may elect to determine the amount of
income accrued on the basis of the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the accrual period or, in the
case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years, the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the
part of the period within the taxable year. Additionally, if a payment of interest is received within five
business days of the last day of the accrual period, an electing accrual basis U.S. Holder may instead
translate the accrued interest into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the day of receipt. Any
such election will apply to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder at the beginning of the first taxable

230


-----

year to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by the U.S. Holder, and will be irrevocable
without the consent of the IRS.

Upon receipt of an interest payment (including a payment attributable to accrued but unpaid interest
upon the sale or other disposition of a Note) denominated in a foreign currency, an accrual basis U.S.
Holder will recognize U.S. source exchange gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss) equal to the
difference, if any, between the amount received (translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date of
receipt) and the amount previously accrued (as determined above), regardless of whether the payment
is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. Interest paid by the Issuer on the Notes (without reduction for any
amounts withheld) and payments of any Additional Amounts will generally constitute income from
sources outside the United States.

_Sale or Other Disposition of Notes_

Generally, upon the sale, exchange or redemption of a Note, a U.S. Holder will recognize taxable gain or
loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale, exchange, or redemption (less any
amount attributable to accrued but unpaid interest not previously included in income, which will be
taxable as such) and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax
basis in a Note will generally equal the cost of such Note to such U.S. Holder reduced by the amount of
any payments made with respect to the Note that are not qualified stated interest payments. A U.S.
Holder’s tax basis in a Note will be determined by reference to the U.S. dollar cost of the Note. The U.S.
dollar cost of a Note purchased with a foreign currency will generally be the U.S. dollar value of the
purchase price on the date of purchase.

Except to the extent attributable to accrued but unpaid interest or changes in exchange rates, gain or
loss recognized on the sale or other disposition of a Note will generally be capital gain or loss and will be
long term capital gain or loss if at the time of sale or other disposition the Note has been held by such
U.S. Holder for more than one year, and will generally be treated as from U.S. sources for purposes of the
U.S. foreign tax credit limitation. The amount realized on a sale or other disposition for an amount in
foreign currency will be the U.S. dollar value of this amount on the date of sale or other disposition or, in
the case of Notes traded on an established securities market, as defined in the applicable U.S. Treasury
regulations, if sold by a cash basis U.S. Holder (or an accrual basis U.S. Holder that so elects), on the
settlement date for the sale. Such an election by an accrual basis U.S. Holder must be applied
consistently from year to year and cannot be revoked without the consent of the IRS. In the case of a U.S.
Holder that is an individual, estate or trust, the maximum marginal U.S. federal income tax rate applicable
to long term capital gains is currently lower than the maximum marginal rate applicable to ordinary
income. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to significant limitations.

Gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on the sale or other disposition of a Note that is attributable to
changes in exchange rates will be treated as U.S. source ordinary income or loss. Gain or loss
attributable to changes in exchange rates generally will equal the difference, if any, between the U.S.
dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s foreign currency purchase price for the Note, determined at the spot rate
on the date the U.S. Holder disposes of the Note (or on the settlement date, if the Notes are then traded
on an established securities market and the holder is either a cash basis U.S. Holder or an electing
accrual basis U.S. Holder) and the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s purchase price for the Note,
determined at the spot rate on the date the U.S. Holder purchased such Note. In addition, upon the sale,
exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder may realize
exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued and unpaid stated
interest, which will be treated as discussed above under ‘‘—Payments of Interest.’’ However, exchange
gain or loss (including with respect to accrued interest) is taken into account only to the extent of total
gain or loss realized on the transaction.

_Disposition of Foreign Currency_

Foreign currency received as interest on a Note or on the sale or other disposition of a Note will generally
have a tax basis equal to its U.S. dollar value at the time the interest is received or at the time of the sale or
other disposition. Foreign currency that is purchased will generally have a tax basis equal to the U.S.
dollar value of the foreign currency on the date of purchase. Any gain or loss recognized on a sale or
other disposition of a foreign currency (including its use to purchase Notes or an exchange for U.S.
dollars) will be U.S. source ordinary income or loss.

231


-----

**_Non-U.S. Holders_**

A Non-U.S. Holder generally should not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax on any
payments on the Notes and gain from the sale, redemption or other disposition of the Notes unless:
(i) that payment and/or gain is effectively connected with the conduct by that Non-U.S. Holder of a trade
or business in the United States (and, if an income tax treaty requires, such items are attributable to the
conduct of a trade or business through a permanent establishment or fixed base in the United States) or
(ii) in the case of any gain realized on the sale, redemption or other disposition of a Note by an individual
Non-U.S. Holder, that holder is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the
sale, redemption or other disposition and certain other conditions are met.

**_Backup Withholding and Information Reporting_**

In general, payments of principal and interest on, and the proceeds of a sale, redemption or other
disposition of, the Notes, payable to a U.S. Holder by a U.S. paying agent or other U.S. intermediary will
be reported to the IRS and to the U.S. Holder as may be required under applicable regulations. Backup
withholding will apply to these payments if the U.S. Holder fails to provide an accurate taxpayer
identification number or certification of exempt status or otherwise fails to comply with the applicable
backup withholding requirements. Certain U.S. Holders are not subject to backup withholding.

Certain U.S. Holders may be required to report to the IRS certain information with respect to their
beneficial ownership of the Notes not held through an account with a financial institution. Investors who
fail to report required information could be subject to substantial penalties.

In general, payments of principal and interest on, and the proceeds of a sale, redemption or other
disposition of, the Notes, payable to a Non-U.S. Holder by a U.S. paying agent or other U.S. intermediary
will not be subject to backup withholding tax and information reporting requirements if an appropriate
certification (IRS Form W-8BEN or other appropriate form) is provided by the Non-U.S. Holder to the
payor and the payor does not have actual knowledge that the certificate is false.

**_Disclosure Requirements_**

U.S. Treasury regulations meant to require the reporting of certain tax shelter transactions (‘‘Reportable
Transactions’’) could be interpreted to cover transactions generally not regarded as tax shelters,
including certain foreign currency transactions. Under the Treasury regulations, certain transactions with
respect to the Notes may be characterized as Reportable Transactions including, in certain
circumstances, a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note. Persons considering
the purchase of Notes should consult with their tax advisors to determine the tax return obligations, if
any, with respect to an investment in the Notes, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886
(Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement).

**German Taxation**

The following is a general discussion of certain German tax consequences of the acquisition, holding
and disposal of the Notes. It does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all German tax
considerations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase Notes (e.g., tax considerations
concerning non-resident holders presenting Notes for an over-the-counter payment (Tafelgesch¨aft) to a
German Disbursing Agent (as defined below)), and, in particular, does not consider any specific facts or
circumstances that may apply to a particular purchaser. This summary is based on the tax laws of
Germany currently in force and as applied on the date of this offering memorandum, which are subject to
change, possibly with retroactive or retrospective effect.

Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the tax
consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes, including the effect of any state,
local or church taxes, under the tax laws of Germany and any country of which they are resident or
whose tax laws apply to them for other reasons.

232


-----

**_Taxation of Current Income and Capital Gains_**

_Tax Residents_

This subsection ‘‘Tax Residents’’ refers to persons who are tax residents of Germany (i.e., persons
whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat, or place of effective management and control is
located in Germany).

Income derived from capital investments under the Notes as well as capital gains (which include
currency gains and losses, if any) from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes
held by an individual holder who is tax resident in Germany are in general subject to German income tax
at a flat-tax rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge and, where applicable, church tax thereon)
(Abgeltungsteuer) if the Notes are held as private investment (Privatverm¨ogen). Individual holders who
are tax resident in Germany are entitled to a maximum annual allowance (Sparer-Pauschbetrag) of e801
(e1,602 for married couples filing jointly); actually incurred higher expenses directly attributable to a
capital investment are not deductible.

The personal income tax liability of an individual holder who is tax resident in Germany on income from
capital investments under the Notes will, in principle, be settled by the tax withheld (as described under
section ‘‘Withholding Tax’’ below). To the extent withholding tax has not been levied, such as in the case
of Notes kept in custody abroad or, if no Disbursing Agent is involved in the payment process, the
individual holder must include his or her income and capital gains derived from the Notes in his or her
annual tax return and will then also be taxed at a rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge and, where
applicable, church tax thereon). Further, an individual holder may apply for a taxation of all investment
income of a given year at his or her lower individual tax rate based upon an assessment to tax with any
amounts over-withheld being refunded. In each case, the deduction of expenses (other than transaction
costs) on an itemized basis is not permitted.

Losses incurred with respect to the Notes can only be offset with investment income of the individual
holder realized in the same or following years. Pursuant to a tax decree issued by the German Federal
Ministry of Finance dated October 9, 2012 losses from bad debts (Forderungsausfall) or a waiver of a
receivable (Forderungsverzicht) to the extent the waiver does not qualify as a hidden capital contribution
shall not be treated as a disposal. Accordingly, losses incurred from bad debts and waivers shall not be
tax-deductible if the Notes are held as private investment (Privatverm¨ogen). The same rules should be
applicable according to the said tax decree, if the Notes expire worthless so that losses may not be
tax-deductible at all. Losses suffered in a sale of Notes will only be recognized according to the view of
the tax authorities, if the proceeds received in the sale exceed the respective transaction costs.

Where Notes form part of a trade or business of an individual or corporate holder or the income from the
Notes qualifies as income from the letting and leasing of property, the withholding tax, if any, will not
settle the personal or corporate income tax liability. Rather, the income is subject to individual or
corporate income tax (plus solidarity surcharge and, where applicable, church tax). Where Notes form
part of a trade or business, interest (paid or accrued) must be taken into account as income. The
respective holder will have to include income and related (business) expenses in the annual tax return
and the balance will be taxed at the holder’s applicable tax rate. Withholding tax levied, if any, will be
credited as advance payment against the personal or corporate income tax liability of the holder or, to
the extent exceeding this personal or corporate income tax liability, will be refunded. Where Notes form
part of a German trade or business the current income and gains from the disposal, redemption,
repayment or assignment of the Notes may also be subject to German trade tax. The trade tax liability
depends on the municipal trade tax factor (Gewerbesteuerhebesatz). If the holder is an individual or an
individual partner of a partnership, the trade tax may generally be completely or partly credited against
the personal income tax pursuant to a lump sum tax credit method.

_Non-Tax Residents_

Interest, including accrued interest, and capital gains (which include currency gains and losses, if any)
from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes received by holders who are not
tax-resident in Germany (i.e., holders whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat and place of
effective management and control is not located in Germany) are generally not subject to German
taxation, unless (i) the Notes form part of the business property of a permanent establishment, including
a permanent representative, or a fixed base maintained in Germany by the holder or (ii) the income
otherwise constitutes German source income. Among other things, interest payments under the Notes

233


-----

would be considered German-source income if the Notes were secured by German real estate, unless
the Notes (x) are registered in a public debt register (¨offentliches Schuldbuch), (y) a global note
(Sammelurkunde) has been issued to evidence the Notes, or (z) qualify as fungible notes representing
the same issue (Teilschuldverschreibungen) for German tax purposes. In cases (i) and (ii) above a tax
regime similar to that explained above under subsection ‘‘—Tax Residents’’ applies save that a
deduction of expenses incurred by the non-resident Noteholder may be limited to e801 even if the Notes
form part of a trade or business. Subject to certain requirements a holder who is not tax-resident in
Germany may benefit from tax reductions or tax exemptions provided by an applicable tax treaty.

**_Withholding Tax_**

Ongoing payments received by an individual holder of the Notes who is a German tax resident will be
subject to German withholding tax if the Notes are kept or administered in a custodial account with a
German branch of a German or non-German bank or financial services institution, a German securities
trading company or a German securities trading bank (each, a ‘‘Disbursing Agent,’’ auszahlende Stelle).
The tax rate is 25% (plus solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding being
26.375%). Individuals subject to church tax may apply in writing for church tax to be levied by way of
withholding also. Absent such application, such individuals have to include their investment income in
their income tax return and will then be assessed to church tax. For Disbursing Agents, an electronic
information system for church withholding tax purposes will apply in relation to investment income
received after December 31, 2014, with the effect that church tax will be collected by the Disbursing
Agent by way of withholding, unless the holders has filed a blocking notice (Sperrvermerk) with the
German Federal Central Tax Office (Bundeszentralamt f¨ur Steuern) in which case the holders will be
assessed to church tax.

The same treatment applies to capital gains (i.e., the difference between the proceeds from the disposal,
redemption, repayment or assignment after deduction of expenses directly related to the disposal,
redemption, repayment or assignment and the cost of acquisition, taking into account currency gains
and losses, if any) derived by an individual holder who is a German resident irrespective of any holding
period, provided the Notes have been held in a custodial account with the same Disbursing Agent since
the time of their acquisition. If interest coupons or interest claims are disposed of separately (i.e., without
the Notes), the proceeds from the disposition are subject to withholding tax. The same applies to
proceeds from the sale or redemption of interest coupons or interest claims if the Notes have been
disposed of separately.

To the extent the Notes have not been kept in a custodial account with the same Disbursing Agent since
the time of their acquisition, upon the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment withholding tax
applies at a rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding being
26.375%, plus church tax, if applicable) on 30% of the disposal proceeds (plus interest accrued on the
Notes (St¨uckzinsen), if any), unless the Disbursing Agent has been provided with evidence of the actual
acquisition costs of the Notes by the previous Disbursing Agent or by a statement of a bank or financial
services institution within the European Economic Area or certain other countries in accordance with Art.
17 para. 2 of the Council Directive 2003/48/EC dated June 3, 2003 on the Taxation of Savings Income in
the form of interest payments (the ‘‘EU Savings Tax Directive’’) (e.g., Switzerland or Andorra). If the
withholding tax on a disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes has been calculated
on the basis of 30% of the disposal proceeds (rather than from the actual gain), a German tax resident
individual holder may and in case the actual gain is higher than 30% of the disposal proceeds must also
apply for an assessment on the basis of his or her actual acquisition costs.

In computing any German withholding tax, the Disbursing Agent may generally deduct from the basis of
the withholding tax negative investment income realized by the individual holder of the Notes via the
Disbursing Agent (e.g., losses from the sale of other securities with the exception of shares). The
Disbursing Agent may also deduct accrued interest on the Notes or other securities paid separately
upon the acquisition of the respective security via the Disbursing Agent. In addition, subject to certain
requirements and restrictions the Disbursing Agent may credit foreign withholding taxes levied on
investment income in a given year regarding securities held by the individual holder in the custodial
account with the Disbursing Agent.

Upon the individual holder filing an exemption certificate (Freistellungsauftrag) with the Disbursing
Agent, the Disbursing Agent will take a maximum annual allowance (Sparer-Pauschbetrag) of e801
(e1,602 for married couples filing jointly) into account when computing the amount of tax to be withheld

-----

from the gross payment to be made by the Disbursing Agent. No withholding tax will be deducted if the
holder of the Notes has submitted to the Disbursing Agent a certificate of non-assessment
(Nichtveranlagungsbescheinigung) issued by the competent local tax office.

German withholding tax will generally not apply to gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or
assignment of Notes held by a corporate holder who is a German resident (including via a commercial
partnership, as the case may be, and provided that in the case of corporations of certain legal forms the
status of corporation has been evidenced by a certificate of the competent tax office) while ongoing
payments, such as interest payments, are subject to withholding tax (irrespective of any deductions of
foreign tax and losses incurred). The same may apply where the Notes form part of a trade or business
(of an individual or of a commercial partnership) subject to further requirements being met.

Non-residents of Germany are, in general, not subject to German withholding tax on investment income
and the solidarity surcharge thereon. However, where the investment income is subject to German
taxation (as described above under subsection ‘‘—Non-Tax Residents’’) and the Notes are held in a
custodial account with a Disbursing Agent, withholding tax will be levied under certain circumstances.
The withholding tax may be refunded based on an assessment to tax or under an applicable tax treaty.

**_Inheritance and Gift Tax_**

A gratuitous transfer of Notes by reason of death or as a gift will be subject to German inheritance or gift
tax if the decedent or donor or the heir, donee or other beneficiary is at the time of the transfer a resident
or deemed to be a resident of Germany. If neither the holder nor the recipient is a resident or deemed to
be a resident of Germany at the time of the transfer, no German inheritance or gift taxes will be levied
unless the Notes are attributable to a German trade or business for which a permanent establishment is
maintained or a permanent representative has been appointed in Germany. Exceptions from this rule
apply to certain German citizens who previously maintained a residence in Germany.

**_Other Taxes_**

No stamp, issue or registration taxes or duties will be payable in Germany in connection with the
issuance, delivery or execution of the Notes. Currently, net assets tax is not levied in Germany. Holders of
the Notes should clarify themselves (or with their tax advisors) whether church tax is payable as set out
above.

The European Commission and certain EU member states (including Germany) are currently intending
to introduce a financial transaction tax (‘‘FTT’’) (presumably on secondary market transactions involving
at least one financial intermediary). It is currently proposed that the FTT should be introduced in the
participating EU member states on January 1, 2014. If the FTT is introduced, transfers of Notes in which
a financial intermediary established or deemed established in a participating member state is involved
may be subject to FTT at a rate that will be determined separately by each participating member state.

**_EU Savings Directive_**

By legislative regulations dated January 26, 2004, the German Federal Government enacted provisions
implementing the information exchange on the basis of EU Savings Directive.

**Polish Taxation**

Polish tax law provides withholding on payments made to foreign tax resident corporate income tax
payers only concerning a number of specific types of payments (the ‘‘Withholdable Payments’’).

Withholdable Payments do not include payments made by a guarantor under its obligation resulting
from the guarantee. However, if the guarantee covers the payment of one or more Withholdable
Payments, there is a risk that the tax authorities may consider that the payment under the guarantee
should be treated in the same way as a payment of the Withholdable Payment(s). Consequently, there is
a risk that if the Polish Guarantor makes a payment which covers interest, the Polish tax authorities will
consider that the part of the payment which relates to the interest is subject to Polish withholding tax.

Under domestic tax regulations, withholding tax on interest is subject to 20%; however, a lower rate of full
exemption could apply, for example, under the relevant double tax treaty.

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

Unless otherwise provided in any supplement to this offering memorandum, the Notes should be eligible
for purchase by employee benefit plans and other plans subject to Title I of the U.S. Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (‘‘ERISA’’), and/or the provisions of Section 4975
of the Code and by governmental, church and non-U.S. plans that are subject to state, local, other
federal law of the United States or non-U.S. law that is substantially similar to ERISA or the Code (‘‘Similar
Law’’) subject to consideration of the issues described in this section. ERISA imposes certain
requirements on ‘‘employee benefit plans’’ (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) subject to ERISA,
including entities such as collective investment funds and separate accounts whose underlying assets
include the assets of such plans (collectively, ‘‘ERISA Plans’’), and on those persons who are fiduciaries
with respect to ERISA Plans. Investments by ERISA Plans are subject to ERISA’s general fiduciary
requirements, including the requirements of investment prudence and diversification and the
requirement that an ERISA Plan’s investments be made in accordance with the documents governing
the ERISA Plan. The prudence of a particular investment must be determined by the responsible
fiduciary of an ERISA Plan by taking into account the ERISA Plan’s particular circumstances and all of the
facts and circumstances of the investment including, but not limited to, the matters discussed under
‘‘Risk Factors.’’

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of
an ERISA Plan (as well as those plans that are not subject to ERISA but which are subject to Section 4975
of the Code, such as individual retirement accounts (together with ERISA Plans, the ‘‘Plans’’)) and
certain persons (referred to as ‘‘parties in interest’’ or ‘‘disqualified persons’’) having certain
relationships to such Plans, unless a statutory or administrative exemption is applicable to the
transaction. A party in interest or disqualified person, including a Plan fiduciary, who engages in a
prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and
the Code.

The Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar, the Initial
Purchasers or any other party to the transactions referred to in this offering memorandum may be parties
in interest or disqualified persons with respect to many Plans. Prohibited transactions within the meaning
of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code may arise if any of the Notes is acquired or held by a
Plan, including but not limited to where the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the
Transfer Agent, the Registrar, the Initial Purchasers or any other party to such transactions is a party in
interest or a disqualified person. Certain exemptions from the prohibited transaction provisions of
Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code may be applicable, however, depending in part on
the type of Plan fiduciary making the decision to acquire any Notes and the circumstances under which
such decision is made. Included among these exemptions are Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and
Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code (relating to transactions between a person that is a party in interest
(other than a fiduciary or an affiliate that has or exercises discretionary authority or control or renders
investment advice with respect to assets involved in the transaction) solely by reason of providing
services to the plan, provided that there is adequate consideration for the transaction), Prohibited
Transaction Class Exemption (‘‘PTCE’’) 91-38 (relating to investments by bank collective investment
funds), PTCE 84-14 (relating to transactions effected by a qualified professional asset manager), PTCE
95-60 (relating to transactions involving insurance company general accounts), PTCE 90-1 (relating to
investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts) and PTCE 96-23 (relating to transactions
determined by in-house asset managers). Prospective investors should consult with their advisors
regarding the prohibited transaction rules and these exceptions. There can be no assurance that any of
these exemptions or any other exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction
involving any Notes.

Governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in
Section 3(33) of ERISA) and non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA), while not subject
to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406
of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to Similar Law. Fiduciaries of any
such plans should consult with their counsel before purchasing the Notes to determine the need for, if
necessary, and the availability of, any exemptive relief under any Similar Law.

In addition, the U.S. Department of Labor has promulgated a regulation, 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101,
as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA (the ‘‘Plan Asset Regulation’’), describing what constitutes the
assets of a Plan with respect to the Plan’s investment in an entity for purposes of certain provisions of

236


-----

ERISA, including the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA, and Section 4975 of the Code.
Under the Plan Asset Regulation, if a Plan invests in an equity interest of an entity that is neither a
publicly-offered security nor a security issued by an investment company registered under the United
States Investment Company Act of 1940, the Plan’s assets include both the equity interest and an
undivided interest in each of the entity’s underlying assets, unless one of the exceptions to such
treatment described in the Plan Asset Regulation applies. Under the Plan Asset Regulation, a security
which is in the form of debt may be considered an equity interest if it has substantial equity features. If the
Group was deemed under the Plan Asset Regulation to hold plan assets (as defined in Section 3(42) of
ERISA or any applicable Similar Law, ‘‘Plan Assets’’) by reason of a Plan’s investment in any of the Notes,
such Plan Assets would include an undivided interest in the assets held by the Group and transactions
by the Group would be subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA and the
prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code. The Plan Asset Regulation
provides, however, that if equity participation in any entity by ‘‘Benefit Plan Investors’’ is not significant,
then the ‘‘look-through’’ rule will not apply to such entity. The term ‘‘Benefit Plan Investors’’ is defined in
the Plan Asset Regulation to include (1) any employee benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA)
subject to Title I of ERISA, (2) any plan described in Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code, and (3) any entity
whose underlying assets include Plan Assets by reason of any such employee benefit plan or plan’s
investment in the entity. Equity participation by Benefit Plan Investors in any entity is significant if,
immediately after the most recent acquisition of any equity interest in the entity, 25% or more of the value
of any class of equity interests in the entity (excluding the value of any interests held by certain persons,
other than Benefit Plan Investors, exercising control over the assets of the entity or providing investment
advice to the entity for a fee or any affiliates of such persons) is held by Benefit Plan Investors. If, as a
result of any investment, 25% or more of the value of any class of equity interests in the Issuer is being
held by Benefit Plan Investors, the applicable Notes may be redeemed by the Issuer. While there is little
pertinent authority in this area and no assurance can be given, the Issuer believes that the Notes should
not be treated as equity interests for the purposes of the Plan Asset Regulation and, therefore, the Plan
Asset Regulation should not apply and any such redemptions would not be necessary.

Accordingly, except as otherwise provided in any supplement to this offering memorandum, each
purchaser and subsequent transferee of any Notes will represent and warrant, on each day from the date
on which the purchaser or transferee acquires such Notes (or any interest therein) through and including
the date on which the purchaser or transferee disposes of such Notes (or any interest therein), either that
(a) it is not a Plan or any entity whose underlying assets include, or are deemed for purposes of ERISA or
the Code to include, Plan Assets or a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan which is subject to any
Similar Law or (b) its acquisition, holding and disposition of such Notes (or any interest therein) will not
constitute or result in a prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code
(or, in the case of a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan subject to Similar Law, a violation of any
Similar Law) for which an exemption is not available.

Each Plan fiduciary who is responsible for making the investment decisions whether to purchase or
commit to purchase and to hold any of the Notes should determine whether, under the documents and
instruments governing the Plan, an investment in such Notes is appropriate for the Plan, taking into
account the overall investment policy of the Plan and the composition of the Plan’s investment portfolio.
Any Plan proposing to invest in such Notes (including any governmental, church or non-U.S. plan)
should consult with its counsel to confirm that such investment will not constitute or result in a
non-exempt prohibited transaction and will satisfy the other requirements of ERISA and the Code (or, in
the case of a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan, any Similar Law).

The sale of any Notes to a Plan is in no respect a representation by the Issuer, the Guarantors, the
Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar, the Initial Purchasers or any other party to
the transactions that such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to
investments by Plans generally or any particular Plan, or that such an investment is appropriate for Plans
generally or any particular Plan.

Any further ERISA considerations with respect to the Notes may be found in the relevant supplement.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept
delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by
counsel.

The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes initially at the price indicated on the cover page hereof.
After the initial offering, the offering price and other selling terms of the Notes may from time to time be
varied by the Initial Purchasers without notice.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and
other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the
offering price set forth on the cover page hereof. Sale of the Notes may be made through affiliates of the
Initial Purchasers or through registered broker-dealers.

The Purchase Agreement provides that we will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers
against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute to
payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. We have agreed,
subject to certain limited exceptions, not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, except as
provided under the Purchase Agreement, any debt securities of, or guaranteed by, us that are
substantially similar to the Notes during the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement through
and including the date 90 days after the date of the Purchase Agreement.

The Notes and Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act. The
Initial Purchasers have agreed that they will only offer or sell the Notes (i) in the United States to
‘‘qualified institutional buyers’’ in accordance with Rule 144A, and (ii) outside the United States in
offshore transactions in accordance with Regulation S. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings
given to them by Rule 144A and Regulation S. Any offer or sale of the Notes in the United States in
reliance on Rule 144A will be made by broker-dealers who are registered as such under the U.S.
Exchange Act. Until 40 days after the later of (i) the commencement of this Offering and (ii) the issue date
of the Notes, an offer or sale of the Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not
participating in the Offering) may violate the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if such
offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A or another exemption from, or in a
transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. Terms used in this
paragraph have meanings given to them by Regulation S. Resales of the Notes are restricted as
described under ‘‘Transfer Restrictions.’’

Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed with us that:

(1) it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause
to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity, within the
meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA, received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any
Notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to us, and

(2) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to
anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by us
or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or
distribution of this offering memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any
jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold,
directly or indirectly, and neither this offering memorandum nor any other offering material or
advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or

238


-----

jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or
jurisdiction. This offering memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to
purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose
possession this offering memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe
any restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of this offering memorandum and resale of the
Notes. See ‘‘Transfer Restrictions.’’

The Issuer and the Guarantors have also agreed that they will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell,
pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such
offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the
U.S. Securities Act or the safe harbor of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer
and sale of the Notes.

The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. We have applied, through
our listing agent, for the Notes to be admitted to the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and to be
admitted for trading on the Global Exchange Market thereof, however, we cannot assure you that the
Notes will be approved for listing or that such listing will be maintained.

The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market-making
activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In
addition, any such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the U.S. Securities Act
and the U.S. Exchange Act, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will
be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which
will be favorable to you. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the Guarantees—There may
_not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.’’_

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date
specified on the cover page of this offering memorandum, which will be five business days (as such term
is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes
(this settlement cycle is being referred to as ‘‘T+5’’). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, trades
in the secondary market generally are required to settle in three business days unless the parties to any
such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date
of this offering memorandum or the next successive business day will be required to specify an
alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the
Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors.

In connection with the Offering, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may engage in
transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, the Stabilizing
Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in the open markets to
stabilize the price of the Notes. The Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may also over
allot the Offering, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open
market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on
its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in market-making transactions as permitted by applicable
laws and regulations and impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective
market price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not
required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no
assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks
_Relating to the Notes and the Guarantees—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in_
_which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.’’_

The Initial Purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and
penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the U.S. Exchange Act.

The proceeds from the issuance of the Notes in this Offering will be used for the Vue Acquisition
purchase price, to repay the Existing Bank Facility, drawings under the existing working capital facility
and Vue existing shareholder loan notes, for the Multikino Acquisition purchase price and certain of the
existing borrowings of Multikino. Lloyds TSB Bank plc is a lender and provides hedging in connection
with the Existing Bank Facility. Lloyds TSB Bank plc is acting as arranger, facility agent and security
agent for our Revolving Credit Facility. Certain of the Initial Purchasers may enter into hedging
arrangements in connection with the Revolving Credit Facility.

In addition, Goldman Sachs International or its respective affiliates, has acted as financial and M&A
advisor to OPE and AIMCo and Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc or its respective affiliates, has
acted as financial and M&A advisor to Doughty Hanson in connection with the Vue Acquisition.

One or more of the Initial Purchasers may sell through affiliates or other appropriately licensed entities
for sales of the Notes in jurisdictions where they are otherwise not permitted.

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

_You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or other transfer of any of_
_the Notes offered hereby._

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act or
any state securities laws and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an
exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act
and applicable state securities laws. Accordingly, the Notes offered hereby are being offered and sold
only to qualified institutional buyers (as defined in Rule 144A) in reliance on Rule 144A and to non-U.S.
persons outside the United States in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S.

We have not registered and will not register the Notes or the Guarantees under the U.S. Securities Act
and, therefore, the Notes may not be offered or sold within the United States except pursuant to an
exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities
Act. Accordingly, we are offering and selling the Notes to the Initial Purchasers for re-offer and resale
only:

- in the United States to ‘‘qualified institutional buyers,’’ commonly referred to as ‘‘QIBs,’’ as defined
in Rule 144A in compliance with Rule 144A; and

- to non-U.S. persons outside the United States in offshore transactions in accordance with
Regulation S.

We use the terms ‘‘non-U.S. persons,’’ ‘‘offshore transaction’’ and ‘‘United States’’ with the meanings
given to them in Regulation S.

Each purchaser of Notes, by its acceptance thereof, will be deemed to have acknowledged, represented
to and agreed with the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers as follows:

(1) It understands and acknowledges that the Notes and the Guarantees have not been registered
under the U.S. Securities Act or any other applicable state securities laws, and that the Notes
are being offered for resale in transactions not requiring registration under the U.S. Securities
Act or any state securities law, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A, and, unless so registered,
may not be offered, sold or otherwise transferred except in compliance with the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act or any other applicable state securities laws, pursuant to
an exemption therefrom or in any transaction not subject thereto and in each case in
compliance with the conditions for transfer set forth in paragraphs (4) and (5) below.

(2) It is not an ‘‘affiliate’’ (as defined in Rule 144) of the Issuer or acting on behalf of the Issuer and it
is either:

(i) a QIB and is aware that any sale of Notes to it will be made in reliance on Rule 144A, and
the acquisition of Notes will be for its own account or for the account of another QIB; or

(ii) it is purchasing the Notes in an offshore transaction in accordance with Regulation S.

(3) It acknowledges that none of the Issuer, the Guarantors, or the Initial Purchasers, or any person
representing any of them, have made any representation to it with respect to the offering or sale
of any Notes, other than the information contained in this offering memorandum, which offering
memorandum has been delivered to it and upon which it is relying in making its investment
decision with respect to the Notes. It has had access to such financial and other information
concerning us, the Issuer and its subsidiaries and the Notes as it has deemed necessary in
connection with its decision to purchase any of the Notes, including an opportunity to ask
questions of, and request information from, the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers.

(4) It is purchasing the Notes for its own account, or for one or more investor accounts for which it
is acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not with a view to, or for offer
or sale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the U.S. Securities Act or any
state securities laws, subject to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the
property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and
subject to its or their ability to resell such Notes pursuant to Rule 144A, Regulation S or any
other exemption from registration available under the U.S. Securities Act.

(5) Each holder of Notes issued in reliance on Rule 144A (‘‘Rule 144A Notes’’) agrees on its own
behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which it is purchasing the Notes, and each

240


-----

subsequent holder of the Rule 144A Notes by its acceptance thereof will be deemed to agree,
to offer, sell or otherwise transfer such Notes prior to the date (the ‘‘Resale Restriction
Termination Date’’) that is one year after the later of the date of the Issue Date and the last date
on which the Issuer or any of its affiliates was the owner of such Notes (or any predecessor
thereto) only (i) to the Issuer, the Guarantors or any subsidiary thereof, (ii) pursuant to a
registration statement that has been declared effective under the U.S. Securities Act, (iii) for so
long as the Notes are eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A, to a person it reasonably
believes is a QIB that purchases for its own account or for the account of a QIB to whom notice
is given that the transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A, (iv) pursuant to offers and
sales that occur outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S, or (v) pursuant to
any other available exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act,
subject in each of the foregoing cases to any requirement of law that the disposition of its
property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their
control and in compliance with any applicable state securities laws, and any applicable local
laws and regulations, and further subject to the Issuer’s and the Trustee’s rights prior to any
such offer, sale or transfer (I) pursuant to clause (iv) or (v) to require the delivery of an opinion of
counsel, certification and/or other information satisfactory to each of them and (II) in each of the
foregoing cases, to require that a certificate of transfer in the form appearing on the reverse of
the security is completed and delivered by the transferor to the Trustee. The foregoing
restrictions on resale will not apply subsequent to the Resale Restriction Termination Date.

Each purchaser acknowledges that each Note will contain a legend substantially to the
following effect:

THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN AND WILL NOT BE REGISTERED UNDER THE U.S.
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE ‘‘U.S. SECURITIES ACT’’), OR THE
SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION. NEITHER THIS SECURITY
NOR ANY INTEREST OR PARTICIPATION HEREIN MAY BE OFFERED, SOLD, ASSIGNED,
TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED, ENCUMBERED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF IN THE
ABSENCE OF SUCH REGISTRATION OR UNLESS SUCH TRANSACTION IS EXEMPT FROM,
OR NOT SUBJECT TO, THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT.

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

The Issuer of the Notes is organized under the laws of England and Wales. The Security Documents
relating to the Collateral will be governed by the laws of England and Wales, Germany, Ireland, Jersey
and Poland, as applicable. The Indenture (including the Guarantees) and the Notes will be governed by
New York law. The Intercreditor Agreements will be governed by the law of England and Wales. All of the
directors and executive officers of the Issuer and each of the Guarantors are non-residents of the United
States. Since substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and each of the Guarantors, and its and their
directors and executive officers, are located outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the
United States against the Issuer or a Guarantor or any such other person, including judgments with
respect to the payment of principal, premium (if any) and interest on the Notes or any judgment of a U.S.
court predicated upon civil liabilities under U.S. federal or state securities laws, may not be collectible in
the United States. Furthermore, although the Issuer and each of the Guarantors will appoint an agent for
service of process in the United States and will submit to the jurisdiction of New York courts, in each
case, in connection with any action in relation to the Notes and the Indenture or under U.S. securities
laws, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process on us or on such other persons as
mentioned above within the United States in any action, including actions predicated upon the civil
liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws.

If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against the Issuer or a Guarantor or a security provider, investors
will need to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant company has assets. Even though
the enforceability of U.S. court judgments outside the United States is described below for the countries
in which each of the Issuer and the Guarantors is located, you should consult with your own advisors in
any pertinent jurisdictions as needed to enforce a judgment in those countries or elsewhere outside the
United States.

**England and Wales**

The following discussion sets out the position with respect to the enforceability of certain U.S. court
judgments in England and Wales and is based upon advice provided to us by our English counsel. The
United States and the United Kingdom do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of court judgments in civil and commercial matters. A judgment rendered by any federal or
state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal
securities law, would not be directly enforceable in England and Wales but such judgment would be
treated as constituting a cause of action against the judgment debtor in England and Wales and could
be sued on summarily in the English courts. The English courts should enter judgment against the
judgment debtor without re-examination of the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court
provided:

- the relevant U.S. court had jurisdiction to give the judgment;

- the judgment is final and conclusive on the merits and is for a definite sum of money (not being a
sum payable in respect of taxes or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a fine or other
penalty or otherwise based on a U.S. law that an English court considers to be a penal, revenue or
other public law);

- the judgment is not for multiple damages (as defined by the Protection of Trading Interests Act
1980);

- the enforcement of such judgment would not contravene public policy in England and Wales;

- the enforcement of such judgment is not prohibited by statute (including, without limitation, if the
amount of the judgment has been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum
assessed as compensation for the loss or damage sustained);

- the English proceedings were commenced within six years after the date of the judgment;

- before the date on which the U.S. court gave judgment, the issues in question had not been the
subject of a final judgment of an English court or of a court of another jurisdiction whose judgment is
enforceable in England; and

- the judgment has not been obtained by fraud or in proceedings, which are in breach of the
principles of natural justice;

245


-----

It is uncertain whether an English court would impose liability on a judgment debtor in an action
predicated upon the U.S. federal securities law brought in England and Wales.

If an English court gives judgment for the sum payable under a U.S. judgment, the English judgment will
be enforceable by methods generally available to the English courts for this purpose. These methods
generally permit the court discretion to prescribe the manner of enforcement. In addition, it may not be
possible to obtain an English judgment or to enforce that judgment if the judgment debtor is subject to
any insolvency or similar proceedings, or if the judgment debtor has any set-off or counterclaim against
the judgment creditor.

**Germany**

We have been advised by our German counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of
civil liabilities based on federal or state securities laws of the United States, either in an original action or
in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. federal or state courts. The United States and the
Federal Republic of Germany currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently,
a final judgment for payment given by any federal or state court in the United States, whether or not
predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable,
either in whole or in part, in Germany. A conclusive judgment by a U.S. federal or state court, however,
may be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction in
accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure
(Zivilprozessordnung). In such an action, a German court generally will not reinvestigate the merits of the
original matter decided by a U.S. court, except as noted below. The recognition and enforcement of the
U.S. judgment by a German court is conditional upon a number of factors, including the following:

- U.S. courts could take jurisdiction of the case in accordance with the principles of jurisdictional
competence according to German law;

- the document introducing the proceedings was duly made known to the defendant in a timely
manner that allowed for adequate defense;

- the judgment is not contrary to (i) any prior judgment which became res judicata rendered by a
German court or (ii) any prior judgment which became res judicata rendered by a foreign court
which is recognized in Germany and the procedure leading to the respective judgment does not
contradict any such prior judgment;

- the effects of its recognition will not be in conflict with material principles of German law, including,
without limitation, fundamental rights under the constitution of Germany (Grundrechte). In this
context, it should be noted that any component of a U.S. federal or state court civil judgment
awarding punitive damages or any other damages which do not serve a compensatory purpose,
such as treble damages, will not be enforced in Germany. They are regarded to be in conflict with
material principles of German law;

- the reciprocity of enforcement of judgments is guaranteed; and

- the judgment became res judicata in accordance with the law of the place where it was pronounced.

Enforcement and foreclosure based on U.S. judgments may be sought against German defendants after
having received an enforcement decision from a competent German court in accordance with the above
principles. Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce judgments in Germany in civil and
commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that
those judgments will be enforceable. Enforcement is also subject to the effect of any applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation, moratorium as well as other similar laws affecting
creditors’ rights generally. In addition, it is doubtful whether a German court would accept jurisdiction
and impose civil liability in an original action predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.

Furthermore, German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of
aspects. With respect to the production of evidence, for example, U.S. federal and state law and the laws
of several other jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which
parties to the proceedings may, prior to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third
parties and the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the
outcome of any proceeding. No such pre-trial discovery process exists under German law.

246


-----

If the party in whose favor such final judgment is rendered brings a new suit in a competent court in
Germany, such party may submit to the German court the final judgment rendered in the United States.
Under such circumstances, a judgment by a federal or state court of the United States against the Issuer
or such persons will be regarded by a German court only as evidence of the outcome of the dispute to
which such judgment relates. A German court may choose to re-hear the dispute and may render a
judgment not in line with the judgment rendered by a federal or state court of the United States.

**Ireland**

As the United States is not a party to a convention with Ireland in respect of the enforcement of
judgments, common law rules apply in order to determine whether a judgment of the courts of the State
of New York is enforceable in Ireland. Awards of punitive damages in actions brought in the United States
or elsewhere may not be enforceable in Ireland. Judgments of the U.S. courts will not be directly
enforceable in Ireland and any proceedings in respect of any action would need to be taken before the
Irish courts. However, a judgment of a U.S. court may be recognized and enforced in Ireland without
retrial or examination of the merits of the case, provided that:

- the U.S. judgment has not been obtained or alleged to have been obtained by fraud or trick;

- the decision of the U.S. court and the enforcement thereof was not and would not be contrary to
natural or constitutional justice under the laws of Ireland;

- the U.S. judgment and the enforcement thereof would not be contrary to public policy as
understood by the Irish courts or constitute the enforcement of a judgment of a penal or revenue
(tax) nature;

- the U.S. judgment is final and conclusive and is for a debt or definite sum of money;

- the procedural rules of the U.S. courts and the Irish courts have been observed;

- the judgment is not inconsistent with a judgment of the Irish courts in respect of the same matter;
and

- the Irish enforcement proceedings being commenced within six years from the date of the
U.S. judgment, or such other period as may be applicable pursuant to the Irish Statute of Limitations
1957 (as amended).

**Jersey**

The following summary with respect to the enforceability of certain U.S. court judgments in Jersey is
based upon advice provided to us by Jersey legal advisors. As a general rule, foreign judgments,
including judgments predicated upon civil liabilities and any judgment obtained in courts outside of
Jersey predicated upon U.S. Federal securities laws, cannot be directly enforced in Jersey, although an
exception to this rule occurs where the Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) (Jersey) Law 1960 (as
amended) (the ‘‘1960 Law’’) applies.

The 1960 Law provides for the registration and enforcement in Jersey of judgments given in the superior
courts of countries which accord reciprocal treatment to judgments given in Jersey. Presently, the
reciprocating countries and their superior courts are as follows:

- England and Wales—The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, the House of Lords, the Court of
Appeal and the High Court of Justice;

- Scotland—The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, the Court of Session and the Sheriff Court;

- Northern Ireland—The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, and the Court of Judicature of
Northern Ireland;

- Isle of Man—Her Majesty’s High Court of Justice of the Isle of Man (including the Staff of
Government Division); and

- Guernsey—The Royal Court of Guernsey and the Court of Appeal of Guernsey.

Not all judgments given by such superior courts can be registered. The registration procedure set out in
Part 2 of the 1960 Law applies only to judgments or orders given or made in civil proceedings, or in
criminal proceedings for the payment of a sum of money in respect of compensation or damages to an
injured party. It does not apply to judgments given by such superior courts on appeal from an inferior

247


-----

court nor, for example, to an English County Court judgment given in proceedings later transferred to the
High Court for enforcement. In addition, the judgment must:

- be final and conclusive as between the parties (whether or not an appeal in the foreign court is
pending or possible);

- provide for the payment of a sum of money, but not in respect of taxes or similar charges, or a fine or
other penalty;

- be for a moneys sum which has not been wholly satisfied; and

- be able to be enforced by execution.

Further detailed provisions in relation to the enforcement of foreign judgments in Jersey are contained in
the 1960 Law. If a foreign judgment falls within Part 2 of the 1960 Law, the judgment creditor must use the
registration procedure, as further described in the 1960 Law.

Where registration under the 1960 Law, is not available, it will be necessary for a holder of a foreign
judgment to commence fresh proceedings in Jersey. While such proceedings would seek to sue on the
foreign judgment as a debt and seek summary judgment in respect thereof, the proceedings might
involve a re-examination of the merits of the case (such re-examination to be carried out in accordance
with relevant principles of private international law).

In summary, to enforce a foreign judgment in personam at common law, the judgment must be final and
conclusive, for a debt or definite sum of money (but not payable in respect of taxes or similar charges or
a fine or other penalty), and given by a court of competent jurisdiction, but must not be impeachable on
the grounds of fraud, or contrary to public policy, or natural justice. In Jersey, it has been held that a final
and conclusive non-monetary judgment obtained in the courts of any territory deemed to have
jurisdiction in accordance with the principles of private international law as applied by Jersey law, may in
appropriate circumstances be recognized and enforced by the Jersey court without a substantive
re-examination of the merits—there is currently no strict judicial guidance as to what could constitute
appropriate circumstances.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in Jersey judgments in civil and commercial
matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that
those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in Jersey. In addition, it is questionable whether a
Jersey court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in
Jersey, instead of the United States, and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.

**Poland**

Recognition and enforcement of judgments of foreign courts is subject to:

(1) the Council Regulation (EC) No. 44/2001 of December 22, 2000 on jurisdiction, recognition and
enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters;

(2) the 2007 Lugano Convention on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in
civil and commercial matters;

(3) Agreement between the European Community and the Kingdom of Denmark on jurisdiction and the
recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (OJ L79, 21.03.2013,
page 4).

(4) other relevant treaties or conventions, including relevant bilateral treaties; and

(5) the rules of the Polish Code of Civil Procedure of November 17, 1964 (Dz.U.1964.43.296 as
amended) (the ‘‘Polish Code of Civil Procedure’’).

There is no treaty between the United States and Poland providing for the reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) rendered in civil and commercial matters.
Therefore, the rules of the Polish Code of Civil Procedure shall apply to recognition and enforcement of
U.S. court judgments.

Pursuant to the Polish Code of Civil Procedure, a foreign court judgment is recognized ex lege in Poland,
unless one of the following circumstances occurs:

- the judgment is not final in the jurisdiction in which it was issued;

248


-----

- the judgment was issued in a case which was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Polish courts;

- the respondent, who did not engage in the dispute on the matter, was not provided with summons
initiating the proceedings, in due manner and time, to allow such respondent to take defense;

- a party has been deprived of the opportunity to defend itself in the proceedings;

- the proceeding relating to the same claim and between the same parties commenced in Poland
(before a court or other relevant agency) prior to the commencement of the proceeding before a
court of the foreign country;

- the judgment is contrary to any earlier final judgment of a Polish court (or other relevant agency) or
any earlier final judgment of a foreign court (or other relevant agency) satisfying the conditions for its
recognition in Poland, which was issued regarding the same claim between the same parties; and

- the recognition of the judgment would be contrary to the fundamental principles of the legal order of
the Republic of Poland.

Any person who has the so-called legal interest may apply to Polish court with a motion for a decision
ascertaining that the judgment of a foreign court is or is not recognized in Poland.

The judgment of a foreign court, which is eligible to be enforced, can be enforced in Poland after its
enforceability is confirmed by the Polish court. Polish court will confirm the enforceability if:

- the judgment of a foreign court is enforceable in the jurisdiction in which it was issued; and

- none of the circumstances referred to above (relating to the recognition of the judgments) occurs.

Certain judgments of U.S courts (or parts thereof) may be unenforceable or not fully enforceable by
Polish courts, or their enforcement can be difficult in practice, in particular: (i) certain forms of specific
performance, in particular those which are not recognized or common in Poland, (ii) certain forms (or
amounts) of damages or indemnities, in particular, punitive damages or other similar damages or
indemnities the amount of which exceeds the actual loss suffered. Judgments (or parts thereof)
adjudicating such forms of specific performance or damages or indemnities may be considered as
contrary to the fundamental principles of the legal order of the Republic of Poland.

Enforcement is also subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
liquidation, moratorium as well as other similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally.

**LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE**
**COLLATERAL AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS**

_Set out below is a summary of certain limitations on the enforceability of the Guarantees and the security_
_interests relating to the Notes, and of certain insolvency law considerations in each of the jurisdictions in_
_which the Issuer, the Guarantors and the providers of security are organized or incorporated. It is a_
_summary only. Bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or a similar event could be initiated in any of these_
_jurisdictions and/or in the jurisdiction of organization or incorporation of a future guarantor under the_
_Notes. The application of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which_
_jurisdictions’ law should apply and could adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights and to collect_
_payment in full under the Notes, the Guarantees and any security securing the Notes._

**EU insolvency law**

The Issuer and certain Guarantors are organized or incorporated under the laws of EU Member States.
Pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) no. 1346/2000 on insolvency proceedings (the ‘‘EU Insolvency
Regulation’’), the court that shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in relation to a
company is the court of the EU Member State (other than Denmark) where the company concerned has
its ‘‘center of main interests’’ (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation). The
determination of where any such company has its ‘‘center of main interests’’ is a question of fact on
which the courts of the different EU Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. The
term ‘‘center of main interests’’ is not a static concept. Although there is a rebuttable presumption under
Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that any such company has its ‘‘center of main interests’’ in
the EU Member State in which it has its registered office, Preamble 13 of the EU Insolvency Regulation
states that the ‘‘center of main interests’’ of a debtor should correspond to the place where the debtor
conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and ‘‘is therefore ascertainable by third
parties.’’ In that respect, factors such as where board meetings are held, the location where the
company conducts the majority of its business and the perception of the company’s creditors as regards
to the center of the company’s business operations may all be relevant in the determination of the place
where the company has its ‘‘center of main interests.’’

If the ‘‘center of main interests’’ of a company is and will remain located in the state in which it has its
registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under the EU Insolvency
Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would
be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU
Insolvency Regulation with these proceedings being governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the local
laws of the court opening such main insolvency proceedings. Insolvency proceedings opened in one EU
Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized automatically in the other EU
Member States (other than Denmark). If the ‘‘center of main interests’’ of a debtor is in one EU Member
State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another EU
Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open ‘‘territorial proceedings’’ only in the event
that such debtor has an ‘‘establishment’’ in the territory of such other EU Member State. If the main
insolvency proceedings have been opened by the court of the EU Member State where the center of
main interests of the debtor is situated, and are outstanding, then the territorial proceedings (entitled
‘‘secondary’’ proceedings) can only be winding-up proceedings. If no such main insolvency
proceedings are outstanding, the territorial proceedings could still be opened in another EU Member
State (except Denmark) under certain circumstances as set forth in Article 3(4) of the EU Insolvency
Regulation. The effects of those territorial proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated
in the territory of such other EU Member State. If the company does not have an establishment in any
other EU Member State, no court of any other EU Member State has jurisdiction to open territorial
proceedings in respect of such company under the EU Insolvency Regulation. In the event that any one
or more of the Issuer, the Guarantors or any of their subsidiaries experience financial difficulty, it is not
possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings
would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the
enforceability of the obligations and the security of the Issuer and the Guarantors.

**Germany**

**_German Insolvency Proceedings_**

Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency
court ex officio, but require that the debtor and/or a creditor file a petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings (Antrag auf Er¨offnung des Insolvenzverfahrens). Insolvency proceedings must be initiated
by the debtor and can be initiated by a creditor in the event of over-indebtedness (Uberschuldung[¨] ) of the
debtor or in the event of illiquidity (Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit).

A debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets unless, based on the prevailing
circumstances, a continuation of the business is predominantly likely (¨uberwiegend wahrscheinlich).

A company is considered to be illiquid if it is unable to pay its debts when they are due. In addition, only
the debtor can file for the opening of insolvency proceedings in case of impending illiquidity (drohende
_Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit), if there is the imminent risk for the Issuer of being unable to pay its debts as and_
when they fall due, whereas impending illiquidity does not give rise to an obligation for the management
of the debtor to file for insolvency proceedings.

If a GmbH (Gesellschaft mit beschr¨ankter Haftung), a German stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft), a
European law stock corporation based in Germany (Societas Europaea—‘‘SE’’) or any other company
not having an individual as a personally liable shareholder gets into a situation of illiquidity and/or
over-indebtedness, the managing director(s) of such company must file a petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings without undue delay but in any event no later than three weeks after such
company has become illiquid and/or over-indebted. The management of a debtor can be exposed to
criminal sanctions as well as damage claims in the event that filings for insolvency are delayed or not
made at all.

If a company faces imminent illiquidity and/or is over-indebted it may also file for a preliminary ‘‘debtor in
possession’’ protection scheme unless—from a third party perspective—there is no reasonable chance
of a successful restructuring. In such case and upon request of the debtor, the court will appoint a
preliminary trustee (vorl¨aufiger Sachwalter) and prohibit enforcement measures (other than with respect
to immoveable assets). It may also implement other preliminary measures to protect the debtor from
creditor enforcement actions for up to three months. During that period, the debtor must prepare an
insolvency plan which will ideally be implemented in formal ‘‘debtor-in-possession’’ proceedings
(Eigenverwaltung) after formal insolvency proceedings have been opened.

The insolvency proceedings are court-controlled, and, upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the
insolvency court may take preliminary protective measures to secure the property of the debtor during
the preliminary proceedings (Insolvenzer¨offnungsverfahren). The court may prohibit or suspend any
measures taken to enforce individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary
proceedings. As part of such protective measures the court may appoint a preliminary insolvency
administrator (vorl¨aufiger Insolvenzverwalter). The rights and duties of the preliminary administrator
depend on the decision of the court. The duties of the preliminary administrator may be, in particular, to
safeguard and preserve the debtor’s property and to assess whether the debtor’s net assets will be
sufficient to cover the costs of the insolvency proceedings. Depending on the decision of the court, even
the right to manage and dispose of the business and assets of the debtor may pass to the preliminary
insolvency administrator. This only applies, where the debtor has not applied for so-called
self-administration (Eigenverwaltung), in which event the court will only appoint a preliminary trustee
(vorl¨aufiger Sachwalter), who will supervise the management of the affairs by the debtor.
During preliminary insolvency proceedings, a ‘‘preliminary creditors’ committee’’ (vorl¨aufiger
_Gl¨aubigerausschuss) generally will be appointed by the court if the debtor satisfies two of the following_
three requirements:

- a balance sheet total in excess of e4,840,000 (after deducting an equity shortfall if the debtor is
over-indebted),

- revenues of at least e9,680,000 in the 12 months prior to the last day of the financial year preceding
the filing; and/or

- 50 or more employees on an annual-average basis.

The requirements apply to the entity subject to the proceedings without taking into account the assets of
other group companies. The preliminary creditors’ committee will be able to participate in certain

251


-----

important decisions taken during the preliminary insolvency proceedings. It will, for example, have the
power to influence the following: the selection of a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorl¨aufiger
_Insolvenzverwalter) or an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter), orders for ‘‘self-administration’’_
proceedings (Anordnung der Eigenverwaltung), and the appointment of a preliminary trustee (vorl¨aufiger
_Sachwalter). The court opens formal insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzer¨offnung) if certain formal_
requirements are met (in particular, but not limited to, evidence being provided of an existing cause of
insolvency) and there are sufficient assets to cover at least the cost of the insolvency proceedings. If the
assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only open main insolvency
proceedings if third parties, for instance creditors, advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such
advancement, the petition for opening of insolvency proceedings will usually be refused for insufficiency
of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse).

Upon the opening of the insolvency proceedings, an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) is
usually appointed by the court who has full administrative and disposal authority over the debtor’s
assets unless debtor-in-possession (Eigenverwaltung) are ordered. The insolvency administrator may
raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s operations or may
deem it necessary to wind down the Issuer. Satisfaction of these liabilities as preferential debts of the
estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) will be preferred to any insolvency liabilities created by the debtor prior
to the opening of insolvency proceedings.

For the holders of the Notes, the most important consequences of such opening of formal insolvency
proceedings against a company subject to the German insolvency regime would be the following:

- the right to administer and dispose of assets of the Issuer would generally pass to the insolvency
administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative of the insolvency estate;

- if the court does not order debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), disposals effected
by management of the Issuer after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings are null and void
by operation of law;

- if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings, a creditor in the
insolvency proceedings acquires through execution (e.g., attachment) a security interest in part of
the debtor’s property that would normally form part of the insolvency estate, such security becomes
null and void by operation of law upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings; and

- claims against the Issuer may generally only be pursued in accordance with the rules set forth in the
German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung).

Any person that has a right to segregation (Aussonderung), i.e., the relevant asset of this person does
not constitute part of the insolvency estate, does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim
for segregation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency
administrator.

All other creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to segregate an asset from
the insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht) as opposed to a preferential right (Absonderungsrecht))
who wish to assert claims against the debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings. Any
individual enforcement action brought against the debtor by any of its creditors other than creditors with
preferred claims (Absonderung der Masseverbindlichkeit) is subject to an automatic stay once the
insolvency proceedings have been opened (and, if so ordered by a court, also between the time when
an insolvency petition is filed and the time when insolvency proceedings commence). Unsecured
creditors may file their claims in the insolvency proceedings and will be paid on a pro rata basis from the
insolvency estate (to the extent sufficient assets are available). Certain secured creditors have
preferential rights regarding the enforcement of their security interests, but German insolvency law
imposes certain restrictions on their ability to enforce their security interests outside the insolvency
proceedings and in many cases the insolvency administrator will have the sole right to enforce the
security. Whether or not a secured creditor remains entitled, after the initiation of insolvency
proceedings, to enforce security granted to it by the relevant debtor depends on the type of security.

The insolvency administrator generally has the sole right (a) to realize any moveable assets within its
possession which are subject to preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) (e.g., pledges over movable
assets and rights (Mobiliarpfandrechte) transfer by way of security (Sicherungs¨ubereignung)) as well as
(b) to collect any claims that are subject to security assignment agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). If
such enforcement right is vested in the insolvency administrator, the enforcement proceeds, less certain

252


-----

contributory charges for (a) assessing the value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten) and
(b) realizing the secured assets (Verwertungskosten) which, in the aggregate, usually add up to 9% of
the gross enforcement proceeds (plus VAT (if any)), are paid to the creditor holding the relevant security
interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. The unencumbered assets
of the debtor serve to satisfy the costs of the insolvency proceeding (Massekosten) first and afterwards
the preferred creditors of the insolvency estate (Massegl¨aubiger). Typically, liabilities resulting from acts
of the insolvency administrator after commencement of formal insolvency proceedings constitute
liabilities of the insolvency estate. Thereafter, all other claims (insolvency claims (Insolvenzforderungen)),
in particular claims of unsecured creditors, will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there is
cash remaining in the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse). A different distribution of enforcement
proceeds can be proposed in an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) that can be submitted by the debtor or
the insolvency administrator and which requires, among other things and subject to certain exceptions,
the consent of the debtor and the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority
rules.

Under German insolvency laws, it is possible to implement a debt-to-equity swap through an insolvency
plan. However, it will not be possible to force a creditor into a debt-to-equity swap with regards to the
debt owed to it by the debtor if it does not consent to such swap. Creditors secured by pledges over
shares in subsidiaries of the debtor are entitled to preferential satisfaction with regard to the proceeds
realized in an enforcement process which has to be effected by means of a public auction outside the
insolvency process. However, in the absence of authoritative case law, it is uncertain whether the
secured creditors are entitled to initiate the enforcement process in respect of the pledged shares on
their own or, as far as the pledged assets are part of any insolvency estate, whether the insolvency
administrator has standing to realize the pledges on behalf of and for the benefit of the secured creditors.
Even if the law vests the right of disposal regarding the relevant collateral in the insolvency administrator,
the secured creditor retains the right of preferred satisfaction with regard to the disposal proceeds
(Absonderungsrecht). Consequently, the enforcement proceeds minus certain contributory charges as
described above are paid to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an
amount equal to its secured claims. Remaining amounts will be allocated to the insolvency estate
(Insolvenzmasse) and would, after deduction of the costs of the insolvency proceedings (as described
above) and after satisfaction of certain preferential liabilities be distributed among the non-preferential
unsecured creditors, including, to the extent their claims exceed the enforcement proceeds of the
security interests, the holders of the Notes. If a German subsidiary or a subsidiary subject to German
insolvency proceedings grants security over its assets to creditors other than the holders of the Notes,
such security may result in a preferred treatment of creditors secured by such security. The proceeds
resulting from such collateral securing creditors other than the holders of the Notes may not be sufficient
to satisfy the holders of the Notes under the Guarantees granted by the German Guarantors after
satisfaction of such secured creditors.

The right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) may not necessarily prevent the
insolvency administrator from using a moveable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency
administrator, however, must compensate the creditor for any loss of value resulting from such use. It
may take several years before an insolvency dividend, if any, is distributed to unsecured creditors. An
alternative distribution of enforcement proceeds can be proposed in an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan)
that can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and requires, in principle, the
consent of the debtor and the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority
rules.

Under German insolvency law, there is no consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of
companies in the event of insolvency. In the case of a group of companies, each entity, from an
insolvency law point of view, has to be dealt with separately (i.e., there is no group insolvency concept
under German insolvency law). As a consequence, there is, in particular, no pooling of claims among the
respective entities of a group, but rather claims of and vis-`a-vis each entity have to be dealt with
separately.

Other than secured and unsecured creditors, German insolvency law provides for certain creditors to be
subordinated by law (in particular, but not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of
the relevant debtor for the return of funds or payment of a consideration), while claims of a person who
becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings generally
rank senior to the claims of regular, unsecured creditors. Powers of attorney granted by the relevant
debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective upon the opening of insolvency

253


-----

proceedings. Certain executory contracts become unenforceable at such time unless and until the
insolvency administrators opts for performance.

**_Limitation on Enforcement_**

Any security (including a guarantee) granted by a German Guarantor being a direct or indirect
subsidiary of the Issuer incorporated in Germany in the form of a GmbH (limited liability company) or
a GmbH & Co. KG (limited partnership with a limited liability company as general partner) is subject to
certain provisions of the German Limited Liability Company Act (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften
_mit beschr¨ankter Haftung—‘‘GmbHG’’)._

As a general rule, sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG (‘‘Sections 30 and 31’’) prohibit a GmbH from
disbursing its assets to its (direct or indirect) shareholders to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s,
or in the case of a GmbH & Co. KG, its general partner’s net assets determined in accordance with the
provisions of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) (i.e., assets minus liabilities and
liability reserves) is or would fall below, or increases or would increase an existing shortfall of, the amount
of its stated share capital (Begr¨undung oder Vertiefung einer Unterbilanz). Guarantees and any other
security granted by a GmbH or by a GmbH & Co. KG in order to secure the liabilities of a direct or indirect
parent or sister company are considered disbursements under Sections 30 and 31. Therefore, in order
to enable German subsidiaries to secure the liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company
without the risk of violating Sections 30 and 31 and to protect management from personal liability, it is
standard market practice for credit agreements, indentures, guarantees and security documents to
contain so-called ‘‘limitation language’’ in relation to subsidiaries in the legal form of a GmbH or
a GmbH & Co. KG incorporated or established in Germany. Pursuant to such limitation language, the
beneficiaries of the guarantees or security interest agree to enforce the guarantees or security interest
against the German subsidiary only to the extent that such enforcement would not result in the GmbH’s
(or, in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, its general partner’s) net assets falling below, or increasing an existing
shortfall of, its stated share capital (provided that the determination and calculation of such shortfall is
subject to certain adjustments and exemptions). Accordingly, any security and Guarantee provided by a
(direct or indirect) subsidiary of the Issuer in the legal form of a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG incorporated
or established in Germany will contain such limitation language in the manner described. This could lead
to a situation in which the respective Guarantee or security granted by a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG
cannot be enforced at all. German capital maintenance rules are subject to evolving case law. Future
court rulings may further limit the access of a shareholder to assets of its subsidiaries constituted in the
form of a GmbH (or of a GmbH & Co. KG, the general partner or general partners of which is or are
a GmbH), which can negatively affect the ability of the German (direct or indirect) subsidiaries of the
Issuer to make payments under the Guarantees, of the beneficiaries of the Guarantees to enforce the
Guarantees or of the secured parties to enforce the collateral.

Furthermore, the validity and enforceability of any security and guarantee granted by a German
Guarantor being a direct or indirect subsidiary of the Issuer incorporated in Germany in the form of a
stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft—‘‘AG’’) or of any subsidiary of the AG are subject to certain
provisions of the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz—‘‘AktG’’).

As a general rule, section 71a of the AktG prohibits an AG (and any of its subsidiaries) from making any
advance payment, granting any loan, any security (including any guarantee) or any other benefit to any
other person for the purpose of the (direct or indirect) acquisition of any shares in the AG. According to
section 71a of the AktG any transaction or agreement providing for any such financial assistance would
be held void. In addition, section 57 of the AktG prohibits an AG generally from disbursing its assets to its
(direct or indirect) shareholders. Therefore, in order to enable an AG and subsidiaries of an AG to
guarantee the liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating
sections 57 and 71a of the AktG and to protect management from personal liability, it is standard market
practice for credit agreements, Indenture, guarantees and security documents to contain so-called
‘‘limitation language’’ in relation to subsidiaries in the legal form of an AG incorporated in Germany and
any of the AG’s subsidiaries. Pursuant to such limitation language, the guarantees or security interests
do not—in the absence of a domination (Beherrschungsvertrag) and/or profit and loss pooling
agreement (Gewinnabf¨uhrungsvertrag) between the AG as dominated entity and its shareholder as
dominating entity—secure any liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company of the AG (or of
any of its subsidiaries). If such domination and/or profit and loss pooling agreement is in place, further
limitations may apply with respect to such ‘‘up-stream’’ or ‘‘cross-stream’’ guarantees or security
interests by reference to the shareholder’s obligation to compensate losses of the AG under the profit

254


-----

and loss pooling agreement and its ability to satisfy its obligation. Accordingly, any security and
Guarantee provided by a (direct or indirect) subsidiary of the Issuer in the legal form of an AG
incorporated in Germany and any subsidiary of the AG will contain such limitation language in the
manner described. This could lead to a situation in which the respective Guarantee or security granted
by an AG or by any of the AG’s subsidiaries does not secure any liabilities of a direct or indirect
shareholder or of any sister company of an AG and/or cannot be enforced at all. German capital
maintenance and financial assistance rules are subject to evolving case law. Future court rulings may
further limit the access of a shareholder to assets of its subsidiaries constituted in the form of an AG (or of
the subsidiaries of an AG), which could negatively affect the ability of (direct or indirect) subsidiaries of
the Issuer constituted in the form of an AG (or of the subsidiaries of an AG) to make payments under the
Guarantees, of the beneficiaries of the Guarantees to enforce the Guarantees or of the secured parties to
enforce the collateral.

**_Parallel Debt; Security Interests_**

Under German law, certain ‘‘accessory’’ security interests such as pledges (Pfandrechte) require that the
pledgee and the creditor of the secured claim be the same person. Such security interests cannot be
held for the benefit of a third party by a pledgee which does not itself hold the secured claim. The holders
of interests in the Notes from time to time will not be parties to the security documents. In order to permit
the holders of the Notes from time to time to benefit from pledges granted to the security agent under
German law, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of a ‘‘parallel debt.’’ Pursuant to such
parallel debt, the security agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to the sum of any amounts payable
by any obligors under, in particular, the Notes and the Indenture (the ‘‘Parallel Debt Obligation’’). The
pledges governed by German law will directly and exclusively secure the Parallel Debt Obligation, rather
than secure the obligations under the Notes or the Noteholders directly. The Parallel Debt Obligation is in
the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations of the Issuer and the Security
Providers under the Notes and the Guarantees (the ‘‘Principal Obligations’’), and any payment in respect
of the Principal Obligations will discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt Obligation and any payment
in respect of the Parallel Debt Obligation will discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations.
Although the security agent will have, pursuant to the parallel debt, a claim against the Issuer and the
Security Providers for the full principal amount of the Notes, there are no published court decisions
confirming the validity of the parallel debt structure and of the pledges granted under German law to
secure such parallel debt, and hence there is no certainty that German courts will uphold such pledges.
Therefore, the ability of the security agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted. In addition, holders
of the Notes bear some risk associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the security agent.

German law does not generally permit the appropriation of pledged assets by the pledgee upon
enforcement of the pledge. The enforcement of a share pledge under German law usually requires the
sale of the asset constituting the collateral through a formal process involving a public auction to which
certain waiting periods and notice requirements apply. Under German law, it is unclear whether the
security interest in the collateral gives the security agent the right to prevent other creditors of the entities
having granted such security from foreclosing on and realizing the asset constituting the collateral.
Some courts have held that certain types of security interests only give their holders priority (according
to their ranking) in the distribution of any proceeds from the realization of the asset constituting the
collateral and no right to intervene (i.e., the right to request the court to impose a stay on proceedings
initiated by other creditors).

**_Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer_**

In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to a company, which would be based on and
governed by the insolvency laws of Germany, the security interests granted as well as a guarantee
provided by that entity could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator
(Insolvenzverwalter) under the rules of avoidance as set out in the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung).

On the basis of these rules, an insolvency administrator may challenge (anfechten) transactions which
are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the commencement of
insolvency proceedings. Such transactions can include the payment of any amounts to the Noteholders
as well as granting them any security interest (including guarantees). The administrator’s right to
challenge transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions during the ten-year
period prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings. If the Notes, the Guarantees or the

255


-----

security were avoided, holders of the Notes would only have a general unsecured claim in insolvency
proceedings in the amount of their original investment and the holders of the Notes would be under an
obligation to repay the amounts received by the insolvency estate or to waive such Guarantee or security
interest.

In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a transaction (Rechtsgesch¨aft) (which terms also include the
provision of security or the repayment of debt) may be avoided in the following cases:

- any act (Rechtshandlung) granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to
obtain, security or satisfaction for a debt (Befriedigung) if such act was taken (a) during the last three
months prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, provided that the
debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunf¨ahig) at the time when such act was taken and the creditor knew of
such illiquidity (or of the circumstances that imperatively suggested that the debtor was illiquid) at
such time, or (b) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if the
creditor knew of the debtor’s illiquidity or the filing of such petition (or of circumstances that
imperatively suggested such illiquidity or filing);

- any act (Rechtshandlung) granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor, to
obtain security or satisfaction for a debt to which such creditor was not entitled, or which was
granted or obtained in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was not entitled to such
security or satisfaction, if (a) such act was taken during the last month prior to the filing of the petition
for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after such filing, (b) such act was taken during the
second or third month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was illiquid at such time, or
(c) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition for the
opening of insolvency proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such
act was detrimental to the other insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of circumstances that
imperatively suggested such detrimental effect);

- a transaction (Rechtsgesch¨aft) by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors
or by which the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim
against a debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable, if it was entered into (a) during the three
months prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the debtor
was illiquid at the time of such transaction and the counterparty to such transaction knew of the
illiquidity at such time, or (b) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings
and the counterparty to such transaction knew of either the debtor’s illiquidity or such filing at the
time of the transaction;

- any act (Rechtshandlung) by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor
grants security or a guarantee for a third-party debt, which might be regarded as having been
granted gratuitously (unentgeltlich)), if it was effected in the four years prior to the filing of the
petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings;

- any act (Rechtshandlung) performed by the debtor during the ten years prior to the filing of the
petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing, if the debtor acted
with the intent to prejudice its insolvency creditors and the other party knew of such intention at the
time of such act;

- any non-gratuitous contract concluded between the debtor and a related party of the debtor which
directly operates to the detriment of the creditors can be avoided unless such contract was
concluded more than two years prior to the filing for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the
other party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors; in terms of
corporate entities, the term ‘‘related party’’ includes, subject to certain limitations, members of the
management or supervisory board, shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share
capital, persons or companies holding comparable positions that give them access to information
about the economic situation of the debtor, and other persons that are spouses, relatives or
members of the household of any of the foregoing persons;

- any act (Rechtshandlung) that provides security or satisfaction for a shareholder loan
(Gesellschafterdarlehen) made to the debtor or a similar claim if (a) in case of the provision of
security, the act took place during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition, or (b) in the case of satisfaction, the act
took place during the last year prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings or after the filing of such petition; and

256


-----

- any act (Rechtshandlung) whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an
economically equivalent claim to a third party if (a) the transaction was effected in the last year prior
to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter, and (b) a
shareholder of the debtor had granted security or was liable as a guarantor (B¨urge) (in which case
the shareholder has to compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)).

In this context, ‘‘knowledge’’ is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from
which the conclusion must be drawn that the debtor was unable to pay its debts generally as they fell
due, that a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was
detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. A person is
deemed to have knowledge of the debtor’s intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors if it knew of the
debtor’s imminent illiquidity and that the transaction prejudiced the debtor’s creditors. With respect to a
‘‘related party,’’ there is a general statutory presumption that such party had ‘‘knowledge.’’ Furthermore,
even in the absence of an insolvency proceeding, a third-party creditor who has obtained an
enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) but has failed to obtain satisfaction of its enforceable claims by a
levy of execution, under certain circumstances, has the right to void certain transactions, such as the
payment of debt and the granting of security pursuant to the German Code on Avoidance
(Anfechtungsgesetz). The conditions for avoidance under the German Code on Avoidance differ to a
certain extent from the above-described rules under the German Insolvency Code and the avoidance
periods are calculated from the date when a creditor exercises its rights of avoidance in the courts.

In addition, under German law, a creditor who provided additional, or extended existing, funding to a
debtor or obtained security from a debtor may be liable in tort if such creditor was aware of the debtor’s
(impending) insolvency or of circumstances indicating such debtor’s (impending) insolvency at the time
such funding was provided or extended or such security was granted. The German Federal Supreme
Court (Bundesgerichtshof) held that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor was to act with the
intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the
legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the
transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the debtor as the grantor of the guarantee or
security was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto.

**Ireland**

Pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation, the place of the registered office of a company is presumed to
be its ‘‘center of main interests’’ in the absence of proof to the contrary. Certain of the Guarantors are
incorporated under the laws of Ireland. Therefore, any main insolvency proceedings in respect of any
Irish Guarantor would likely be commenced and conducted in accordance with the requirements of Irish
insolvency laws. However, pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation, where an Irish company conducts
business in another member state of the European Union, the jurisdiction of the Irish courts may be
limited if the company’s center of main interests is found to be in another Member State (please see ‘‘—
_EU insolvency law’’). There are a number of factors that are taken into account to ascertain the centre of_
main interests. The center of main interests should correspond to the place where the company
conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and is therefore ascertainable by third
parties. The point at which the center of main interests of a particular company falls to be determined is at
the time that the relevant insolvency proceedings are opened.

The following is a general discussion of insolvency proceedings and other matters governed by Irish law
for informational purposes only and does not address all the Irish legal considerations that may be
relevant to holders of the Notes.

**_Fixed and Floating Charges_**

Under Irish law, there are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has an advantage over floating
charge security:

(a) an examiner (see ‘‘—Examinership’’) appointed to the charging company can deal with floating
charge assets;

(b) a fixed charge, even if created after the date of a floating charge, may have priority as against
the floating charge over the charged assets;

257


-----

(c) general costs and expenses (including the liquidator’s remuneration) properly incurred in a
winding-up are payable out of the company’s assets (including the assets that are the subject
of the floating charge) in priority to floating charge claims;

(d) until the floating charge security crystallizes, a company is entitled to deal with assets that are
subject to floating charge security in the ordinary course of business, meaning that such assets
can be effectively disposed of by the charging company so as to give a third-party good title to
the assets free of the floating charge and so as to give rise to the risk of security being granted
over such assets in priority to the floating charge security;

(e) floating charge security is subject to certain challenges under Irish insolvency law (please see
‘‘—Grant of Floating Charge’’); and

(f) floating charge security is subject to the claims of preferential creditors in a winding-up (such as
certain taxes, occupational pension scheme contributions and salaries owed to employees
(subject to a cap per employee) and holiday pay owed to employees).

Under Irish law there is a possibility that a court could recharacterize fixed security interests purported to
be created by a security document as floating charges; the description given to security interests by the
parties is not determinative. Whether security interests labeled as fixed will be upheld as fixed security
interests rather than floating security interests will depend on, among other things, whether the chargee
has the requisite degree of control over the relevant chargor’s ability to deal in the relevant assets and
the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the chargee in practice. Where the
chargor is free to deal with the secured assets without the consent of the chargee prior to crystallization,
the court is likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge,
notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge in the security documents. In addition, to the
extent that any of the assets which are expressed to be subject to a fixed charge are not specifically
identified, the court may hold that such assets are, in fact, subject to a floating charge.

**_Preferred Creditors under Irish Law_**

Under Section 285 of the Irish Companies Act 1963 (the ‘‘1963 Act’’), in a winding-up of an Irish company
certain preferential debts are required to be paid in priority to all debts other than those secured by a
fixed charge. Preferential debts therefore have priority over debts secured by a floating charge. If the
assets of the relevant company available for the payment of general creditors are insufficient to pay the
preferential debts, they are required to be paid out of the property subject to the floating charge. Under
Section 98 of the 1963 Act, the holder of a floating charge, or a receiver appointed by such a holder, who
takes possession of property subject to the floating charge when the company is not in the course of
being wound up, is required to pay the preferential debts out of that property in priority to principal and
interest secured by the floating charge.

Such preferential debts would comprise, among other things, any amounts owed in respect of local
rates and certain amounts owed to the Irish Revenue Commissioners for income/corporation/capital
gains tax, value added tax (VAT), employee-related taxes, social security and pension scheme
contributions and remuneration, salaries and wages of employees and certain contractors and the
expenses of liquidation.

In addition, there is a further limited category of super-preferential creditors which take priority, not only
over unsecured creditors and holders of floating security, but also over holders of fixed security. These
super-preferential claims include the remuneration, costs and expenses properly incurred by any
examiner of the company which may include any borrowings made by an examiner to fund the
company’s requirements for the duration of his appointment that have been approved by the Irish
courts, (see ‘‘—Examinership’’ below) and any capital gains tax payable on the disposition of an asset of
the company by a liquidator, receiver or mortgagee in possession.

Furthermore, and as referred to above (see ‘‘—Fixed and Floating Charges’’), in the case of the
application of moneys arising from the realization of secured assets that are subject to a floating charge,
or in a winding-up, the costs of the liquidation and the liquidator’s fees will take priority over the claims of
floating chargeholders in respect of relevant assets.

**_Examinership_**

Examinership is a court procedure available under the Irish Companies (Amendment) Act 1990, as
amended (the ‘‘1990 Amendment Act’’) to facilitate the survival of the whole or part of an Irish company
or companies in financial difficulties. In circumstances where an Irish company is or is likely to be unable
to pay its debts, then that company, the directors of that company, a contingent, prospective or actual
creditor of that company, or shareholders of that company holding, at the date of presentation of the
petition, not less than one-tenth of the voting share capital of that company are each entitled to petition
the court for the appointment of an examiner to that company. Provided the company can demonstrate
viability, and can satisfy certain tests, the Irish High Court appoints an independent examiner whose
function is to supervise the restructuring process.

Where the Irish High Court appoints an examiner to a company, it may, at the same or any time thereafter,
make an order appointing the examiner to be examiner for the purposes of the 1990 Amendment Act to a
related company of such company. Once confirmed by the Irish High Court the scheme is binding on the
company and all its members and creditors. During the protection period the day-to-day business of the
company remains under the control of the directors of the company, subject to certain rights of the
examiner to apply to the Irish High Court. The examiner, once appointed, has the power to set aside
contracts and arrangements entered into by the company after this appointment and, in certain
circumstances, can avoid a negative pledge given by the company prior to this appointment.
Furthermore, the examiner may sell assets of the company which are the subject of security. Where such
assets are the subject of a fixed security interest, the examiner must account to the holders of the fixed
security interest for the amount realized and discharge the amount due to the holders of the fixed
security interest out of the proceeds of the sale.

During the period of protection, the examiner will formulate proposals for a compromise or scheme of
arrangement to assist the survival of the company, or of a related company, or both, and the whole or any
part of its or their undertaking as a going concern. A scheme of arrangement may be approved by the
Irish High Court when at least one class of creditors who would be adversely affected by the scheme of
arrangement has voted in favor of the proposals and the Irish High Court is satisfied that such proposals
are (i) fair and equitable in relation to any class of members or creditors who have not accepted the
proposals and whose interests would be impaired by implementation of the scheme of arrangement and
(ii) not unfairly prejudicial to the interests of any interested party.

For as long as a company is under the protection of the Irish High Court, no attachment, sequestration,
distress or execution shall be put into force against the property or effects of the relevant company
except with the consent of the examiner. In addition, no proceedings of any sort may be commenced
against a guarantor or any other person liable to pay all or any part of the debts of the company under
protection in respect of the debts of that company. This moratorium under the 1990 Amendment Act runs
for an initial period of 70 days from the date of the presentation of the petition to the court for the
appointment of the examiner. An extension of up to 30 days can be granted on application to the court by
the examiner and the period may be further extended by the court for such period as the court considers
necessary to decide whether or not to confirm the proposals.

_Primary Risks for Holders of Notes in an Examinership_

The primary risks to the holders of the Notes, under the laws of Ireland, if an examiner were appointed to
an Irish Guarantor and/or to a company related to such an Irish company and where any amounts due
under the Notes were unpaid, are as follows:

(a) there may be a delay in enforcing the payment obligations of an Irish Guarantor of the Notes
and of any payment obligations contained in a guarantee given by any other related company
subject to the examinership proceedings;

(b) the potential for a compromise or scheme of arrangement being approved involving the writing
down or rescheduling of the debt due by an Irish Guarantor to the holders of the Notes;

(c) the potential for a compromise or scheme of arrangement being approved involving the writing
down or rescheduling of any payment obligations owed to the holders of the Notes by a
company related to such an Irish Guarantor;

259


-----

(d) the potential for the examiner to seek to set aside any negative pledge prohibiting the creation
of security or the incurring of borrowings by the Irish Guarantor to enable the examiner to
borrow to fund the guarantor during the protection period; and

(e) in the event that a scheme of arrangement is not approved in respect of an Irish company
guarantor of the Notes and the guarantor subsequently goes into liquidation, the examiner’s
remuneration and expenses (including certain borrowings incurred by the examiner on behalf
of the guarantor and approved by the Irish High Court) will take priority over the moneys and
liabilities which from time to time are or may become due, owing or payable by it to the holders
of the Notes.

**_Challenges to Security_**

There are circumstances under Irish insolvency law in which the granting by an Irish company of security
can be challenged. In most cases this will only arise if an examiner or a liquidator is appointed to the Irish
company within a specified period (as set out in more detail below) of the granting of the security and, in
addition, the company was ‘‘unable to pay its debts’’ when the security interest was granted or ‘‘unable
to pay its debts’’ as a result.

A company will be ‘‘unable to pay its debts’’ if a statutory demand for an amount over e1,270
(approximately) is served on the company and remains unsatisfied for three weeks or an execution order
or other process issued on a judgment, decree or order of a court in favor of a creditor is returned
unsatisfied in whole or in part or it is proved to the court’s satisfaction that the company is not able to pay
its debts as they fall due or that the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities
(taking into account contingent and prospective liabilities).

The following potential grounds for challenge may apply to security interests:

_Fraudulent Preference_

Under Irish insolvency law, if an Irish company goes into liquidation, a liquidator may apply to the court
for an order to set aside certain transactions entered into by an Irish company before the
commencement of liquidation on the grounds that such transaction constituted a fraudulent preference.
Section 286 of the 1963 Act provides that any conveyance, mortgage, delivery of goods, payment,
execution or other act relating to property made or done by or against a company which is unable to pay
its debts as they become due, to any creditor, within six months of the commencement of a winding-up
of the Irish company, with a view to giving such creditor (or any surety or guarantor of the debt due to
such creditor) a preference over its other creditors shall, if the company is at the time of the
commencement of the winding-up unable to pay its debts (taking into account the contingent and
prospective liabilities), be deemed a fraudulent preference of its creditors and be invalid accordingly.
Where the conveyance, mortgage, delivery of goods, payment, execution or other action is in favor of a
connected person the six-month period is extended to two years.

_Transaction Defrauding Creditors_

Under Section 139 of the Irish Companies Act 1990, if in a liquidation, receivership or examination of an
Irish company it can be shown to the satisfaction of the court that any property of such company of any
kind whatsoever was disposed of either by way of conveyance, transfer, mortgage, security, loan or in
any way whatsoever whether by act or omission, direct or indirect, and that the effect of such disposal
was to perpetrate a fraud on the Irish company, its creditors or members, the court may, if it deems it just
and equitable to do so, order any person who appears to have the use, control or possession of such
property or the proceeds of the sale or development thereof to deliver it or to pay a sum in respect of it to
the relevant insolvency officer (or other applicant, which could include a creditor or contributory) under
such terms or conditions as the court sees fit. In deciding whether it is just and equitable to make an
order under Section 139 of the Irish Companies Act 1990, the Irish High Court must have regard to the
rights of persons who have bona fide and for value acquired an interest in the property the subject of the
application. Section 139 does not apply to a disposal that would constitute a fraudulent preference for
the purpose of Section 286 of the 1963 Act.

260


-----

_Grant of Floating Charge_

Under Irish insolvency law, if an Irish company is unable to pay its debts at the time of (or as a result of)
granting a floating charge, then such floating charge can be avoided if it was granted in the period of one
year ending with the onset of insolvency (except to the extent of moneys actually advanced or paid or the
actual price or value of the goods or services sold or supplied to the Irish company at the time of or
subsequent to the creation of, and in consideration for, the charge, together with interest on that amount
at the rate of 5% per annum). Where the floating charge is granted to a ‘‘connected person’’ the charge
can be challenged if granted within two years of the onset of insolvency.

_General_

If an Irish Guarantor becomes subject to an Irish law insolvency proceeding and that company has
obligations to creditors that are treated under Irish law as senior relative to the company’s obligations to
the Noteholders, the Noteholders may suffer losses as a result of their subordinated status during such
insolvency proceeding.

The validity and enforceability of a guarantee or security interest may be contested on the basis of an
_ultra vires claim. It is important in this regard that any Guarantor incorporated under the laws of Ireland_
has sufficient powers in its Memorandum of Association to give guarantees and indemnities and to
create security over its assets.

Subject to certain exceptions, under Section 60 of the 1963 Act, it is unlawful for an Irish company to
give, whether directly or indirectly, and whether by means of a loan, guarantee, the provision of security
or otherwise, any financial assistance for the purpose of or in connection with a purchase or subscription
made or to be made by any person or for any shares in the company or its holding company.

Pursuant to Section 1001 of the Irish Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, the holder of a fixed security over
book debts of an Irish tax-resident company may be required by notice from the Irish Revenue
Commissioners to pay to them sums equivalent to those which the holder thereafter receives in payment
of debts due to it by the relevant company. Where the holder of the security has informed the Irish
Revenue Commissioners of the creation of the security within 21 days of its creation, the holder’s liability
is limited to the amount of certain outstanding Irish tax liabilities of the company (including liabilities in
respect of value added tax) arising after the issue to the holder of a notice from the Irish Revenue
Commissioners.

The Irish Revenue Commissioners may also attach any debt due to an Irish tax-resident company by
another person in order to discharge any liabilities of the company in respect of outstanding tax whether
the liabilities are due on its own account or as an agent or trustee. It is possible that the scope of this right
of the Irish Revenue Commissioners may override the rights of holders of security (whether fixed or
floating) over the debt in question.

**_Enforcement Process_**

_Receivership_

A receiver could be appointed by way of enforcement of the right of the holders of fixed or floating
security interests. Receivers are appointed over assets which fall within the security granted, and not
over the company itself. The appointment of a receiver could result in the costs and expenses of the
receiver taking priority over any amounts otherwise owed to holders of the Notes.

_Notes Guarantees_

There is a risk that the Guarantees may be challenged as unenforceable on the basis that there is an
absence of corporate benefit on the part of an Irish Guarantor or that it is not for the purpose of carrying
on the business of the Irish Guarantor.

The directors’ primary duty is to act in the best interests of their own company and not in the interest of
the group as a whole. Nevertheless, it is often to the advantage of one company to support other
members of the group and the Irish courts have held that corporate benefit may be established where
the benefit flows to the group generally rather than specifically to the relevant Irish guarantor.

**Jersey**

**_Insolvency_**

Certain of the Guarantors, or expected future Guarantors, are incorporated under the laws of Jersey.
Consequently, in the event of an insolvency of any such Guarantors, insolvency proceedings may be
initiated in Jersey. There are two principal regimes for corporate insolvency in Jersey: _d´esastre and_
winding-up (including summary winding-up, just and equitable winding-up and creditors’ winding-up).

The principal type of insolvency procedure available to creditors under Jersey law is the application for
an Act of the Royal Court of Jersey under the Bankruptcy (D´esastre) (Jersey) Law 1990, as amended (the
‘‘Jersey Bankruptcy Law’’) declaring the property of a debtor to be ‘‘en d´esastre’’ (a ‘‘declaration’’). On a
declaration of _d´esastre, title and possession of the property of the debtor vest automatically in the_
Viscount, an official of the Royal Court (the ‘‘Viscount’’). With effect from the date of declaration, a
creditor has no other remedy against the property or person of the debtor, and may not commence or
continue any legal proceedings to recover the debt (except with the consent of the Viscount or the Royal
Court).

Additionally, the shareholders of a Jersey company (but not its creditors) can instigate a winding-up of
an insolvent company, which is known as a ‘‘creditors’ winding-up’’ pursuant to Chapter 4 of Part 21 of
the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, as amended (the ‘‘Jersey Companies Law’’). On a creditors’
winding-up, a liquidator is appointed, usually by the creditors. The liquidator will stand in the shoes of the
directors and administer the winding up, gather assets, make appropriate disposals of assets, settle
claims and distribute assets as appropriate. After the commencement of the creditors’ winding-up, no
action can be taken or continued against the company except with the leave of the Royal Court. The
corporate state and capacity of the company continues until the end of the winding-up procedure, when
the company is dissolved. The Jersey Companies Law requires a creditor of a company (subject to
appeal) to be bound by an arrangement entered into by the company and its creditors immediately
before or in the course of its winding-up if (inter alia) three-quarters in number and value of the creditors
acceded to the arrangement.

Alternatively, a Jersey company as the debtor may be wound up by the Royal Court (under Article 155 of
the Jersey Companies Law) if the debtor has not been declared en d´esastre and the Royal Court is of the
opinion that it is just and equitable, or expedient in the public interest, to do so. This procedure is less
common than the principal corporate insolvency procedures of a creditors’ winding-up or a d´esastre.
The application to the Royal Court for such winding-up may be made by the debtor, a director, a
shareholder, the Minister for Economic Development (the ‘‘Minister’’) or the Jersey Financial Services
Commission (the ‘‘JFSC’’) on just and equitable grounds, or by the Minister or the JFSC on public
interest grounds. The test to be applied by the Royal Court in considering the application is whether it
holds the above opinion, as opposed to a test of solvency. If the Royal Court orders a debtor to be wound
up, it may appoint a liquidator and direct the conduct of the winding-up in the court order.

**_Transactions at an Undervalue_**

Under Article 17 of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 176 of the Jersey Companies Law, the court
may, on the application of the Jersey Viscount (in the case of a company whose property has been
declared ‘‘en d´esastre’’) or liquidator (in the case of a creditors’ winding-up, a procedure which is
instigated by shareholders not creditors), set aside a transaction (including any Guarantee or security
interest) entered into by a company with any person (the ‘‘other party’’) at an undervalue. There is a
five-year look-back period from the date of commencement of the winding up or declaration of
‘‘d´esastre’’ during which transactions are susceptible to examination pursuant to this rule (the ‘‘relevant
time’’). The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Jersey Companies Law contain detailed provisions, including
(without limitation) those that define what constitutes a transaction at an undervalue, the operation of the
relevant time and the effect of entering into such a transaction with a person connected with the
company or with an associate of the company.

**_Guarantee Waivers_**

If the Courts of Jersey were asked to enforce a guarantee against a Jersey company, the Jersey
company might be able to claim certain rights under Jersey law, known as the droit de division and the
droit de discussion, being respectively essentially a right to require that any liability of that company
under a guarantee be divided or apportioned with another person or persons and a right to require that

262


-----

the assets of the principal obligor or any other person be exhausted before any claim under the
guarantee is enforced against the Jersey company. These guarantor rights can be waived by contract,
as is the case under the Guarantees.

**_Preference_**

Under Article 17A of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 176A of the Jersey Companies Law, the court
may, on the application of the Viscount (in the case of a company whose property has been declared ‘‘en
_d´esastre’’) or liquidator (in the case of a creditors’ winding-up), set aside a preference (including any_
Guarantee or security interest) given by the company to any person (the ‘‘other party’’). There is a
12-month look-back period from the date of commencement of the winding-up or declaration of
‘‘d´esastre’’ during which transactions are susceptible to examination pursuant to this rule (the ‘‘relevant
time’’). The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Jersey Companies Law contain detailed provisions, including
(without limitation) those that define what constitutes a preference, the operation of the relevant time and
the effect of entering into a preference with a person connected with the company or with an associate of
the company.

**_Extortionate Credit Transactions_**

Under Article 17C of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 179 of the Jersey Companies Law, the court
may, on the application of the Viscount (in the case of a company whose property has been declared ‘‘en
_d´esastre’’) or liquidator (in the case of a creditors’ winding-up), set aside a transaction providing credit to_
the debtor company which is or was extortionate. There is a three-year look-back period from the date of
commencement of the winding-up or declaration of ‘‘d´esastre’’ during which transactions are
susceptible to examination pursuant to this rule (the ‘‘relevant time’’). The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and
Jersey Companies Law contain detailed provisions, including (without limitation) those that define what
constitutes a transaction which is extortionate.

**_Disclaimer of Onerous Property_**

Under Article 15 of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law, the Viscount may, within six months following the date of
the declaration of d´esastre and under Article 171 of the Jersey Companies Law, a liquidator may within
six months following the commencement of a creditors’ winding up, disclaim any onerous property of
the company. ‘‘Onerous property’’ is defined to include any moveable property, a contract lease or other
immoveable property if it is situated outside of Jersey that is unsaleable or not readily saleable or is such
that it might give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act, and includes an
unprofitable contract.

A disclaimer operates to determine, as of the date it is made, the rights, interests and liabilities of the
company in or in respect of the property disclaimed and to discharge the company from all liability in
respect of the property as at the date of the commencement of the creditors’ winding-up or d´esastre, but
does not, except so far as is necessary for the purpose of releasing the company from liability, affect the
rights or liabilities of any other person. A person sustaining loss or damage as a result of a disclaimer is
deemed to be a creditor of the company to the extent of the loss or damage and shall have standing as a
creditor in the d´esastre or creditors’ winding-up. The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Jersey Companies
Law contain detailed provisions, including (without limitation) in relation to the power to disclaim
onerous property.

**_Fraudulent Dispositions_**

In addition to the Jersey statutory provisions referred to above, there are certain principles of Jersey
customary law (for example, a Pauline action) under which dispositions of assets with the intention of
defeating creditors’ claims may be set aside.

**_Floating Charges_**

Under the laws of Jersey, a person incorporated, resident or domiciled in Jersey is deemed to have
capacity to grant security governed by foreign law over property situated outside the Island of Jersey, but
to the extent that any floating charge is expressed to apply to any asset, property and undertaking of a
person incorporated, resident or domiciled in Jersey such floating charge is not likely to be held valid
and enforceable by the Courts of Jersey in respect of Jersey situs assets.

263


-----

**_Administrators, Receivers and Statutory and Non-statutory Requests for Assistance_**

The Insolvency Act 1986 (either as originally enacted or as amended, including by the provisions of the
Enterprise Act 2002) does not apply in Jersey and receivers, administrative receivers and administrators
(as provided for in the Insolvency Act 1986) are not part of the laws of Jersey. Accordingly, the Courts of
Jersey may not recognize the powers of an administrator, administrative receiver or other receiver
appointed in respect of Jersey situs assets.

However, under Article 49(1) of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law, the Jersey Royal Court may assist the courts
of prescribed countries and territories in all matters relating to the insolvency of any person to the extent
that the Jersey court thinks fit. These prescribed jurisdictions include the United Kingdom. Further, in
doing so, the Royal Court may have regard to the UNCITRAL model law, even though the model law has
not been (and is unlikely to be) implemented as a separate law in Jersey.

If the request comes from a prescribed country but not by a court-made request or from a
non-prescribed country, then common law and principles of comity will be considered by the Royal
Court by virtue of its inherent jurisdiction. If insolvency proceedings are afoot in another jurisdiction in
relation to the company, the nature and extent of the cooperation from Jersey is likely to depend on the
nature of the requesting country’s insolvency regime. If the requesting country adheres to principles of
territoriality, as opposed to universality, and, for instance, ring-fences assets for local creditors, full
cooperation is highly unlikely. If, however, the jurisdiction applies similar fundamental principles to those
applied in Jersey, the Royal Court’s approach is more likely to be similar to the position where prescribed
countries are involved.

In the case of both statutory and non-statutory requests for assistance, it should not be assumed that the
UNCITRAL provisions will automatically be followed. That is a matter for the discretion of the Royal Court.
It would also be wrong to assume for European countries that the position will be in accordance with EU
Insolvency Regulation. Jersey does not form part of the European Community for the purposes of
implementation of its directions. Accordingly, the EU Insolvency Regulation does not apply as a matter of
Jersey domestic law and the test of center of main interests does not automatically apply as a result
(although the Courts of Jersey may have regard to the concept of centre of main interests).

**_Security in Insolvency and Enforcement Procedure_**

Enforcement of Jersey security may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, dissolution,
re-organization or other laws of general application relating to or affecting the rights of creditors, but
insolvency or bankruptcy alone will not render the security interests created pursuant to Jersey security
interest agreements invalid or non-binding on the parties thereto or any liquidator of a Jersey company
or the Viscount in a _d´esastre of a Jersey company’s property. This is subject to certain statutory_
exceptions, which include (but are not limited to):

- Article 159(4) of the Jersey Companies Law provides that after the commencement of a creditors’
winding-up of a Jersey company no action shall be taken or proceeded with against the company
except by leave of the Royal Court and subject to such terms as that court may impose; and

- Article 10(1) of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law provides that with effect from the date of a declaration of
_d´esastre against a person (the ‘‘bankrupt’’), a creditor shall not have any other remedy against the_
property or person of the bankrupt or commence or (except with the consent of the Viscount or by
order of the Royal Court) continue any action or legal proceedings to recover such creditor’s debt.

In relation to any Jersey law security interest agreements (the ‘‘Jersey SIAs’’), upon the occurrence of an
Event of Default (as defined in each of the Jersey SIAs), the secured party may exercise the power of sale
over the collateral specified in the Jersey SIAs and apply the sale proceeds in accordance with the
provisions of Article 8 of the Security Interests (Jersey) Law 1983. The Security Interests (Jersey) Law
1983 does not allow for the secured party to take title to such collateral absolutely or to transfer the
collateral to itself in settlement of the secured obligations other than in relation to collateral that is money
or represented by a negotiable instrument or moneys held in a bank account. Further, the Security
Interests (Jersey) Law 1983 provides that such power of sale (including any appropriation of money, a
negotiable instrument or moneys in a bank account) can only be exercised once the secured party has
served notice on the debtor specifying the Event of Default and, where such default is capable of
remedy, requiring the debtor to remedy it. In cases where the Event of Default is capable of remedy, the
secured party cannot exercise the statutory power of sale until the expiry of a 14 day period following the
service of such notice.

264


-----

- In relation to the Jersey SIAs, under Article 6(4) of the Security Interests (Jersey) Law 1983, on a
_d´esastre of the property of a debtor, the Viscount may apply to the Royal Court of Jersey for an order_
vesting in him the rights of the secured party to the collateral subject to a security interest pursuant
to the Security Interests (Jersey) Law 1983 (including the power of sale under such law) and
directing that it be sold. The proceeds of sale, following deduction of the Viscount’s costs (in
accordance with his usual practice), will be applied in meeting the secured obligations under any
security interests existing in respect of such collateral, according to the priority set out in the
Security Interests (Jersey) Law 1983. In our view, the Viscount is most likely to make such
application to the Royal Court of Jersey if the secured party is acting in a way that the Viscount
considers detrimental to the conduct of the _d´esastre, for example, by the secured party being_
dilatory in exercising his power of sale under the Security Interests (Jersey) Law 1983.

- In relation to the Jersey SIAs, on a d´esastre, the Viscount will automatically take title to the assets of
the debtor, subject to any pre-existing rights in respect of such assets. This has the consequence
that the Viscount may need to be involved to effect the exercise of the statutory power of sale of
assets secured by way of possession pursuant to Article 2(3) of the Security Interests (Jersey) Law
1983. Article 32(7) of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law provides that, where any property of a debtor is
subject to a security interest created pursuant to the Security Interests (Jersey) Law 1983, the
proceeds of sale are to be applied in the manner set out in Article 8(6) of that Law. Article 8(6)
provides for the costs and expenses of the sale to be deducted first from the proceeds of such sale,
following which the proceeds would be applied to satisfy those obligations secured under the
Security Interests (Jersey) Law 1983 in order of priority according to date of creation. However,
where the Viscount is required to be involved in the sale of the secured assets because he holds title
following a d´esastre, the Viscount has, as a matter of practice, sought to claim his fees (which are
currently approximately 10% of the value of realized assets and 2.5% of the value of distributed
assets) from such proceeds of sale.

In the enforcement of foreign security in Jersey, the Royal Court—properly applying the relevant
provisions of foreign law—is likely to uphold (subject to the comments above) a claim that the relevant
security interest (and other than in respect of any property or assets situated or deemed to be situated in
Jersey) is binding on a Jersey company and any liquidator or other similar person having control of the
assets of a Jersey company.

A transfer of shares in a Jersey company, not being a transfer made to or with the sanction of the
liquidator of the company in a creditors’ winding-up (insolvent winding-up) under the Jersey Companies
Law, or the Viscount after the property of the company is declared to be en d´esastre under the Jersey
Bankruptcy Law, and an alteration in the status of the company’s members made after the
commencement of the creditors’ winding-up or after such declaration of en d´esastre, is void.

**Poland**

**_Insolvency_**

The Issuer’s obligations under the Notes are or will be guaranteed by certain Guarantors incorporated in
Poland (the ‘‘Polish Guarantors’’). If a Guarantor’s centre of main interests is in Poland, then pursuant to
the Polish Bankruptcy and Rehabilitation Law of February 28, 2003 (Dz.U. 2012.1112 as amended) (the
‘‘Polish Bankruptcy Law’’) and the EU Insolvency Regulation, the main bankruptcy proceedings of that
Guarantor should be conducted before a Polish court. The EU Insolvency Regulation states that the
place of the registered office is presumed to be the center of its main interests, in the absence of proof to
the contrary. Consequently, in the event of the insolvency of a Polish Guarantor, bankruptcy proceedings
would be governed by Polish law if its centre of main interests is in Poland. Any judgment opening
insolvency proceedings granted by a Polish court will be recognized in all other European Union
member states (except for Denmark) from the time that judgment becomes effective in Poland.
Recognition of these bankruptcy proceedings will not preclude the opening of secondary bankruptcy
proceedings, as described in more detail above.

According to the Polish Bankruptcy Law, the grounds for declaring bankruptcy of a debtor which is a
commercial company are as follows:

(1) it does not fulfill its due and payable pecuniary obligations (wymagalne zobowi˛azania
_pieni˛e˙zne), and/or_

265


-----

(2) its obligations (zobowi˛azania) exceed the total value of its assets (maj˛atek), even if it discharges
those obligations on a current basis.

Each individual who has the right to represent the Polish Guarantor (whether alone or with others) is
obliged to file a motion to declare the Polish Guarantor bankrupt within two weeks from the day the
grounds listed above for declaring bankruptcy are met. In practice, it is difficult to determine the day from
which the two week time limit for filing the motion should be counted.

Additionally, each of the Polish Guarantor’s creditors may file for bankruptcy of the relevant Polish
Guarantor.

There are two types of bankruptcy proceedings under Polish law:

‘‘liquidation’’ bankruptcy, the principal aim of which is to satisfy creditors from the proceeds
obtained from the sale of the debtor’s assets (such bankruptcy would result in dissolution of the
debtor’s company, unless otherwise permitted by law); and

‘‘arrangement’’ bankruptcy, which are essentially aimed at satisfying creditors through a
settlement approved by the required majority of creditors and the court (such bankruptcy could
allow the debtor to continue its business activity following the completion of these
proceedings).

_Liquidation bankruptcy_

In the event of liquidation bankruptcy, the court appoints a bankruptcy receiver (syndyk) who takes over
the management of the bankrupt’s assets. From this moment on, the receiver and not the debtor (the
bankrupt entity) administers the bankrupt entity’s assets and represents the bankrupt entity. The
bankrupt entity’s assets become bankruptcy assets which will be liquidated to pay off creditors. The
receiver prepares a list of the assets. On the declaration of bankruptcy, all of the debtor’s debts become
due and payable. Interest may be paid from the bankruptcy estate only for the period up to the date of
the declaration of bankruptcy, unless they are secured by mortgages, pledges, registered pledges,
treasury pledges and/or maritime pledges, and satisfied from the security assets’ proceeds.

_Arrangement bankruptcy_

The arrangement bankruptcy proceedings are conducted with respect to the debtor, where it has been
credibly established that the creditors’ claims will be satisfied in a greater extent than they would be in
liquidation bankruptcy proceedings, unless, given the debtor’s behavior to date, it is uncertain whether
the arrangement will be fulfilled, which will not be relevant if the arrangement proposals include a
liquidation arrangement.

In the event of arrangement bankruptcy proceedings, the court appoints a court supervisor (nadzorca
s˛adowy) or an administrator (zarz˛adca) instead of the bankruptcy receiver. A court supervisor is
appointed in situations where the debtor will continue to manage its assets, whereas an administrator is
appointed when the debtor is deprived of the right to manage its assets.

If the required majority of creditors vote in favor of an arrangement, the arrangement is accepted and
then approved by the court, unless the arrangement is contrary to the rules of law or it is obvious that it
will not be performed. The court’s decision approving the arrangement may be appealed. The accepted
arrangement is binding on (affects) all creditors whose receivables are covered by the arrangement in
accordance with the provisions of the Polish Bankruptcy Law. Certain receivables are not covered
(affected) by the arrangement. These include, inter alia:

(1) receivables secured with mortgages, pledges, registered pledges, treasury pledges and/or
maritime pledges (to the extent they can be satisfied from a security asset); a creditor whose
claims are so secured may, however, consent to being subject to an arrangement;

(2) receivables under derivative or repo transactions; and

(3) receivables under employment contracts.

The rules under which the bankrupt entity’s debts will be repaid are stipulated in the arrangement.

The most common arrangement involves the debtors paying only a portion of the debts and/or deferral
of payments of such debts, and the bankrupt entity continuing its operations. It is also possible, however,

266


-----

to accept a liquidation arrangement where a determination is made as to how the bankrupt entity’s
assets and the business will be liquidated.

The court may change the manner of conducting the bankruptcy proceedings from the arrangement
bankruptcy proceedings into the liquidation proceedings and vice versa, if the grounds for conducting a
given type of the proceedings become known after the declaration of bankruptcy.

_Other bankruptcy-proceeding issues_

Once bankruptcy is declared (irrespective of its type), no mortgage, pledge, registered pledge, treasury
pledge and/or maritime mortgage can be established over the bankrupt entity’s assets in order to secure
a receivable debt which arose before the declaration of bankruptcy. This does not apply to a mortgage
where a motion to enter a mortgage was filed with the court at least six months before the filing of the
bankruptcy petition.

Provisions of a contract which provide, in the event of a declaration of bankruptcy, for amendments to, or
termination of, a legal relationship to which the bankrupt entity is a party, are invalid. A provision of a
contract to which the bankrupt entity is a party which renders the achievement of the goal of the
bankruptcy proceedings impossible or difficult are ineffective against the bankruptcy estate.

If court proceedings against the bankrupt entity are pending on the day of the bankruptcy declaration in
any common courts, then such proceedings are in some cases discontinued. If proceedings were
pending in which the bankrupt entity was the plaintiff, the receiver or the administrator replaces the
bankrupt entity. If a court supervisor is appointed, it would act together with the bankrupt entity in the
proceedings. If enforcement proceedings regarding the receivables included in the arrangement by
operation of law, in the case of arrangement bankruptcy, and any receivables which may be filed within
the bankruptcy proceedings, in the case of liquidation bankruptcy, were pending against the bankrupt
entity on the date of the bankruptcy declaration, they are suspended with effect from the date of the
bankruptcy declaration and the proceeds received are transferred to the bankruptcy estate after the
decision on the declaration of bankruptcy becomes final.

All the arbitration clauses expire with effect from the date of the bankruptcy declaration and if arbitration
proceedings were pending on the date of the bankruptcy declaration, such proceedings are
discontinued.

Creditors have a right to submit their claims within the time limit indicated in a decision declaring
bankruptcy. Claims supported by evidence of claims are usually admitted, i.e., included in the list of
liabilities. If a filed claim is not included in the list, then a creditor has a right to appeal. The procedural
requirements for submitting a claim are very formalistic.

Any debt (claim) payable in a currency other than złoty, regardless of whether the claim has fallen due or
not, if put on the list of claims, will be expressed in złoty and the złoty equivalent is calculated on the basis
of the average exchange rate of the National Bank of Poland prevailing on the date the bankruptcy court
issues a decision on the debtor’s bankruptcy. Accordingly, in the event of bankruptcy, creditors
(e.g. holders of the Notes) may be subject to exchange rate risk between such date when the bankruptcy
court issues a decision on the debtor’s bankruptcy and the date of receipt of any amounts in the course
of bankruptcy liquidation.

In the case of liquidation bankruptcy, creditors under the Guarantee will be satisfied from the proceeds
obtained from the sale of a Polish Guarantor’s assets. When the repayment of receivables arising under
the Guarantee becomes part of an arrangement in arrangement bankruptcy proceedings, there is a
possibility that such receivables may be decreased on the basis of a decision of the creditors (such
decisions would be subject to certain mandatory rules of the Polish Bankruptcy Law). The proceeds
separated to satisfy a receivable whose repayment depends on a condition precedent will be handed
over to the creditor if the creditor can prove that the condition has been fulfilled; otherwise this amount
will be deposited with the court. The proceeds separated to satisfy a receivable which is not yet due and
payable shall be deposited with the court.

As a rule, creditors’ receivables towards a Polish Guarantor will be divided into five categories and
creditors having their receivables in a lower ranking category may not obtain satisfaction before all
receivables in the higher ranking category have been fully satisfied. Any unsecured debt under bonds or
credit falls into category four, provided that any unpaid interest under such bonds or credit are included
in that category only for a period of one year before the bankruptcy declaration and for any previous

267


-----

period they fall into category five. The first three categories, which rank ahead of category four, concern,
inter alia, the following receivables:

(1) the costs of bankruptcy proceedings;

(2) payments due under employment contracts for the period before the date of the declaration of
bankruptcy; and

(3) payments to the state, such as taxes and social security obligations for employees.

Within each category, each receivable is satisfied pro rata to the total value of receivables listed in such
category.

If an asset owned by the bankrupt entity (i.e., a Polish Guarantor) is subject to a mortgage, pledge,
registry pledge, treasury pledge or a maritime mortgage, then a creditor in whose favor the security has
been established has a right to receive proceeds from the sale of that asset before the other creditors
(with a few exceptions relating to mortgages and maritime mortgages such as, for instance, a certain
portion of alimony claims or employee salaries). Where a number of mortgages have been established
on a real estate which considerably exceed its value, creditors are repaid from such real estate
according to their priority set out in the land and mortgage register maintained for that real estate.

It is not clear whether Polish courts and/or an administrator (zarz˛adca) and/or court supervisor (nadzorca
_s˛adowy) and/or a bankruptcy receiver (syndyk) (unless otherwise specifically stated, hereinafter the term_
‘‘administrator’’ shall include each one of zarz˛adca, nadzorca s˛adowy and/or syndyk) will give effect to
provisions on subordination in intercreditor agreements. There is a risk that in the course of insolvency
proceedings claims of all unsecured creditors will be discharged on a pari passu basis, irrespectively of
any provisions on subordination in intercreditor agreements, and the creditors who are the parties to
such agreements may have to enforce their rights thereunder only outside of the insolvency
proceedings (e.g. by claiming the return of particular amounts from other creditors who are the parties to
such agreements).

**_Security under Polish law in general_**

Under Polish law, in general, all security interests, including, without limitation, mortgages and pledges,
are considered accessory to the underlying secured claims, i.e. security interest, including in particular,
without limitation, the mortgages and pledges automatically terminate if the secured claims are repaid,
become void or terminate. See also ‘‘—Parallel Debt’’ below.

The establishment of certain security interests in Poland requires the execution of appropriate
documents and entry into registers or filings with relevant courts. The establishment of the mortgages on
real estate in Poland (if such is to be established) will require the execution of a deed before a Polish
notary public and submission to and entry (registration) of each mortgage in the land and mortgage
register held by the Polish court. The establishment of the pledges will require execution of the pledge
agreements and, with respect to registered pledges, the entry (registration) of each registered pledge in
the pledge register held by the Polish court.

The process of registration of mortgages and/or registered pledges may take up to several months and,
until they are completed, the mortgages and/or registered pledges will not legally exist. Once they are
registered, the statutory priority of the mortgages and/or registered pledges will be determined by the
priority of the filing motions for the registration thereof. In respect of certain rights, such as shares and
bank accounts, on which the registered pledges are to be established, the payment obligations under
the Notes will be secured additionally by financial pledges, which however may not give the same scope
of rights to the secured creditors as the registered pledges.

As a general rule, the establishment of the pledges (registered and financial) or mortgages over the
assets of a Polish Guarantor will not prevent third party creditors from initiating enforcement proceedings
under the Polish Code of Civil Procedure to satisfy their claims from the assets encumbered by the
pledges or mortgages. In such event, the Security Agent will be able to participate in the distribution of
funds resulting from such enforcement and its claims will have priority over unsecured claims of third
parties (except for certain court enforcement expenses, alimony claims and employee and pension
claims) and claims secured with the lower ranking pledges or mortgages according to the order of
priorities set forth in accordance with the Polish Code of Civil Procedure.

268


-----

In respect of the registered or financial pledges, the Security Agent will have the right to satisfy claims
secured with such pledges by assuming title to the pledged assets on the terms set out in the respective
pledge agreements. Regarding the registered pledges, it would be also possible for the Security Agent
to satisfy its claims by selling such assets in an auction made by a notary public or a court enforcement
officer in priority of other creditors. In respect of the registered pledges on the so-called collection of
assets, the Security Agent will have the right to satisfy claims secured with such pledges also by leasing
the pledgor’s enterprise to a third party or handing-over such enterprise to a receiver (a manager).
However, if any third party creditor initiates enforcement proceedings to satisfy their claims from the
assets encumbered by such pledges, the Security Agent will not be able to exercise any such specific
method of enforcement of the registered pledges (by taking the title to the encumbered assets, by sale of
such assets via an auction made by a notary public or a court enforcement officer, and in the event of
pledges established on the collection of assets and rights, also by leasing the pledgor’s enterprise to a
third party or handing-over such enterprise to a receiver (a manager)), but only be entitled to
enforcement of such pledges via a standard court enforcement process which is usually considered as
more time-consuming and more expensive for the secured creditor. Additionally, in insolvency
proceedings, the bankruptcy receiver retains the discretion to prevent the Security Agent from acquiring
title to the pledged assets or from sale of such assets via an auction made by a notary public or a court
enforcement officer or may even refrain from liquidating (selling) such encumbered assets separately,
and may sell the entire business of the bankrupt entity (entire bankruptcy estate) as a going concern, if
he/she considers that such sale would be more commercially beneficial.

Polish law does not recognize the enterprise pledge/mortgage (i.e., one security interest over the whole
business of an entity). In particular, without limitation, mortgages on real estate and pledges on movable
assets or transferrable rights or the assignments of such rights are separate security interests from which
the secured creditors have to satisfy separately. The result of this is that in the enforcement process the
sale of the whole business of an entity that provided security interests over its assets as a going concern
may be impossible in practice (this limitation does not apply to the bankruptcy trustee to sell the entire
business of the bankrupt entity (entire bankruptcy estate) as a going concern if such a sale would be
more commercially beneficial—see above).

In the event of enforcement of a pledge on shares in a Polish company, not only do the Polish regulations
relating to the pledge apply, but also the provisions of Polish company law with respect to transfer of
shares have to be adhered to. Further, the pledge over shares will be of limited economic value when the
company whose shares are pledged becomes insolvent.

The security established for the benefit of the Security Agent in Poland includes the establishment of
both financial pledges and registered pledges over the same assets. The co-existence of registered and
financial pledges established as encumbrances over a single asset, securing the same claim, is not
expressly provided for under the Polish law and we cannot assure you that the validity of the coexisting
registered and financial pledges established in favor of the bank creditors and the Security Agent would
not be subject to challenge, for example, under concepts of over collateralization and/or violation of
principles of social co-existence.

It is prohibited under Polish law to make a covenant under which the owner of the real property
undertakes to a creditor secured by mortgage on such real property that it shall not dispose of or
encumber such property before the expiration of the mortgage.

The mortgages secure claims up to a given amount stated in the respective notarial deeds. If any such
mortgage is considered as excessive (over-collateralization), the owner of the property so encumbered
may request that the mortgage amount be reduced.

The Polish mortgage law was subject to a major amendment which entered into force on February 20,
2011. In particular, one of the changes was the introduction of the concept of over-collateralization to the
Polish mortgage law. There is no case law or practice in respect of these new rules. It is uncertain how
these new rules of the Polish mortgage law will be interpreted by Polish courts or how these new rules
law and their interpretation will affect the other provisions of Polish law (for example, with respect to a
registered pledge).

**_Polish Law on the Acquisition of Real Estate by Foreigners_**

Under the Polish Law on the Acquisition of Real Estate by Foreigners (Ustawa o nabywaniu
_nieruchomo´sci przez cudzoziemc´ow), the acquisition of real estate in Poland or the acquisition of shares_
in a Polish company which owns real estate in Poland or any other action through which such Polish

269


-----

company becomes controlled by a foreign entity, in certain situations requires a permit from the Polish
Ministry of Internal Affairs and Administration (an ‘‘MOI Permit’’). The Polish Law on the Acquisition of
Real Estate by Foreigners provides for a number of exemptions from the duty to obtain the MOI Permit. In
particular, such duty is waived with respect to persons domiciled in countries which are members of the
European Economic Area. However, these exemptions are not absolute and they do not apply to certain
types of real estates. Pursuant to the provisions of the Law on the Acquisition of Real Estate by
Foreigners, if a Polish Guarantor hold, or acquire, land which may be purchased by persons domiciled in
European Union member states only subject to prior receipt of an MOI Permit, an acquisition, by the
Security Agent or by other entities, of shares in such Polish Guarantor in the course of enforcement of the
pledges established on such shares, or an acquisition, by the Security Agent or by other entities, of real
estate in the course of enforcement of the mortgages, may also require such an MOI Permit.

Pursuant to the Polish Competition Act of February 16, 2007 (Dz.U.2007.50.331, as amended) (the
‘‘Competition Act’’), taking control over an entrepreneur by way of, among other things, an acquisition of
shares and/or any part of its assets and/or an acquisition of a right to exercise voting rights of shares in
such entrepreneur, may require prior approval of the President of the Polish Competition Authority
and/or antimonopoly authorities of other countries and/or the EC. Therefore, if the Security Agent
enforces the registered pledges by way of an acquisition of title to the encumbered shares or other
assets or by exercising the voting rights in respect of shares encumbered by pledges (registered or
financial pledges), it may require prior approval(s) of the respective antimonopoly authority(ies).
Violation of the Competition Act or other respective antimonopoly laws or regulations may result in fines,
a duty to dispose of the acquired assets or other penalties.

**_Perfection requirements_**

Under Polish law, certain security interests, such as registered pledges and mortgages, will be validly
established after the fulfillment of certain perfection requirements. The registered pledge will be
established not on execution of a respective pledge agreement between the pledgor and the Security
Agent, but on entering such pledge into the registry of pledges maintained by the pertinent court. There
will be a time lapse between

(1) filing the application to enter certain security interests; and

(2) the fulfillment of additional perfection requirements.

For example, in the case of registered pledges, the time lapse typically takes from one to four weeks, in
all cases depending on a given register and provided that the applications were properly filed and paid
for. Moreover, the pledge over shares of the Polish Guarantors will become effective against the Polish
Guarantor once the Polish Guarantor is notified of the establishment of such pledge.

**_Parallel Debt_**

As stated above, security interests under Polish law are considered accessory to the underlying secured
claims. Such security interests cannot be held for the benefit of a third party by e.g. a pledgee which
does not itself hold the secured claim. The holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will not be
parties to the security documents. In order to permit the holders of the Notes from time to time to benefit
from pledges granted to the security agent under Polish law, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the
creation of a ‘‘parallel debt.’’ Pursuant to such parallel debt, the security agent becomes the holder of a
claim towards each obligor equal to the sum of any amounts payable by that obligor under, in particular,
the Notes and the Indenture (the ‘‘Parallel Debt Obligation’’). The pledges and other security interests
governed by Polish law will directly and exclusively secure the Parallel Debt Obligation, and not the
obligations under the Notes or the Indenture, and such security interests will be established not for the
benefit of holders of the Notes directly but for the benefit of the Security Agent only. The Parallel Debt
Obligation is in the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations of the Issuer and the
Guarantors under the Notes and the Guarantees (the ‘‘Principal Obligations’’), and any payment in
respect of the Principal Obligations will discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt Obligation and any
payment in respect of the Parallel Debt Obligation will discharge the corresponding Principal
Obligations. The financing structures and security interests based on the parallel debt are subject to
risks under Polish law. Polish law does not regulate expressly parallel debt and there have been no
decisions of the Supreme Court of Poland clearly recognizing such structures as parallel debt. There is
some practice in Poland in respect of establishing the security interests to secure parallel debt:
registration courts enter registered pledges and mortgages which secure parallel debts and in limited

270


-----

number of decisions the Supreme Court of Poland, in the reasoning of such decisions, indirectly
recognized the parallel debt. However, in the Polish legal system decisions of courts, including the
Supreme Court of Poland, are not source of law, the concept of parallel debt is not specifically regulated
in Polish law and the practice relating to parallel debt is still limited. Therefore, we cannot assure you that
such parallel debt, and thus the validity of the security interests securing such parallel debt, will not be
subject to challenge.

**_Effectiveness of the Guarantee and security in the case of a Polish Guarantor’s bankruptcy_**

Under the Polish Bankruptcy Law, the Guarantees and other security granted by the Polish Guarantors
may be declared ineffective or deemed to be ineffective in certain situations. In particular, establishing
security and paying an undue debt (dług niewymagalny), which was given or made by the bankrupt
entity within two months before filing the bankruptcy petition, are ineffective towards the bankruptcy
estate. However, the receiver of such payment or beneficiary of such security may, by bringing an
appropriate action or charge, seek the recognition of such acts as effective if at the time they were
performed it was unaware of the existence of grounds for declaring bankruptcy of the payer or grantor of
security.

A Guarantee or security granted within six months before the filing of the bankruptcy petition will be
ineffective towards the insolvency estate, if they were granted by the bankrupt entity to its partners or
shareholders, their representatives or spouses of the same, or affiliates, their partners or shareholders,
representatives, or spouses of the same as well as with another company, in the event of either being the
controlling company.

The Guarantees granted within one year before the filing of the motion for bankruptcy will also be
deemed ineffective towards the bankruptcy estate if the value of the Guarantees significantly exceeded
the consideration for a Polish Guarantor, or there was no consideration for a Polish Guarantor. It is not
entirely clear under the Polish Bankruptcy Law whether the Guarantees are subject to such clawback
provisions. Also, mortgages, pledges, registered pledges or maritime mortgages established in the year
preceding the bankruptcy declaration may be declared ineffective towards the bankruptcy estate by the
judge commissioner if the bankrupt entity was not a personal debtor of the secured creditor and did not
obtain any benefit whatsoever in connection with the establishment of such security interest. This rule
shall apply respectively in situations where an encumbrance was established in exchange for a
manifestly low (niewsp´ołmiernie niskie) consideration. Regardless of the value of the consideration
received by the bankrupt, the judge-commissioner will declare encumbrances ineffective towards the
bankruptcy estate if they secure debts of the bankrupt company’s partners or shareholders, their
representatives or spouses of the same, or affiliates, their partners or shareholders, representatives, or
spouses of the same as well as with another company, in the event of either being the controlling
company.

The transaction security (such as mortgages, pledges and security assignments of rights) and the
Guarantees may be affected by the provisions of Art. 527 of the Civil Code pursuant to which a
transaction effected by a debtor to the detriment of its creditors (i.e., where the debtor became insolvent
or became insolvent to a greater extent as a result of the transaction) and a third party has gained a
benefit, each of the creditors (or, if the debtor is declared bankrupt, the relevant bankruptcy officer) may
demand that the transaction be declared ineffective if:

(1) the debtor consciously acted to the creditors’ detriment, and

(2) the third party knew or, had it acted with due diligence, could have known that the debtor was
acting to the detriment of its other creditors (and the third party’s knowledge that the debtor
consciously acted to the creditors’ detriment is presumed if the entrepreneur who received the
benefit as a result of the transaction with the debtor remained in a permanent economic
relationship with such debtor).

In addition, if the Polish Guarantor’s entering into a given agreement made it wholly or partially
impossible to satisfy a third party’s claim, such third party may request that the court declare such an
agreement ineffective towards that party, provided the Polish Guarantor and the other party to the
agreement knew of the third party’s claim or if the agreement was for no consideration.

The assets, receivables and other rights transferred by the debtor for security purposes under the
assignment agreements will not be excluded from the bankruptcy estate on the debtor’s bankruptcy.
Instead, assets transferred under such assignment agreements, and claims secured by such

271


-----

assignment agreements, will be treated accordingly as assets being subject to, and claims secured by,
the pledge.

In the event that a Polish Guarantor is declared bankrupt, the receivable debts which are secured by the
pledges or mortgages established over the assets of the Polish Guarantor are placed (either upon a
motion of a creditor or ex officio) on the list of receivables. The consequences for such securities differ
depending on the way the insolvency proceedings are carried out.

In the case of the arrangement bankruptcy proceedings claims secured on the bankrupt entity’s assets
by mortgage, pledge, registered pledge or transfer of title to movables, receivables or other rights, are
not subject to arrangement to the extent covered by the value of assets on which security was
established. Notwithstanding that, a creditor whose claims are so secured may consent to being subject
to arrangement. If the creditor consents to its claims being subject to the arrangement, the above rights
remain in force; however, such rights secure the claims in the amount and on the terms as may be
changed (affected) by the arrangement. The arrangement does not infringe the rights resulting from the
mortgage or pledges, if they were established on the assets of a third party.

In the case of the liquidation bankruptcy proceedings, all assets of the debtor, including these on which
the mortgages and pledges were established, are included in the bankruptcy estate and are, in general
(see the next paragraph), subject to the sale in the course of the insolvency proceedings. Sums obtained
from the liquidation (sale) of assets encumbered with mortgages and/or pledges, less the costs of
liquidation (sale) of the said assets and other costs of insolvency proceedings capped at 10% of the sum
received from the liquidation of the security asset are allocated to satisfy the creditors whose claims were
secured on these assets. Amounts remaining after satisfaction of these claims are included in the funds
of the bankruptcy estate.

**_Other limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and security_**

Under Polish law, financial assistance restrictions apply to joint-stock companies (sp´ołki akcyjne).
Financial assistance is understood very broadly as providing by a company, directly or indirectly, any
financing for the purposes of the acquisition of shares issued by that company, inter alia by granting of
credit, loan, guarantee or security. The company may provide such financial assistance only if all of the
following conditions are specified:

(1) the financing is provided by a joint-stock company on arm’s length basis, including, without
limitation, with respect to interest payable to the company and security established in favor of
the company and after conducting by the company of a due diligence in respect of the debtor’s
financial position;

(2) the acquisition of the company’s shares, for the purposes of which the financing is provided, is
made at a fair price;

(3) the financing could only be granted up to the amount of the joint-stock company’s reserve
capital created for that purpose; such reserve capital can only be created out of funds which
can, pursuant to the applicable rules of Polish law, can be paid out as dividends;

(4) the joint-stock company’s general meeting must adopt in advance an appropriate resolution,
which must be based on a management board’s report, which must:

(a) indicate the grounds and objectives for providing such financing;

(b) confirm that the financing is in the joint-stock company’s interests; and

(c) set out terms and conditions for such financing, including the security interest granted to
the joint-stock company, a justified price as well as the risks and impact on the joint-stock
company’s solvency; and

(5) the management board’s report must be filed with the registry court and published.

Polish law does not provide specific limitations on financial assistance with respect to a limited liability
company (sp´ołka z ograniczon˛a odpowiedzialno´sci˛a). However, a Polish limited liability company should
comply with both the general corporate laws and the insolvency laws which may provide certain
limitations on the enforcement of the Guarantees.

These financial assistance restrictions may affect the Guarantees and security granted by a Polish
Guarantor which has the legal form of a joint-stock company. Additionally, in the Polish legal doctrine

272


-----

opinions are expressed that the financial assistance rules may apply (indirectly) to other companies
(also limited liability companies) if they are subsidiaries of a joint-stock company which is subject
(directly) to financial assistance rules, and therefore there is a risk that provision of financing by a
subsidiary of a joint-stock company (even if such subsidiary is not a joint-stock company but e.g. a
limited liability company) would be considered as indirect financial assistance provided by such jointstock company.

In accordance with Art. 189 sec. 2 of the Polish Commercial Companies Code, shareholders of a limited
liability company (sp´ołka z ograniczon˛a odpowiedzialno´sci˛a) may not receive any payments out of a
company’s assets which are necessary for the share capital to be fully paid up. A more general Art. 189
sec. 1 prohibits the return of capital to such shareholders. In relation to a Polish joint-stock company
(sp´ołka akcyjna), Art. 344 sec. 1 of the Polish Commercial Companies Code stipulates that no payments
for shares may be reimbursed to a shareholder, either fully or partially, except as allowed by the law for
the duration of the company’s existence. In the Polish legal doctrine opinions are expressed that in
certain situations, for example when the financial standing of a company entering into a transaction is
poor and the shareholder of such a company benefits from a transaction, it may constitute in fact the
return of capital to the shareholder. A breach of these rules results in the shareholders’ obligation to
return the payments up to the amount of the share capital. Therefore, any guarantee under the
Guarantees by any of the Guarantors incorporated under Polish law in such legal form could be affected,
or could be set aside, to the extent that it would result in a reduction of its assets necessary to fully cover
its share capital in breach of Art. 189 sec. 2 of the Polish Commercial Companies Code, may be
considered a return of capital prohibited by Art. 189 sec.1 of the Polish Commercial Companies Code, or
a payment prohibited by Art. 344 sec. 1 of the Polish Commercial Companies Code.

Under the Guarantees, the obligations of the Guarantors incorporated under Polish law are also subject
to the application of laws on bankruptcy and insolvency, and the laws on rehabilitation proceedings, as
set out in the Polish Bankruptcy Law. Specifically, pursuant to Art. 11 sec. 2 of the Polish Bankruptcy Law,
a corporate entity is deemed to be insolvent if its obligations (zobowi˛azania) exceed the value of its
assets (maj˛atek), even if it discharges those liabilities on a current basis. Given certain legal
controversies regarding the application of this rule (especially to future and contingent liabilities), and in
order to mitigate the possibility that a Polish Guarantor could be declared bankrupt under this rule, the
liability of certain Guarantors incorporated under Polish law on account of payments under the
Guarantees may be limited to the amount equivalent to the Polish Guarantor’s net positive assets.

**United Kingdom**

The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors and providers of Collateral are incorporated in, maintain their
respective registered offices in and conduct their business and the administration of their interests on a
regular basis in and from England and Wales (each a ‘‘U.K. Obligor’’). On the basis of these factors, an
English court may conclude that the U.K. Obligors have their ‘‘center of main interests,’’ within the
meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation, in England and therefore insolvency proceedings in England
constituting ‘‘main insolvency proceedings’’ under article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation may be
commenced in respect of a U.K. Obligor.

Upon liquidation of any U.K. Obligor, the order of priorities is such that debts due by it to any holders of
fixed charges over U.K. assets are paid first out of the realization proceeds of assets subject to such fixed
charges (subject to the prior payment of the costs of preservation and realization of the fixed charge
assets). Where there are floating charges, liquidation expenses (discussed further below), preferential
creditors, and unsecured creditors to the extent of the ‘‘ring-fenced’’ fund (discussed further below) may
be paid out of the proceeds of realization of assets subject to those floating charges in priority to
payments to creditors secured by virtue of those floating charges. Thereafter, any debts owing to holders
of the floating charges would be paid to the extent they are secured by that charge. The categories of
preferential debts include certain amounts payable in respect of occupational pension schemes relating
to contributions due but unpaid and employee remuneration up to a specified amount. A certain part of
the net proceeds of the realization of the assets covered by a floating charge (up to a maximum of
£600,000) would be ‘‘ring-fenced’’ and made available pro rata to unsecured creditors. Unsecured debts

which are not preferential debts would be paid from the proceeds of realizations of unsecured assets (if
any) and, after the secured liabilities have been met, from the proceeds of realization of relevant secured
assets.

As discussed further below, certain of the security interests over U.K. assets expected to be created in
favor of the security agent will be expressed as fixed charges, but there is no certainty that the security
will take effect as a fixed charge and it may well take effect as a floating charge. Where no security is
provided to secure the obligations of a U.K. Obligor, any principal debt or guarantee obligation of that
U.K. Obligor will be unsecured.

Liquidation Expenses

The Insolvency Act 1986 (the ‘‘U.K. Insolvency Act’’) broadly states that in a liquidation of a company,
where the assets available for payment of its general creditors (excluding any amount ring-fenced for
unsecured debts as described above) are not sufficient to meet the liquidation expenses, certain
specified liquidation expenses can be claimed out of the realization proceeds of assets subject to a
floating charge and, for these purposes, rank ahead of preferential debts and floating chargees’ claims.
In the case of litigation expenses, this is subject to rules restricting the application of this provision to
certain litigation expenses approved by the floating chargee and any preferential creditors or the court.
Consequently, realizations by secured creditors upon the enforcement of floating charges securing any
principal or guarantee obligation to the Noteholders could potentially be reduced by the amount of any
liquidation expenses. If any fixed security is validly created, any claims of creditors holding such fixed
security would rank ahead of any such liquidation expenses. The creditors holding the security would
though, pay the expenses of realizing their security directly to the liquidator or other person (such as a
receiver or security trustee) who disposed of the secured assets on their behalf.

_Administration_

Administration is an insolvency procedure under the U.K. Insolvency Act pursuant to which a company
may be reorganized or its assets realized under the protection of a statutory moratorium. A company
may be put into administration either pursuant to a court order or via an out-of-court process. Broadly
speaking (and subject to specific conditions), a company can be placed into administration at the
application of, among others, the U.K. Obligor itself, its directors or one or more of its creditors (including
contingent and prospective creditors). A holder of a qualifying floating charge over the assets of the U.K.
Obligor also has the right to appoint an administrator. In addition, he has the right to intervene in an
application made for administration proceeding by another person by nominating an alternative
administrator or, in certain very specific circumstances, by blocking the appointment altogether by the
appointment of an administrative receiver.

Broadly speaking, an interim moratorium comes into effect when an application for an administration
order (in the case of court appointment) or a notice of intention to appoint an administrator (in the case of
an out of court appointment) is made. At the commencement of the appointment of an administrator, a
full statutory moratorium applies Pursuant to both an interim and full moratorium of a U.K. Obligor, no
creditor could take any action against that U.K. Obligor, including, among other things, commencing a
legal process against the U.K. Obligor, winding up the U.K. Obligor or enforcing security or repossessing
goods in the U.K. Obligor’s possession under a hire purchase or similar agreement, without the
permission of the court or (in the case of a full moratorium) the consent of the administrator.

However, certain creditors of a company in administration may be able to realize their security over that
company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of
the moratorium in relation to a ‘‘security financial collateral arrangement’’ (generally, cash or financial
instruments such as shares, bonds or tradable capital market debt instruments) under the Financial
Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003.

Subject to the above points, were a U.K. Obligor to enter administration, it is possible that the security
granted by it may not be enforced while it is in administration. Similarly, whilst any principal debt or
guarantee obligation owed by it would be accelerated or demanded, no meaningful enforcement action
could be taken in respect of any failure to pay.

274


-----

Expenses of the administration

Broadly speaking, expenses that qualify as expenses of the administration (and which include, among
others, expenses properly incurred by the administrator in performing his functions in the administration
and necessary disbursements incurred in the course of the administration) enjoy priority status, in a
similar way to liquidation expenses (as described above) although the categories of expenses are
slightly different. In particular, expenses of the administration can be claimed out of the realization
proceeds of assets subject to a floating charge and, for these purposes, rank ahead of preferential debts
and floating chargees’ claims.

Administration can be used as a proceeding in which to make distributions to creditors like a liquidation
in which case claims of creditors may be submitted to the administrator, although court approval
generally will be required before he can make a distribution to unsecured creditors. Time limits may be
set for receipt and processing of claims before interim dividends are paid.

_Small Companies Moratorium_

Certain ‘‘small companies’’ may, for the purposes of putting together proposals for a company voluntary
arrangement, seek court protection from their creditors by way of a ‘‘moratorium’’ for a period of up to
28 days, with the option for creditors to extend this protection for up to a further 2 months (although the
Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform may, by order, extend or reduce the
duration of either period).

A ‘‘small company’’ is defined for these purposes by reference to whether the company meets certain
tests relating to a company’s balance sheet, total turnover and average number of employees in a
particular period (although the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform may,
by order, modify the moratorium eligibility qualifications and the definition of a ‘‘small company’’).

During the period for which a moratorium is in force in relation to a small company, among other things,
no winding up may be commenced (except in very limited circumstances, for example where the U.K.
Secretary of State considers it to be in the public interest to do so) or administrator or administrative
receiver appointed to that company, no security created by that company over its property may be
enforced (except (1) with the leave of the Court or (2) in the case of existence of eligible financial
collateral arrangements under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No 2) Regulations 2003 whereby
the requirement to get a court order before enforcing security over small companies will not apply), no
other proceedings or legal process may be commenced or continued in relation against that company
(except with the leave of the Court) and the company’s ability to make payments in respect of debts and
liabilities existing at the date of the filing for the moratorium is curtailed. Certain small companies may,
however, be excluded from being eligible for a moratorium (although the Secretary of State for Business,
Enterprise and Regulatory Reform may, by regulations, modify such exclusions). As the law currently
stands, companies that on the date of filing are party to an agreement which is or forms part of a capital
market arrangement are excluded from being eligible for this small companies moratorium.

_Disposal of secured assets while subject to insolvency proceedings_

If a company is the subject of (i) a statutory moratorium as a result of either entering administration or
(ii) the small companies moratorium, and either (x) the holder of security created by that company (other
than financial collateral as above described) consents or (y) if the Court gives leave, the relevant
company or its administrator may dispose of the secured property as if it were not subject to the security.
In addition an administrator can dispose of assets subject to a floating charge without seeking the
consent of the chargeholder or the leave of the Court.

Where the property in question is subject to a security which was created as a floating charge, the
chargee will have the same priority in respect of any property of the company directly or indirectly
representing the property disposed of as he would have had in respect of the property subject to the
security. Where the security in question is other than a floating charge, it shall be a condition of the
chargee’s consent or the leave of the Court that the net proceeds of the disposal shall be applied
towards discharging the sums secured by the security.

_Possible challenges to security interests_

Vulnerable transactions

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of a company would have certain powers to
apply to court to challenge transactions entered into by a U.K. Obligor if that U.K. Obligor is unable to
pay its debts (as defined in the U.K. Insolvency Act) at the time of the transaction or becomes unable to
pay its debts as a result of the transaction.

A transaction might be challenged in this way (as a transaction at an undervalue) if it involved the U.K.
Obligor making a gift or otherwise entering into a transaction on terms that it received no consideration,
or the U.K. Obligor received significantly less value than under the transaction it gave in return. Where an
undervalue transaction is proved, the court has powers to make any order it thinks fit in order to restore
the position to what it would have been had the U.K. Obligor not entered into that transaction. A court will
not intervene, however, if it is satisfied that the U.K. Obligor entered into the transaction in good faith and
for the purposes of carrying on its business and if, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for
believing the transaction would benefit the U.K. Obligor. The court can set aside transactions at an
undervalue entered into by the U.K. Obligor within a period of two years ending with the onset of its
insolvency (as this date is more specifically defined in the U.K. Insolvency Act). In principle, both a
Guarantee granted by a U.K. Obligor or any Collateral provided by it could be challenged as a
transaction at an undervalue.

A transaction might also be challenged in this way (as a preference) where a U.K. Obligor has done
something or suffered something to be done which has the effect of putting a creditor, surety or
guarantor in a better position than the one that person would have been in the event of the U.K. Obligor
going into insolvent liquidation. A court will not intervene however when the U.K. Obligor, in deciding to
give the preference, was not, in deciding to give the act that amounted to a preference, influenced by a
desire to put this person in a better position in the event of insolvent liquidation. If the preference is given
to a person connected to the U.K. Obligor (other than an employee), the court can go back two years
from the date of the onset of insolvency. If the person is not connected to the U.K. Obligor, the court can
only look back and set aside those preferences entered into in the period of six months ending on the
onset of the U.K. Obligor’s insolvency.

Further, an administrator or a liquidator can apply to court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction.
The court can review extortionate credit transactions entered into by a U.K. Obligor up to three years
before the day on which the U.K. Obligor entered into administration or went into liquidation. A
transaction is ‘‘extortionate’’ if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, the
terms of it are (or were) such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether
unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit or it otherwise grossly
contravened ordinary principles of fair dealing.

The U.K. Insolvency Act provides that, in certain circumstances, a floating charge granted by a company
during the ‘‘relevant time’’ may be invalid in whole or in part if certain conditions are met. In the case of a
floating charge which is created in favor of a person that is not connected to a U.K. Obligor, the relevant
time is deemed to be the period of 12 months ending with the onset of the U.K. Obligor’s insolvency
provided that at the time the charge was granted the U.K. Obligor was unable to pay its debts or became
unable to pay its debts as a result of the transaction in respect of which the floating charge was granted.
If the floating charge is created in favor of a person connected to the U.K. Obligor, the relevant look back
time is a period of two years ending with the onset of insolvency.

As a result of the rights to challenge described above, in the event that a U.K. Obligor becomes unable to
pay its debts within a period of up to two years of the issuance of the Notes, an administrator or liquidator
is appointed and the conditions contemplated in the relevant legal provisions are met, the provision of
the relevant Guarantees and Collateral may be challenged by a liquidator or administrator or a court may
set aside the granting of the Guarantees and Collateral as invalid.

_Recharacterization of fixed security interests_

There is a possibility that a court could find that the fixed security interests expressed to be created by
the security documents governed by English law properly take effect as floating charges as the
description given to them as fixed charges is not determinative. Whether the purported fixed security
interests will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating security interests will depend,
among other things, on whether the secured party has the requisite degree of control over the U.K.

276


-----

Obligor’s ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is
exercised by the holder of the security, in practice. Where a U.K. Obligor is free to deal with the assets
that are the subject of a purported fixed charge in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee,
the court would be likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge,
notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge.

While recharacterization is a risk for all attempts to create fixed security, it is a particular risk in relation to
attempts to create fixed security over receivables. This is because even if a company purports to grant
fixed security over its receivables, it will likely retain, in practice, the ability to deal with its receivables in
its discretion and without the consent of the chargee.

If any fixed security interests are recharacterized as floating security interests, the claims of (i) any
unsecured creditors of the relevant U.K. Obligor in respect of that part of the U.K. Obligor’s net property
which is ring fenced (see explanation about ring fencing above); and (ii) certain statutorily defined
preferential creditors of the U.K. Obligor may have priority over the rights of the security agent to the
proceeds of enforcement of such security. In addition, as mentioned above, the expenses of a liquidation
or administration would also rank ahead of the claims of the security agent as floating charge holder.

_Limitation on enforcement_

The grant of a Guarantee or Collateral by any of the U.K. Obligors in respect of the obligations of another
group company must satisfy certain legal requirements. More specifically, such a transaction must be
allowed by the respective company’s memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that the
above do not allow such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee and the subsequent
security can be found to be void and the respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may
be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with a U.K. Obligor in good faith, however the relevant
legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be established for
each U.K. Obligor in question by virtue of entering into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the
Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in the way that he considers, in good faith, would
be most likely to promote the success of the U.K. Obligor for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the
directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found
as abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a
court.

_Equitable share charge_

The fixed charges over shares granted by certain U.K. Obligors are equitable charges, not legal charges.
An equitable charge arises where a chargor transfers the beneficial interest in the shares to the chargee
but retains legal title to the shares. Remedies in relation to equitable charges may be subject to equitable
considerations or are otherwise at the discretion of the court.

_Account banks’ right to set-off_

With respect to the charges over cash deposits (each an ‘‘Account Charge’’) granted by a U.K. Obligor
over any of its bank accounts, the banks with which some of those accounts are held (each an ‘‘Account
Bank’’) may have reserved their right at any time (whether prior to or upon a crystallization event under
the Account Charge) to exercise the rights of netting or set-off to which they are entitled under their cash
pooling or other arrangements with that U.K. Obligor. As a result, and if the security granted over those
accounts is merely a floating (rather than fixed) charge, the collateral constituted by those bank
accounts will be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s netting and set-off rights with respect to the bank
accounts charged under the relevant Account Charge. Once the floating charge has crystallized and
converted into a fixed charge (as it would on enforcement or the occurrence of certain insolvency events
with respect to the relevant U.K. Guarantor) the collateral will no longer be subject to the relevant
Account Bank’s netting and set-off rights, since the Account Bank will only be entitled to exercise its
netting and set-off rights whilst the bank accounts are subject only to floating security, except where
account banks have expressly reserved set-off rights.

_Transaction defrauding creditors_

Under English insolvency law, where it can be shown that a transaction was at an undervalue and was
made for the purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may make, a
claim against a company, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of a person in relation to the claim

277


-----

which that person is making or may make, the transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction
defrauding creditors. An application to the court for an order to set aside the transaction may be made by
an administrator, a liquidator and, subject to certain conditions, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority and
the U.K. Pensions Regulator. In addition, any person who is, or who is capable of being, prejudiced by
the transaction may (with the leave of the court in the case of a company in administration or liquidation)
also bring an application to set aside such transaction. The challenge must be made within 12 years (or
in the case of claims for a sum of money, 6 years) from the date that the cause of action arose. The
relevant company does not need to be insolvent at the time of the transaction. If the court determines
that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make such orders as it thinks fit
to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to
protect the interests of the victims of the transaction. The relevant court order may affect the property of,
or impose any obligation on, any person, whether or not he is the person with whom the transaction was
entered into. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from
a person other than the debtor in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances
and will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good faith, for value and
without notice of the relevant circumstances, to pay any sum unless such person was a party to the
transaction.

**2** **Basis of preparation**

The interim condensed consolidated financial information for the 18 week period ended 4 April 2013 has
been prepared in accordance with best practice as derived from IAS 34, ‘Interim financial reporting’, as
adopted by the European Union.

The interim condensed consolidated financial information does not constitute statutory financial
statements. Statutory financial statements for the 53 week period ended 29 November 2012 were
approved by the board of directors on 10 May 2013 and delivered to the Jersey Registrar of Companies.
The report of the auditors on those accounts was unqualified, did not contain an emphasis of matter
paragraph and did not contain any statement under Article 113B (3) or Article 133B (6) of the Company’s
(Jersey) law.

The interim condensed consolidated financial information should be read in conjunction with the annual
financial statements for the 53 week period ended 29 November 2012, which have been prepared in
accordance with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom and applicable law.

**Going-concern basis**

The Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through operating cash flow and when
required has sufficient bank facilities that can be drawn down. The Group’s forecasts and projections,
taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group should be
able to operate within the level of its current facilities. After making enquiries, the directors have a
reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for
the foreseeable future. The Group therefore continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its
interim condensed consolidated financial statements.

**3** **Accounting Policies**

The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the interim condensed consolidated financial
statements are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the Group’s statutory financial
statements for the 53 week period ended 29 November 2012.

These accounting policies and interpretations are expected to be applicable to the Group for its 2013
financial statements. It is possible that there will be changes to these standards and interpretations
before the end of the Group’s 2013 financial year, which might require adjustments to this information
before it is included in the financial statements for the 52 week period ended 28 November 2013.

Taxes on income in the interim periods are accrued using the tax rates that would be applicable to the
expected total annual profit or loss.

There are no standards that are effective for the first time for this interim period that would be expected to
have a material impact on the Group.

The Company has taken advantage of the exemption contained within FRS 8—’’Related party
Transactions’’ not to disclose related party transactions with other members of its group of companies,
which are wholly owned subsidiaries. No transactions have taken place with other members of its group
of companies, which are not wholly owned subsidiaries.

**4** **Estimates**

This is the first time the Group has prepared interim condensed consolidated financial statements under
IAS34. This requires management to make and disclose significant judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, income and expense. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

In preparing these interim condensed consolidated financial statements, the significant judgements
made by management in applying the Group’s accounting policies and the key sources of estimating
uncertainty were the same as those that were applied to the Group annual financial statements for the
53 week period ended 29 November 2012. Management have determined that the key areas of
judgement to disclose include the nature and obligation of onerous lease provisions, the assessment of
the Group’s digital investment as operating lease commitments and the carrying value of tangible fixed
assets.

**5** **Financial Risk Management**

The interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all financial risk management
information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements, and should be read in
conjunction with the Group’s annual financial statements for the 53 week period ended 29 November
2012 and the director’s report on pages 6, 7 and 11.

There have been no significant changes in the risk management policies since year end.

**Deferred Taxation**

Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates which are expected to apply in the
periods in which such timing differences reverse based on tax rates and laws substantively enacted at
the balance sheet date. No provision has been made for deferred tax on gains recognised on the sale of
property where potentially taxable gains are rolled over into replacement assets. The total amount
unprovided at 4 April 2013 is £1.0m (29 March 2012: £1.0m). At present it is not envisaged that any such
tax will become payable in the foreseeable future. Unrecognised deferred taxation in the current period
is £nil.

**8** **Dividends**

The directors do not recommend an interim dividend be paid for the 18 week period ended 4 April 2013.

In addition, no dividend was paid for the 18 week period ended 29 March 2012.

**Notes to the Financial Statements — (continued)**

**for the 18 week period ended 4 April 2013**

**11** **Loans (senior debt net of bank fees) (continued)**

On 14 December 2012 the Company signed an amendment to the Senior Facilities Agreement dated
7 November 2010 in order to repay shareholder bridging loans and the standalone term facility loan that
had been put in place to fund acquisitions. This amended the Company’s existing borrowing facilities via
an additional Facility B Loan (Tranche III) of e105m and additional Facility C Loan of £53m.

In addition, the Revolver Facility was increased by £10m from £15m to £25m and the Capex Facility was
reduced by £10m from £30m to £20m with an extension of the period to which the Capex Facility can be
drawn upon to 20 December 2016. The original facilities being Facility A, BI and BII were not altered by
the amendment and are still in existence.

The interest and terms of Facilities A, BI, BII, Revolver and Capex have not changed from the disclosure
in the annual financial statements to 29 November 2012. Facility BIII bears interest at EURIBOR plus a
maximum margin of 5.0% (dependent on leverage ratio) and is repayable by one instalment in
December 2017. Facility C bears interest at LIBOR plus a maximum margin of 5.5% (dependent on
leverage ratio) and is repayable by one instalment in December 2018.

On 13 March 2013 the Group entered into two swaps with a notional value of £35m and e70m. Under
these swaps, the Group receives or pays interest depending on whether the variable rate (based in
LIBOR and EURIBOR respectively) is greater or less than the fixed rate of 0.535% and 0.385%
respectively. Both the swaps have a termination date of 28 February 2015. There has been no change in
the terms or interest on the swaps previously in place and disclosure can be found in the annual financial
statements for the 53 week period to 29 November 2012.

**Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of**
**Vue Entertainment Investment Limited**

We have audited the Group and Parent Company financial statements of Vue Entertainment International
Limited for the 53 weeks ended 29 November 2012 which comprise the Consolidated Profit and Loss
Account, the Consolidated and Company Balance Sheets, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the
Consolidated Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses, the Consolidated Statement of Group
Shareholders’ Deficit and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in
their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards.

**Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors**

As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on pages 11 and 12 the
directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they
give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements
in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.

This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a
body in accordance with Article 113A of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and for no other purpose. We
do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other
person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by
our prior consent in writing.

**Scope of the audit of the financial statements**

An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements
sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement,
whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the Group’s and Parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the
directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial
and non-financial information in the Directors’ Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited
financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we
consider the implications for our report.

**Opinion on financial statements**

In our opinion the financial statements:

- give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and Parent Company’s affairs as at 29 November
2012 and of the Group’s loss and cash flows for the period then ended;

- have been properly prepared in accordance United Kingdom Accounting Standards; and

- have been properly prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies (Jersey) Law
1991.

**Opinion on other matter**

In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial period for which financial
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.

**Matters on which we are required to report by exception**

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991
requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:

- proper accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company; or

**Vue Entertainment International Limited**

**Notes to the Financial Statements**

**for the period ended 29 November 2012**

**1** **Accounting Policies**

**a)** **Basis of preparation**

These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention in accordance with
the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom. A
summary of the more important Group accounting policies is set out below, together with an explanation
of where changes have been made to previous policies on the adoption of new accounting standards in
the period.

The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The directors deemed it
appropriate to prepare the accounts on a going concern basis having given due regard to the trading
results and capital structure of the Group. In particular the working capital requirements of the Group are
met by the Group’s available cash balance combined with the revolving credit facility provided under the
Senior Debt Agreements with Vue Holdings (UK) Limited, a subsidiary undertaking of the Company,
signed on 7 November 2010. The Group has also provided that funds are available for planned capital
expenditures by way of a facility with a final draw down date of 21 December 2013 (extended to
December 2016 under the refinancing—see note 35). The longer term finance of the Group is provided
under an A and B loan structure with maturities of 6 and 7 years respectively. Further finance is provided
by subordinated shareholder funding with maturity dates on the earlier of 31 December 2020 or an ‘exit
event’. As a result Vue Entertainment International Limited directors believe that the Company and all its
current subsidiaries will, for the foreseeable future, be able to continue trading and meet all their liabilities
as they fall due. In December 2012 the Company entered into new senior debt arrangements (see
note 35).

There is no material difference between the fair value of financial assets and liabilities and their carrying
amount.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the amount, event or
actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. Further details regarding areas
requiring significant assumptions and estimates are provided in the accounting policies below and in the
relevant note to the financial statements where applicable.

**b)** **Accounting reference date**

The Company prepares financial statements for either 52 or 53 week periods ending on a Thursday
within one week of 30 November. The results of the current period refer to the 53 weeks ended
29 November 2012. The comparative results refer to the 56 week period from 26 October 2010 (date of
incorporation) to 24 November 2011.

**c)** **Basis of consolidation**

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and all of its
subsidiary undertakings as listed in note 13. The elimination of group transactions occurs on
consolidation.

**d)** **Acquisitions**

Treganna Bidco Limited was incorporated on 1 May 2012 as a holding company to acquire Apollo
Cinemas Limited. On 10 May 2012 Treganna Bidco Limited acquired 100% of the share capital in Apollo
Cinemas Limited.

From 30 March 2012, the first day of Apollo Cinemas Limited’s latest financial year, to 10 May 2012
Apollo Cinemas Limited had turnover of £2,784k and an operating loss of £346k; loss before taxation
was £389k and taxation credit £713k. The loss after tax for Apollo Cinemas Limited for the year ended

**Vue Entertainment International Limited**

**Notes to the Financial Statements — (continued)**

**for the period ended 29 November 2012**

**1** **Accounting Policies (continued)**

29 March 2012 was £5,372k. There is no difference between the profit after tax and the recognised gains
and losses for the period.

Vue Beteiligungs AG was incorporated on 23 March 2012 as a holding company to acquire CinemaxX
AG. On 10 July 2012 Vue Beteiligungs AG announced its intention to launch a voluntary public takeover
offer for all outstanding shares of CinemaxX AG, a group listed on the Frankfurt and Hamburg Stock
Exchanges. On 7 August 2012, Vue Beteiligungs AG acquired 91.34% of the share capital of CinemaxX
AG as a result of this public offer. As at the Company’s financial period end, 95.15% of all shares in
CinemaxX AG had been acquired.

From 1 January 2012, the first day of CinemaxX AG’s latest financial year, to 7 August 2012, the effective
date of acquisition, CinemaxX AG had turnover of e117,416k and an operating profit of e10,788k, profit
before taxation was e6,331k and taxation e4,949k. The profit after tax for CinemaxX AG for the year
ended 31 December 2011 was e18,778k. There is no difference between the profit after tax and the
recognised gains and losses for the period.

The identifiable assets and liabilities of the company acquired are included in the consolidated balance
sheet at their fair value at the date of acquisition, and its results included in the profit and loss account
from the date of the acquisition. The difference between the fair value of the consideration given and the
fair values of the net assets of the entity acquired is accounted for as goodwill.

**e)** **Company profit and loss**

The profit and loss account of the Company is not presented as a part of these financial statements.

**f)** **Revenue recognition**

Revenue is reported net of value added tax and comprises primarily ticket and concession sales and
screen advertising income. Revenue from ticket sales is reported in the period in which the film is shown.
Income from screen advertising guaranteed income is recognised evenly over the period to which they
relate. Other screen advertising income is recognised as generated. Concession revenue is recognised
at the time of sale.

**g)** **Depreciation**

Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets in use during the period. The rates used are
calculated to write off the cost or valuation, less estimated residual value, of each asset evenly over its
expected useful life at the following annual rates:

Short leasehold land and buildings — 25 years (or length of the lease, if shorter)
Other cinema site assets — 15 years (or length of the lease, if shorter)
Equipment — 3–20 years

The annual rate of depreciation on equipment now reflects rates used in CinemaxX AG. The rate within
the existing business is 3–10 years in line with the prior year.

Where fixed assets have been revalued these amounts are being depreciated over the shorter of the
lease term or 20 years.

**h)** **Impairment of fixed assets**

The need for any fixed asset impairment provision is assessed by comparison of the carrying value of an
income generating unit, which normally comprises the portfolio of sites that operate within a market
place, against a value in use or net realisable value that is lower than the net book value. The value in use
has been calculated using a discounted cash flow methodology in accordance with applicable Financial
Reporting Standards.

**Vue Entertainment International Limited**

**Notes to the Financial Statements — (continued)**

**for the period ended 29 November 2012**

**1** **Accounting Policies (continued)**

The discounting rate used in assessing the value in use of the assets is the estimated weighted average
cost of capital employed by the Group, adjusted as necessary for any particular risks of the subsidiary
being reviewed. The weighted average cost of capital employed by the Group has been calculated as
the weighted average of the internal rate of return applied in the equity funding and the Group’s bank
debt interest rate.

**i)** **Intangible assets**

Goodwill is the difference between the aggregate of the fair value of those separately identifiable assets
and liabilities acquired and the fair value of the purchase consideration.

Goodwill is capitalised and amortised over its useful life, which in the opinion of the directors is 20 years.
It is reviewed for impairment at the end of the first full financial year following acquisition and in other
periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

**j)** **Fixed asset investments**

Investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment. Investments in subsidiaries are reviewed
annually for possible impairment.

**k)** **Stock**

Stock is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value after making due allowance for any obsolete
items.

**l)** **Pensions**

Pension contributions (which are made to a defined contribution Group Personal Pension Plan) are
charged to the profit and loss account as incurred. These contributions are invested separately from the
Group’s assets.

**m) Operating lease arrangements**

Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account in equal amounts over the lease term.
Lease incentives are amortised over the shorter of the period to the next rent review date or over the
remaining term of the lease.

**n)** **Finance lease arrangements**

Where the Company enters into a lease which entails taking substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership of an asset, the lease is treated as a ‘‘finance lease’’. The asset is recorded in the balance
sheet as a tangible fixed asset and is depreciated over its estimated useful life or the term of the lease,
whichever is shorter. Future installments under such leases, net of finance charges, are included within
creditors. Rentals payable are apportioned between the finance element, which is charged to the profit
and loss account, and the capital element which reduces the outstanding obligation for future
installments.

**o)** **Current and deferred taxation**

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period using tax rates enacted or
substantially enacted at the balance sheet date, together with any adjustment in respect of tax payable
for previous periods.

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the
balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future
or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.

**Vue Entertainment International Limited**

**Notes to the Financial Statements — (continued)**

**for the period ended 29 November 2012**

**1** **Accounting Policies (continued)**

A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of
all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits
against which to recover carried forward tax losses and from which the future reversal of underlying
timing differences can be deducted.

Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the
timing differences are expected to reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.

**p)** **Translation of foreign currencies**

Assets, liabilities, revenues and costs denominated in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of
exchange ruling at the dates of the transactions; monetary assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date
are translated at the period end rate of exchange. All exchange differences arising are reported as part of
the profit or loss for the period.

In respect of the Company’s subsidiaries, profit and loss accounts in currencies other than sterling are
translated into sterling at average exchange rates. Balance sheets are translated into sterling at the rates
ruling at the period end. Exchange differences arising on consolidation are taken directly to reserves.

**q)** **Pre-opening and initial site development expenses**

In accordance with accounting pronouncement Urgent Issues Task Force (‘‘UITF’’) Abstract 24—
‘‘Accounting for Start up Costs’’, pre-opening costs are written off in the period in which they are
incurred.

Expenditure of a capital nature, as set out in Financial Reporting Standard (‘‘FRS’’) 15—‘‘Tangible Fixed
Assets’’, is capitalised from the date at which the Board approves the development of the cinema site.

**r)** **Financial instruments**

As part of its interest rate management strategy the Group has entered into interest rate swap contracts.
The interest received/paid on these contracts is netted against the interest paid on the loans.

**s)** **Onerous lease**

Provision is made for onerous leases where it is considered that the unavoidable costs of the lease
obligations are in excess of the economic benefits expected to be received by it. The unavoidable costs
of the lease reflect the net cost of exiting from the contract and are measured as the lower of the net
present value of the cost of continuing to operate the lease and any penalties or other costs of exiting
from it.

**t)** **Related party transactions**

The Company has taken advantage of the exemption contained within FRS 8—‘‘Related Party
Transactions’’ not to disclose related party transactions with other members of its group of companies,
which are wholly owned subsidiaries.

**u)** **Minority interests**

Equity minority interests represent the share of the profits less losses on ordinary activities attributable to
the interests of equity shareholders in subsidiaries which are not wholly owned by the Group.

Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates which are expected to apply in the
periods in which such timing differences reverse based on tax rates and laws substantively enacted at
the balance sheet date. No provision has been made for deferred tax on gains recognised on the sale of
property where potentially taxable gains are rolled over into replacement assets. The total amount
unprovided is £1.0m (2011 £1.2m). At present it is not envisaged that any such tax will become payable
in the foreseeable future. Unrecognised deferred taxation in the current period is £nil.

Deferred tax acquired as at 29 November 2012 relates to taxable losses carried forward within the
CinemaxX AG group in accordance with FRS19 (see note 34).

**33** **Acquisition of Apollo Cinemas Limited**

On 10 May 2012 the Company’s subsidiary, Treganna Bidco Limited acquired 100% of the share capital
in Apollo Cinemas Limited.

The Company believes that the carrying value of the underlying assets and liabilities on acquisition are
the current fair value and these are reflected below.

**Goodwill . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** 8,322

Deferred taxation has been calculated in respect of various fair value adjustments arising on the
acquisition in accordance with FRS 19. Timing differences relate to fixed assets and have been
determined based on the difference between the pre-existing tax written down value and/or the agreed
purchase price and their fair value in respect of qualifying expenditure. A significant proportion of sites
assets and their associated fair value do not qualify for capital allowances. These items give rise to a
permanent timing difference.

The assets held for sale relate to five sites within the acquired Apollo Cinemas Limited circuit that were
identified for disposal.

In its last financial year to 29 March 2012, Apollo Cinemas Limited made a loss after tax of £5,372k.

The table below shows the results of the acquired business from 30 March 2012 to 10 May 2012.

Deferred taxation has been calculated in respect of taxable losses carried forward within the CinemaxX
AG Group in accordance with FRS 19. These taxable losses are available to be offset against future
taxable profits.

Revaluation adjustments reflect the write-down of goodwill.

Fair value adjustments have been made for the alignment of accounting policies to be in line with Group
policy.

The intangible fixed asset adjustment reflects IT software licenses being included as tangible fixed
assets and the reversal of goodwill relating to the purchase of a new site which under Group policy will
not be recognised as no formal contract has been signed.

The tangible fixed asset adjustment reflects IT software licenses reclassified from intangible fixed assets.
Additionally the leasing of buildings and other cinema assets are to be treated as operating leases rather
than finance leases, in line with UK GAAP.

The provisions adjustment relates to the reversal of provisions for the purchase of a new site which under
Group policy will not be recognised as no formal contract had been signed.

The deferred tax adjustment reflects the carried forward losses available to be utilised by the Group.

In its last financial year to 31 December 2011, CinemaxX AG made a profit after tax of e18,778k under
IFRS reporting.

**Vue Entertainment International Limited**

**Notes to the Financial Statements**

**for the period ended to 24 November 2011**

**1** **Accounting Policies**

**a)** **Basis of preparation**

These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention in accordance with
the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom. A
summary of the more important Group accounting policies is set out below, together with an explanation
of where changes have been made to previous policies on the adoption of new accounting standards in
the period.

The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The directors deemed it
appropriate to prepare the accounts on a going concern basis having given due regard to the trading
results and capital structure of the Group. In particular the working capital requirements of the Group are
met by the Group’s available cash balance combined with the revolving credit facility provided under the
Senior Debt Agreements with Vue Holdings (UK) Limited, a subsidiary undertaking of the Company,
signed on 7 November 2010. The Group has also provided that funds are available for planned capital
expenditures by way of a facility with a final draw down date of 21 December 2013. The longer term
finance of the Group is provided under an A and B loan structure with maturities of 6 and 7 years
respectively. Further finance is provided by subordinated shareholder funding with maturity dates on the
earlier of 31 December 2020 or an ‘exit event’. As a result Vue Entertainment International Limited
directors believe that the Company and all its current subsidiaries will, for the foreseeable future, be able
to continue trading and meet all their liabilities as they fall due.

There is no material difference between the fair value of financial assets and liabilities and their carrying
amount.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the amount, event or
actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. Further details regarding areas
requiring significant assumptions and estimates are provided in the accounting policies below and in the
relevant note to the financial statements where applicable.

**b)** **Accounting reference date**

The Company prepares financial statements for either 52 or 53 week periods ending on a Thursday
within one week of 30 November. As this is the first reporting period of the Company, the results for the
current period refer to the 56 week period ended 24 November 2011.

**c)** **Basis of consolidation**

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and all of its
subsidiary undertakings as listed in note 13. The elimination of group transactions occurs on
consolidation.

**d)** **Acquisitions**

On 21 December 2010 the Company acquired 100% of the share holding of Vue Entertainment
Investment Limited for a total consideration of £459.5m (see note 31) Vue Entertainment Investment
Limited and its related subsidiaries operate various multiplexes in the United Kingdom, Eire, Portugal
and Taiwan.

The identifiable assets and liabilities of the company acquired are included in the consolidated balance
sheet at their fair value at the date of acquisition, and its results included in the profit and loss account
from the date of the acquisition. The difference between the fair value of the consideration given and the
fair values of the net assets of the entity acquired is accounted for as goodwill.

**Vue Entertainment International Limited**

**Notes to the Financial Statements — (continued)**

**for the period ended to 24 November 2011**

**1** **Accounting Policies (continued)**

**e)** **Company profit and loss**

The profit and loss account of the Company is not presented as a part of these financial statements.

**f)** **Revenue recognition**

Revenue is reported net of value added tax and comprises primarily ticket and concession sales and
screen advertising income. Revenue from ticket sales is reported in the period in which the film is shown.
Income from screen advertising guaranteed income is recognised evenly over the period to which they
relate. Other screen advertising income is recognised as generated. Concession revenue is recognised
at the time of sale.

**g)** **Depreciation**

Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets in use during the period. The rates used are
calculated to write off the cost or valuation, less estimated residual value, of each asset evenly over its
expected useful life at the following annual rates:

Short leasehold land and buildings — 25 years (or length of the lease, if shorter)
Other cinema site assets — 15 years (or length of the lease, if shorter)
Equipment — 3–10 years

Where fixed assets have been revalued these amounts are being depreciated over the shorter of the
lease term or 20 years.

**h)** **Impairment of fixed assets**

The need for any fixed asset impairment provision is assessed by comparison of the carrying value of an
income generating unit, which normally comprises the portfolio of sites that operate within a market
place, against a value in use or net realisable value that is lower than the net book value. The value in use
has been calculated using a discounted cash flow methodology in accordance with applicable Financial
Reporting Standards. The discounting rate used in assessing the value in use of the assets is the
estimated weighted average cost of capital employed by the Group, adjusted as necessary for any
particular risks of the subsidiary being reviewed. The weighted average cost of capital employed by the
Group has been calculated as the weighted average of the internal rate of return applied in the equity
funding and the Group’s bank debt interest rate.

**i)** **Intangible assets**

Goodwill is the difference between the aggregate of the fair value of those separately identifiable assets
and liabilities acquired and the fair value of the purchase consideration.

Goodwill is capitalised and amortised over its useful life, which in the opinion of the directors is 20 years.
It is reviewed for impairment at the end of the first full financial year following acquisition and in other
periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

**j)** **Fixed asset investments**

Investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment. Investments in subsidiaries are reviewed
annually for possible impairment.

**k)** **Stock**

Stock is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value after making due allowance for any obsolete
items.

**Vue Entertainment International Limited**

**Notes to the Financial Statements — (continued)**

**for the period ended to 24 November 2011**

**1** **Accounting Policies (continued)**

**l)** **Pensions**

Pension contributions (which are made to a defined contribution Group Personal Pension Plan) are
charged to the profit and loss account as incurred. These contributions are invested separately from the
Group’s assets.

**m) Leases**

Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account in equal amounts over the lease term.
Lease incentives are amortised over the shorter of the period to the next rent review date or over the
remaining term of the lease.

**n)** **Current and deferred taxation**

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period using tax rates enacted or
substantially enacted at the balance sheet date, together with any adjustment in respect of tax payable
for previous periods.

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the
balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future
or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.

A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of
all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits
against which to recover carried forward tax losses and from which the future reversal of underlying
timing differences can be deducted.

Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the
timing differences are expected to reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.

**o)** **Translation of foreign currencies**

Assets, liabilities, revenues and costs denominated in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of
exchange ruling at the dates of the transactions; monetary assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date
are translated at the period end rate of exchange. All exchange differences arising are reported as part of
the profit or loss for the period.

In respect of the Company’s subsidiaries, profit and loss accounts in currencies other than sterling are
translated into sterling at closing exchange rates. Balance sheets are translated into sterling at the rates
ruling at the period end. Exchange differences arising on consolidation are taken directly to reserves.

**p)** **Pre-opening and initial site development expenses**

In accordance with accounting pronouncement Urgent Issues Task Force (‘‘UITF’’) Abstract 24—
‘‘Accounting for Start up Costs’’, pre-opening costs are written off in the period in which they are
incurred.

Expenditure of a capital nature, as set out in Financial Reporting Standard (‘‘FRS’’) 15—‘‘Tangible Fixed
Assets’’, is capitalised from the date at which the Board approves the development of the cinema site.

**q)** **Financial instruments**

As part of its interest rate management strategy the Group has entered into interest rate swap contracts.
The interest received/paid on these contracts is netted against the interest paid on the loans.

**r)** **Onerous lease**

Provision is made for onerous leases where it is considered that the unavoidable costs of the lease
obligations are in excess of the economic benefits expected to be received by it. The unavoidable costs
of the lease reflect the net cost of exiting from the contract and are measured as the lower of the net
present value of the cost of continuing to operate the lease and any penalties or other costs of exiting
from it.

**s)** **Related party transactions**

The Company has taken advantage of the exemption contained within FRS 8—‘‘Related Party
Transactions’’ not to disclose related party transactions with other members of its group of companies,
which are wholly owned subsidiaries.

A number of changes to the UK Corporation tax system were announced in the June 2010 Budget
Statement. The Finance (No 2) Act 2010 included legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax
from 28% to 27% from 1 April 2011. Further reductions to the main rate are proposed to reduce the rate
by 1% per annum to 24% by 1 April 2014. The changes had not been substantively enacted at the
balance sheet date and, therefore, are not included in these financial statements.

Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates which are expected to apply in the
periods in which such timing differences reverse based on tax rates and laws substantively enacted at
the balance sheet date. No provision has been made for deferred tax on gains recognised on the sale of
property where potentially taxable gains are rolled over into replacement assets. The total amount
unprovided is £1.2m. At present it is not envisaged that any such tax will become payable in the
foreseeable future.

Unrecognised deferred taxation in the current period is £nil.

**Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of**
**Vue Entertainment Investment Limited**

We have audited the Group and Parent Company financial statements of Vue Entertainment Investment
Limited for the 52 weeks ended 25 November 2010, which comprise; the Consolidated Profit and Loss
Account, the Consolidated and Parent Company Balance Sheets, the Consolidated Cash Flow
Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses, the Consolidated
Statement of Group Shareholders’ Deficit and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that
has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

**Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors**

As explained more fully in the Statement of directors’ responsibilities set out on pages 11 and 12, the
directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they
give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.

This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a
body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We
do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other
person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by
our prior consent in writing.

**Scope of the audit of the financial statements**

An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements
sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement,
whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the Group’s and Parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the
directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements.

**Opinion on financial statements**

In our opinion the financial statements:

- give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and the Parent Company’s affairs as at
25 November 2010 and of the Group’s loss and cash flows for the 52 weeks then ended;

- have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice; and

- have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

**Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006**

In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial period for which the financial
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.

**Matters on which we are required to report by exception**

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us
to report to you if, in our opinion:

- adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for
our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or

- the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or

**Vue Entertainment Investment Limited**

**Notes to the Financial Statements**

**for the period ended 25 November 2010**

**1** **Accounting Policies**

**a)** **Basis of preparation**

These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention in accordance with
the Companies Act 2006 and applicable accounting standards. A summary of the more important Group
accounting policies is set out below, together with an explanation of where changes have been made to
previous policies on the adoption of new accounting standards in the period.

The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. Vue Entertainment Investment
Limited directors believe that the Company and all its current subsidiaries will, for the foreseeable future,
be able to continue trading and meet all their liabilities as they fall due. As a result, the directors have
deemed it appropriate to prepare the accounts on a going concern basis.

There is no material difference between the fair value of financial assets and liabilities and their carrying
amount.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the amount, event or
actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. Further details regarding areas
requiring significant assumptions and estimates are provided in the accounting policies below and in the
relevant note to the financial statements where applicable.

**b)** **Accounting reference date**

The Company prepares financial statements for either 52 or 53 week periods ending on a Thursday
within one week of 30 November. The results for the current period refer to the 52 week period ended
25 November 2010. The comparative results for the prior period refer to the 52 week period ended
26 November 2009.

**c)** **Basis of consolidation**

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and all of its
subsidiary undertakings as listed in note 12. The principal accounting policies have been consistently
applied throughout the group. The elimination of group transactions occurs on consolidation.

**d)** **Acquisitions**

The identifiable assets and liabilities of the company acquired are included in the consolidated balance
sheet at their fair value at the date of acquisition as adjusted during the hindsight period, and its results
included in the profit and loss account from the date of the acquisition. The difference between the fair
value of the consideration given and the fair values of the net assets of the entity acquired is accounted
for as goodwill.

**e)** **Company profit and loss**

As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act, the profit and loss account of the Company is not
presented as a part of these financial statements.

**f)** **Revenue recognition**

Revenue is reported net of value added tax and comprises primarily ticket and concession sales and
screen advertising income. Revenue from ticket sales is reported in the period in which the film is shown.
Income from screen advertising guaranteed income is recognised evenly over the period to which they
relate. Other screen advertising income is recognised as generated. Concession revenue is recognised
at the time of sale.

**Vue Entertainment Investment Limited**

**Notes to the Financial Statements — (continued)**

**for the period ended 25 November 2010**

**1** **Accounting Policies (continued)**

**g)** **Depreciation**

Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets in use during the period. The rates used are
calculated to write off the cost or valuation, less estimated residual value, of each asset evenly over its
expected useful life at the following annual rates:

Short leasehold land and buildings . . . . . . . . . . 25 years (or length of the lease, if shorter)
Other cinema site assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15 years (or length of the lease, if shorter)
Equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3–10 years

Where fixed assets have been revalued these amounts are being depreciated over the shorter of the
lease term or 20 years.

**h)** **Impairment of fixed assets**

The need for any fixed asset impairment provision is assessed by comparison of the carrying value of an
income generating unit, which normally comprises the portfolio of sites that operate within a market
place, against a value in use or net realisable value that is lower than the net book value. The value in use
has been calculated using a discounted cash flow methodology in accordance with applicable Financial
Reporting Standards.

The discounting rate used in assessing the value in use of the assets is the estimated weighted average
cost of capital employed by the Group, adjusted as necessary for any particular risks of the subsidiary
being reviewed. The weighted average cost of capital employed by the Group has been calculated as
the weighted average of the internal rate of return applied in the equity funding and the Group’s bank
debt interest rate.

**i)** **Intangible assets**

Goodwill is the difference between the aggregate of the fair value of those separately identifiable assets
and liabilities acquired and the fair value of the purchase consideration.

Goodwill is capitalised and amortised over its useful life, which in the opinion of the directors is 20 years.
It is reviewed for impairment at the end of the first full financial year following acquisition and in other
periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

**j)** **Fixed asset investments**

Investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment. Investments in subsidiaries are reviewed
annually for possible impairment.

**k)** **Stock**

Stock is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value after making due allowance for any obsolete
items.

**l)** **Pensions**

Pension contributions (which are made to a defined contribution Group Personal Pension Plan) are
charged to the profit and loss account as incurred. These contributions are invested separately from the
Group’s assets.

**m) Leases**

Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account in equal amounts over the lease term.
Lease incentives are amortised over the shorter of the period to the next rent review date or over the
remaining term of the lease.

**Vue Entertainment Investment Limited**

**Notes to the Financial Statements — (continued)**

**for the period ended 25 November 2010**

**1** **Accounting Policies (continued)**

**n)** **Current and deferred taxation**

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period using tax rates enacted or
substantially enacted at the balance sheet date, together with any adjustment in respect of tax payable
for previous periods.

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the
balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future
or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.

A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of
all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits
against which to recover carried forward tax losses and from which the future reversal of underlying
timing differences can be deducted.

Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the
timing differences are expected to reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.

**o)** **Translation of foreign currencies**

Assets, liabilities, revenues and costs denominated in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of
exchange ruling at the dates of the transactions; monetary assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date
are translated at the period end rate of exchange. All exchange differences arising are reported as part of
the profit or loss for the period.

In respect of the Company’s subsidiaries, profit and loss accounts in currencies other than sterling are
translated into sterling at closing exchange rates. Balance sheets are translated into sterling at the rates
ruling at the period end. Exchange differences arising on consolidation are taken directly to reserves.

**p)** **Pre-opening and initial site development expenses**

In accordance with accounting pronouncement Urgent Issues Task Force (‘‘UITF’’) Abstract
24—‘‘Accounting for Start up Costs’’, pre-opening costs are written off in the period in which they are
incurred.

Expenditure of a capital nature, as set out in Financial Reporting Standard (‘‘FRS’’) 15—‘‘Tangible Fixed
Assets’’, is capitalised from the date at which the Board approves the development of the cinema site.

**q)** **Financial instruments**

As part of its interest rate management strategy the Group has entered into interest rate swap contracts.
The interest received/paid on these contracts is netted against the interest paid on loans.

**r)** **Onerous lease**

Provision is made for onerous leases where it is considered that the unavoidable costs of the lease
obligations are in excess of the economic benefits expected to be received by it. The unavoidable costs
of the lease reflect the net cost of exiting from the contract and are measured as the lower of the net
present value of the cost of continuing to operate the lease and any penalties or other costs of exiting
from it.

**s)** **Preference shares**

The Group adopts the presentational requirements of FRS 25, ‘Financial instruments: Disclosure and
presentation’ in these financial statements. The effect of this accounting policy is to present the
preference shares of £47.7m (2009: £47.6m) as a liability, rather than as part of equity.

A number of changes to the UK Corporation tax system were announced in the June 2010 Budget
Statement. The Finance (No 2) Act 2010 included legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax
from 28% to 27% from 1 April 2011. Further reductions to the main rate are proposed to reduce the rate
by 1% per annum to 24% by 1 April 2014. The changes had not been substantively enacted at the
balance sheet date and, therefore, are not included in these financial statements.

At 25 November 2010 the Group had drawn bank loans and junior subordinated loans of £249.3m (2009:
£268.3m) net of related unamortised fees. These balances represent fully drawn balances on the
Group’s term credit facilities Senior Facility A, Senior Facility B, Senior Facility C1, Senior Facility C2,
Senior Capex Facility, Mezzanine Loan and Junior Subordinated Loan, with £nil (2009: £nil) drawn on the
Senior Revolving Facility.

**Senior Facility A Loan**

A loan of £39.6m was drawn down on 20 June 2006 and is repayable in bi-annual instalments over a
6 year period commencing 30 November 2006. The loan bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin of
between 1.50% and 2.25%. During the year the Group reduced its borrowings under this facility by
£11.0m (2009: £13.7m). The balance outstanding as at 25 November 2010 was £2.2m (2009: £13.2m).
Following submission of these financial statements to the Company’s banking syndicate, £2.2m is
repayable under the ‘‘excess cash flow’’ covenant requirements. This will result in the full repayment of
the facility.

**Senior Revolving Facility**

The Group is able to draw down on a £15.0m working capital facility, which was undrawn as at
25 November 2010 (2009: £nil). The Group is able to draw on this facility to 20 June 2013. The facility
bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 2.25%.

**Senior Capex Facility**

The Group was able to draw down on this £35.0m facility for Capital Expenditure requirements until the
20 June 2009, at which time the amount drawn was converted into a term loan. This loan was fully drawn
down by 20 June 2009 and is now repayable in bi-annual instalments over a 4 year period ending
20 June 2013. The loan bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin of between 2.00% and 2.75%. £29.2m was
outstanding under this facility at 25 November 2010 (2009: £35.0m). Following submission of these
financial statements to the Company’s banking syndicate, £9.8m is repayable under the ‘‘excess cash
flow’’ covenant requirements. This reduces future scheduled payments.

**Senior Facility B Loan**

This loan of £59.4m was drawn down on 20 June 2006 and is repayable by one instalment that is due on
20 June 2014. The loan bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin of between 2.25% and 2.75%.

**Senior Facility C1 Loan**

This loan of £36.7m was drawn down on 20 June 2006 and is repayable by one instalment that is due on
20 June 2015. The loan bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 3.25%.

3.25%.

**Mezzanine Loan**

This loan of £35.0m was drawn down on 20 June 2006 and is repayable by one installment that is due on

25 November 2010 was £10.5m (2009: £7.9m).

**Junior Subordinated Loan**

This loan of £42.7m was drawn down on 20 June 2006 and is repayable by one installment that is due on
20 June 2017. The loan bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 13%. The full interest cost is rolled up to
increase the loan. The interest accrued, as at 25 November 2010 was £12.0m (2009: £14.8m). £11.1m
(2009: £12.1m) of the accrued interest was paid in the period, relating to the ‘‘excess’’ cash flow sweep.
Following submission of these financial statements to the Company’s banking syndicate, £12.0m is
repayable under the ‘‘excess cash flow’’ covenant requirements.

**Capitalised bank fees**

Group bank loans and junior subordinated loans are stated net of unamortised issue costs at
25 November 2010 of £5.0m (2009: £6.4m). These costs are allocated to the profit and loss account over
the terms of the individual loans.

**Swap Contracts**

During the period the Group had in operation two interest rate swaps as part of the Groups’ interest rate
management strategy with a notional value of £207.0m (2009: £213.2m) comprising a sterling LIBOR
swap of £178.8m (2009: £183.2m) and a Euro EURIBOR swap of e33.2m (£28.2m), (2009: e33.2m,
£30.0m). Under these swaps, the Group receives or pays interest depending on whether the variable
rate (based in LIBOR and EURIBOR) is greater or less than the fixed rates of 5.15% and 3.67%
respectively.

On 25 November these two swap contracts were closed out and settled. The termination of these
arrangements resulted in a cost to the Group of £5.8m for the Sterling LIBOR swap and e0.7m (£0.6m)
for the Euro EURIBOR swap.

**Security**

The bank loans are secured by a fixed and floating charge over certain of the Group’s assets.

**Translation of Auditor’s Report**

We have audited the consolidated financial statements, comprising the consolidated statement of
comprehensive income, the consolidated balance sheet, the consolidated statement of changes in
equity, the consolidated statement of cash flows, the notes to the consolidated financial statements, and
the combined management and group management report (group management report) of CinemaxX
Aktiengesellschaft, Hamburg, for the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2012. The
preparation of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report in accordance
with IFRS, as adopted by the European Union (EU), and the additional provisions of German commercial
law pursuant to § 315a (1) HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch „German Commercial Code‘‘], is the responsibility
of the Parent Company’s management board. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
consolidated financial statements and the group management report based on our audit.

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with § 317 HGB

[Handelsgesetzbuch „German Commercial Code‘‘] and German generally accepted standards for the
audit of financial statements promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr¨ufer [Institute of Public
Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit such that
misstatements materially affecting the presentation of the net assets, financial position and results of
operations in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the applicable financial reporting
framework and in the group management report are detected with reasonable assurance. Knowledge of
the business activities and the economic and legal environment of the Group and expectations as to
possible misstatements are taken into account in the determination of audit procedures. The
effectiveness of the accounting-related internal control system and the evidence supporting the
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and the group management report are examined
primarily on a test basis within the framework of the audit. The audit includes assessing the annual
financial statements of those entities included in consolidation, the determination of entities to be
included in consolidation, the accounting and consolidation principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial
statements and group management report. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

Our audit has not led to any reservations.

In our opinion, based on the findings of our audit, the consolidated financial statements comply with
IFRSs, as adopted by the EU, the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315a
Abs. 1 HGB and give a true and fair view of the net assets, financial position and results of operations of
the Group in accordance with these requirements. The group management report is consistent with the
consolidated financial statements and as a whole provides a suitable view of the Group’s position and
suitably presents the opportunities and risks of future development.

**B.** **_Notes on the principles and methods underlying the consolidated financial statements_**

**1.** **Principles**

The consolidated financial statements of CinemaxX AG and its subsidiaries (‘‘CinemaxX Group’’) have
been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by
the European Union effective on the balance sheet date. All IFRS to be mandatorily applied in the
European Union for the financial year 2012 were taken into consideration. The requirements of IFRS
were fully satisfied and result in a fair presentation of the net assets, financial position and results of
operations of the CinemaxX Group.

The requirements of Article 4 of Regulation Nr. 1606/2002 of the European Parliament in conjunction with
§ 315a (1) HGB for the exemption from the obligation to prepare consolidated financial statements in
accordance with German commercial law have been fulfilled. All the necessary disclosures and
explanatory notes have been made as per § 315a (1) HGB.

For the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, we assumed that the group will continue as
a going concern. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared based on historical
acquisition and production cost. The presentation currency is in Euro. All amounts are reported in
thousands of euros (KEUR) unless stated otherwise. Rounding differences may therefore arise.

The balance sheet uses a current/non-current classification.

The income statement as a component of the statement of comprehensive income has been prepared in
accordance with the nature of expense method. In order to improve the clarity and informative value,
individual items in the statement of comprehensive income and the balance sheet have been
summarized. Individual items are reported separately and explained in the notes.

**2.** **Accounting principles newly issued by the IASB**

The basis of accounting according to IFRS for the CinemaxX Group are, in accordance with
EU Regulation Nr. 1606/2002 in conjunction with § 315a (1) HGB, the accounting standards issued by
the IASB adopted by the Commission of the European Communities within the framework of the
endorsement process for the European Union. The IFRS and revisions of IFRS newly issued by the IASB
must be mandatorily applied by the CinemaxX Group only after a corresponding decision has been
taken by the Commission in the course of an endorsement process.

-----

18JUN201312290849

The following amendment to a standard was mandatorily adopted for the first time in the financial year
2012:

- In October 2010, the IASB published an amendment to IFRS 7 ‘‘Financial Instruments:
Disclosures’’. The amendment includes disclosure requirements in connection with a transfer of
financial assets.

The application of this amendment did not have an effect on the net assets, financial position and results
of operations of the group.

The following standards and interpretations have already been endorsed by the EU, but are only to be
mandatorily applied at a later date.

- In December 2010 the IASB published an amendment to IAS 12 ‘‘Deferred tax: Recovery of
underlying assets’’. As per IAS 12, any measurement of deferred taxes must consider whether the
temporary difference is reversed by use or by disposal. If the underlying asset is measured at fair
value according to IAS 40, the rebuttable presumption is introduced that the reversal will be realized
by disposal. An application is mandatory for financial years commencing on or after January 1,
2012.

- IFRS 10 ‘‘Consolidated Financial Statements’’ were issued by the IASB in May 2011. IFRS 10
introduces a uniform consolidation model for all companies that takes into account the principle of
control of the subsidiary by the parent company. IFRS 10 also includes consolidation principles
relating to non-controlling shares, potential voting rights and the loss of the control option. The
standard must be mandatorily applied for financial years commencing on or after January 1, 2013,
for those adopting it in the European Union for financial years commencing on or after January 1,
2014.

- IFRS 11 ‘‘Joint Arrangements’’ was also published in May 2011. This replaces IAS 31 ‘‘Interests in
Joint Ventures’’ and regulates the presentation of joint arrangements. Joint arrangements may take
the form of a joint activity or a joint venture. In connection with a joint activity, the assets, liabilities,
income and expenses must be recognized in proportion to the interest, for a joint venture the equity
method must be applied. The current option regarding the inclusion of joint ventures by means of
proportionate consolidation was not included in IFRS 11. The standard must be mandatorily applied
for financial years commencing on or after January 1, 2013, whereby in accordance with IFRS 10 it is
mandatory for adopters in the European Union to apply it for the first time for financial years
commencing on or after January 1, 2014.

- A standard which condenses the revised disclosure requirements contained in IAS 27, IAS 28,
IFRS 10 and IFRS 11 into a single standard was issued in May 2011, namely IFRS 12 ‘‘Disclosures of
Interests in Other Entities’’. IFRS 12 relates to the disclosures on shares in subsidiaries, associated
companies, joint ventures and non-consolidated structured units with the objective of transparently
presenting to users of financial statements the nature, risks and financial effects that are associated
with such interests. The standard must be mandatorily applied for financial years commencing on or
after January 1, 2013 (for adopters in the European Union January 1, 2014).

- IFRS 13 ‘‘Fair Value Measurement’’ was published by the IASB in May 2011 and contains rules for
determining the fair value. Furthermore, IFRS 13 expands the disclosure requirements required in
connection with a fair value measurement. The standard must be mandatorily applied for financial
years commencing on or after January 1, 2013.

- The IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 ‘‘Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income’’ in
June 2011. Thus items under other comprehensive income that are reclassified in subsequent
periods by the income statement must, in the future, be reported separately from those that remain
in other comprehensive income. The standard must be mandatorily applied for financial years
commencing on or after July 1, 2012.

- The IASB has issued an amendment to IAS 19 ‘‘Employee Benefits’’ in June 2011. The amendment
will mainly concern effects on the recording and measurement of the expense for defined benefit

F-104


18JUN201312290849


-----

18JUN201312290849

plans and termination benefits as well as on the disclosure requirements for employee benefits. In
future, actuarial gains and losses must be fully recognized in other comprehensive income in equity
as they occur. Furthermore, the allocation of past service cost over a period until vesting of the
claims is not permitted anymore. The amended standard also contains expanded disclosure
requirements as well as amendments regarding the definition of benefits resulting from termination
of employment. The standard must be mandatorily applied for financial years commencing on or
after January 1, 2013.

- The amendments to IAS 32 ‘‘Financial Instruments’’ clarify the requirements for the offset of financial
assets and financial liabilities. The amendments are mandatory for financial years commencing on
or after January 1, 2014.

- IFRIC 20 regulates the accounting requirements for waste stripping expenses that are incurred
during open-cast mining operations. The interpretation is mandatory for financial years
commencing on or after January 1, 2013.

These regulations are applied in the CinemaxX Group at the time of mandatory application. The
CinemaxX Group currently assumes that the application of that amendment to the standard will not have
a significant impact on the presentation of the net assets, financial position and results of operations of
the CinemaxX Group. The effects of the first-time application of IFRS 10 to 12 depend on the future
acquisition activities of the CinemaxX Group.

The following standards and interpretations published by the IASB and IFRIC still require approval by the
EU before they are applied to IFRS consolidated financial statements pursuant to § 315a HGB:

- The IASB published IFRS 9 ‘‘Financial Instruments’’ in November 2009. IFRS 9, which regulates the
accounting and measurement requirements for financial assets and financial liabilities, represents
the first phase of the project for replacing IAS 39, which is scheduled to take place in three stages.
IFRS 9 replaces previous categories of financial assets with two categories where measurement is
either at fair value or at amortized cost. A measurement at amortized cost requires that the business
model of the company consider the holding of financial assets in order to generate contractual cash
flows from interest and repayment and allot fixed payment dates for cash flows. With regard to the
classification and measurement of financial liabilities, IFRS 9 has essentially adopted the
regulations set forth in IAS 39. IFRS 9 is mandatory for financial years commencing on or after
January 1, 2015.

- In May 2012 the IASB published a limited number of editorial amendments to various standards
which includes IAS 1, IAS 16, IAS 32 and IAS 34 in conjunction with its ‘‘Annual Improvement Project
2009–2011’’. These amendments are mandatory for the first time for financial years commencing on
or after January 1, 2013.

These standards and interpretations will be applied for the subject to recognition by the EU at the time of
first mandatory application. The CinemaxX Group currently assumes that the application of those
standards will not have a significant impact on the presentation of the net assets, financial position and
results of operations of the CinemaxX Group.

**3.** **Basis of Consolidation**

The consolidated financial statements of the Company include all subsidiaries over which CinemaxX AG
is able exercise control. Control within the meaning of IAS 27 is the power to govern the financial and
operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.

Step acquisitions and disposals of subsidiaries’ shares in which control over the respective company or
after the disposal of shares is already attributable to the CinemaxX Group before the acquisition an after
the share disposal are recognized as transactions between shareholders. A resulting difference between
the purchase price of the shares and the share in equity attributable to date to the external shareholder
and the amount to be reallocated to the external shareholder is reported in consolidated equity in the
item ‘‘Adjusting item from shareholder transactions’’. Hidden reserves and charges and the recognition
of goodwill are not disclosed for these transactions.

F-105

18JUN201312290849

Special-purpose entities that own cinema properties are included in IFRS consolidated financial
statements by way of full consolidation, if and to the extent that the business operations of the company
solely comprise the lease of the property and the Group bears the majority of the risks and opportunities.

Equity consolidation for companies acquired by external third parties was carried out at the date of
acquisition using the acquisition method. When the acquisition method is applied, the costs of the
shares acquired are offset against the proportionate fair value of the assets acquired and debts of the
subsidiary at the acquisition date. A positive difference arising from the offsetting is capitalized as
goodwill. Negative differences that result from the equity consolidation at the date of acquisition are
immediately released through the income statement after the values have been reassessed. The date of
acquisition is the date on which the option to exercise control over the net assets and the financial and
operating activities of the acquired company is transferred to the Group.

Interests where the Company holds between 20% and 50% are recognized according to the equity
method, insofar as the Company exercises a significant influence. Cost is increased or reduced annually
by the changes in equity of the associated company attributable to the Group, provided no negative
recognition is calculated as a result.

The financial statements of the domestic and foreign companies included in the consolidated financial
statements are prepared as at the same reporting date as the consolidated financial statements and are
based on uniform accounting and valuation methods.

Intercompany profits and losses, revenue, expenses and income, as well as receivables, liabilities and
provisions between subsidiaries are eliminated. As per IAS 12, deferred taxes are recognized based on
temporary differences resulting from the consolidation.

**4.** **Group of consolidated companies**

The companies included in consolidation are CinemaxX AG and its 10 subsidiaries (prior year: 9) as well
as an associated company (previous year: 1).

The associated company (shareholding of 49%), CAP Kiel Betriebs-GmbH i.L., Kiel, was cancelled in the
commercial register in Kiel on November 8, 2012. In the financial year 2012, the shares held by
CinemaxX Danmark A/S, Copenhagen/Denmark, in kino.dk A/S, Copenhagen/Denmark, were included
in the consolidated financial statements of CinemaxX Aktiengesellschaft using the equity method. The
shareholding of CinemaxX Danmark A/S, Copenhagen/Denmark, amounts to 26% as in prior years. The
share of profit attributable to the past financial years in the amount of KEUR 62 was recognized in profit
or loss in the financial year 2012. Due to its amount, the carrying amount under the equity method and
the share of profits using the equity method are not reported separately, but under non-current other
financial assets and other financial result.

With effect from June 4, 2012, CinemaxX acquired 74.99% of the shares in a shell company operating
under the name of CinemaxX MaxXtainment GmbH from the lessor of the cinema property HannoverRaschplatz which, in turn, rents the property from a third party. Furthermore, the CinemaxX Group was
granted the option, exercisable at any time, to acquire the outstanding shares and the lessor was
granted the option, exercisable at any time, to offer those shares. This option was amended by the
shareholder agreement dated December 28, 2012 in order to enable the lessor to exercise the option on
expiry of December 31, 2019, at the earliest. The purchase price for shares including shares covered by
options is determined by the term of the lease agreement related to the property.

In the course of this share acquisition, a settlement was furthermore reached with the lessor in which the
claims of the CinemaxX Group to a variable component of profit or loss under the agency agreement for
the cinema operated on the property, Hannover-Raschplatz, for the period 2004 to 2011 in the amount of
KEUR 2,042 and the claims of the lessor arising from existing loans against the CinemaxX Group in the
amount of KEUR 1,949 were also covered.

A net payment obligation of KEUR 5,900 results from the share purchase agreement including the
existing options and the settlement. This is derived from the maximum amount to be paid by the
Company of KEUR 7,500 and a payment of KEUR 1,600, which the CinemaxX Group received as part of

F-106


18JUN201312290849


-----

18JUN201312290849

the settlement. The CinemaxX Group made the payment of the first purchase price installment of
KEUR 1,500 in 2012 as well as an further installment payment of KEUR 4,500 in January 2013 after the
transfer of the lease agreement.

In accordance with IFRS 3, the acquisition of shares in CinemaxX MaxXtainment GmbH was not
classified as a business combination, as the Company in its capacity as a shell company cannot be
defined as a ‘‘business’’ within the meaning of IFRS 3. The amount of the payment of the CinemaxX
Group allocated to the acquisition of shares is equivalent to a compensation payment for the transfer of
the lease agreement between lessor and third party and was recognized in the amount of the fair value of
the resulting benefit of KEUR 6,220 in intangible assets.

Furthermore, there was an increase in the investment in CinemaxX Filmtheater GmbH from 91% to 100%
at a purchase price of KEUR 5. The acquisition was presented in group equity as a shareholder
transaction based on the previously existing option to exercise control.

**5.** **Currency conversion**

The reporting currency of the consolidated financial statements is euro, which constitutes the functional
currency of the parent company and the subsidiaries included in the consolidation with the exception of
CinemaxX Danmark A/S, Copenhagen/Denmark, and kino.dk A/S, Copenhagen/Denmark, whose
functional currency is the Danish krone. For conversion into the reporting currency, the assets and
liabilities of the Danish subsidiary are converted at the respective closing rate at each reporting date. The
items in the income statement of the Danish subsidiary are recognized at transaction rates. Differences
resulting from the conversion are treated with no corresponding effect on profit or loss and separately
recognized within equity.

The rates used in the consolidated financial statements for conversion of the items of CinemaxX
Danmark A/S, Copenhagen/Denmark, and kino.dk A/S, Copenhagen/Denmark, developed as follows in
relation to the euro:

**DKK/EUR** **2012** **2011**

Closing rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7.44050 7.4342

**C.** **_General accounting and valuation methods_**

**1.** **Realization of income and expenses**

Revenues and other operating income are generally not realized until the service has been rendered and
the risk has therefore been transferred to the customer. Revenues from the sale of tickets and
concessions are collected by the customer at the time of utilization of the services provided by the
CinemaxX Group. Advertising revenue is realized in profit or loss, provided that the CinemaxX Group has
rendered the agreed advertising services.

In conjunction with the sale of vouchers, a portion of the cash receipts are recognized as revenues
independently of actual utilization based on statistical empirical data on attendance patterns relating to
the probability of redemption.

If customers are awarded prizes in conjunction with the sale of tickets which entitle the customer to free
purchase of other products, a portion of the proceeds resulting from ticket sales will be attributed to the
prize vouchers under consideration of the probability of redemption based on statistical empirical data.
That portion is not collected as sales revenue until the customer redeems his prizes.

Movie rentals are billed weekly in arrears to film distributors. Operating expenses are recognized on the
date of utilization of the services or when they are incurred as expense. Interest income and interest
expenses are recognized in the period in which they occur.

Borrowing costs are recognized as current expenses as is appropriate. Interest for qualifying assets
within the meaning of IAS 23 are not capitalized, as such assets do not exist within the CinemaxX Group.

**2.** **Intangible assets**

Intangible assets acquired for a consideration are recognized at cost less amortization and impairments.
Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, except for goodwill, do not exist. If the value of the asset
decreases, an impairment is recognized. Intangible assets are amortized over the following useful lives:

The results from the sale of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are recognized in other
operating income or expenses.

In the financial year 2012, a reassessment of the useful lives of property, plant and equipment was
performed in the context of the planned comprehensive renovations and investments in the cinemas.
The expected remaining useful lives were adjusted without taking corresponding residual values into
account, as the generation of significant proceeds on disposal could not be assumed. This change led
to an increase in depreciation in 2012 in the amount of KEUR 698.

**4.** **Leases**

CinemaxX AG and its subsidiaries rent and lease properties and equipment for the operation of cinemas.
The accounting of leasing transactions is carried out in accordance with the requirements set forth by
IAS 17. In this regard, it must be differentiated between operating leases and financing leases depending
on the party bearing the significant risks and rewards of ownership. Where the lease is a finance lease,
the lessee maintains beneficial ownership and, thus, capitalizes the leased item. A series of lease
agreements on cinema properties and cinema equipment which satisfy these criteria are in place within
the CinemaxX Group. Therefore, these properties and inventories were capitalized for companies in the
CinemaxX Group. At the same time, finance lease payments were recognized as liabilities.

At the inception of the lease, the group recognized assets and liabilities at the same amount in the
balance sheet at the lower of the fair value of the asset at the inception of the lease and the present value
of the minimum lease payments. The depreciation methods and useful lives of the capitalized assets
correspond to comparable assets acquired in the CinemaxX Group. If the useful life of the asset exceeds
the term of the underlying lease agreement, the asset is depreciated over the lease term.

The resulting payment obligations are recognized as a liability under financial liabilities. The interest
portion of the lease payments is recognized in the income statement over the lease term.

If the criteria set forth in IAS 17 are no longer satisfied due to the amendment of lease agreements, the
affected assets and liabilities are derecognized at the time at which the lease amendment comes into
effect. The difference existing on this date between the carrying amount of the assets and lease liabilities
to be derecognized is recognized in the income statement in other operating income.

18JUN201312290849


-----

18JUN201312290849

Amendments of lease arrangements that do not result in a different classification as per IAS 17, lead to
an adjustment of the liability and the asset in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.

For leases classified as operating leases, the payments to be made by the CinemaxX Group are
recognized straight-line and in connection with underlying key ratios as expenses as is appropriate.

Compensation payments on the assumption of lease agreements that are classified as operating leases
are capitalized as intangible assets and depreciated over the expected lease term.

**5.** **Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets held under finance**
**leases**

The CinemaxX Group reviews the intangible assets and property, plant and equipment to establish
whether impairments are necessary.

An impairment of intangible assets—except for goodwill—property, plant and equipment, and assets in
finance leases is recognized, if and to the extent that, due to certain events or developments, the
carrying amount of the assets no longer exceeds the proceeds expected from the sale of assets or the
discounted net cash flows from further usage. The cash flows are discounted at a cost of capital that is
based on peer group companies. If it is not possible to calculate the recoverable amount for individual
assets, the cash flows are determined for the next highest group of assets for which such cash flows can
be calculated.

Goodwill, for which an impairment test must be conducted at least annually, is, for the performance of
the impairment tests, allocated to the reporting units for which an allocation of the goodwill is also
performed in the internal reporting system of the group. These reporting units correspond to individual
cinemas and groups of cinemas. The cash flows of reporting units are discounted at a cost of capital that
is based on peer group companies. Impairment is recognized if the net present value of the cash flows is
less than the carrying amount of the intangible assets and property, plant and equipment as well as net
current assets of the reporting unit including the allocated goodwill.

The impairment test is performed at the end of the financial year. The post-tax interest rate used in the
financial year 2012 for the discounting of the cash flows of reporting units when calculating the value in
use was 10.75% (prior year: 10.75%). The net cash flow is calculated on the basis of forecasts in the
individual reporting units over a forecast horizon of five years. The relevant forecasts for attendance and
the development of ticket and concession revenue as well as film rentals, in particular, were used to
determine net cash flows. A growth discount of 0% (prior year: 0%) was assumed for the subsequent
period in the interest rate.

Reversals of impairments are recognized when the reason for the impairment no longer applies in
subsequent periods. The reversal may be recognized to a maximum to the amount that would have been
recognized without the impairment. There are no reversal of impairments on impaired goodwill.

**6.** **Financial instruments**

**Hybrid financial instruments**

In the financial year 2008, the company issued convertible bonds which granted holders the right to
convert these financial instruments into shares of CinemaxX AG.

The debt component was recognized at the present value of the future interest payments and
repayments based on the risk-adjusted interest rate of a matching maturity. Subsequently, the debt
component is assessed based on the effective interest rate method.

The equity component is calculated on the date of issue of the hybrid financial instrument as the
difference between the fair value of the hybrid financial instrument and the fair value of the debt
component and recognized in equity reserves in consolidated equity. There is no subsequent
revaluation of the equity component.

F-110


18JUN201312290849


-----

18JUN201312290849

If the hybrid financial instruments are redeemed before maturity, the payment must be allocated to the
equity and debt component. The method that was used in issuing the convertible bond must be applied.
Therefore, the fair value of the liability must be determined, the remaining amount of the payment must
be allocated to the equity component.

**Other financial instruments**

Other financial instruments (financial assets and liabilities) within the meaning of IAS 32 and IAS 39
comprise trade accounts receivable, interests, cash and cash equivalents, current and non-current
loans, trade accounts payable as well as certain other financial assets and liabilities based on
contractual agreements.

Financial instruments are recognized at amortized cost or at fair value. For current receivables and
liabilities, amortized cost is generally equivalent to the nominal amount or the settlement amount. The
fair value is generally equivalent to the market value or quoted share price. If an active market does not
exist, the fair value can be determined using financial mathematical methods. Should a fair value
measurement not be possible, assets are measured at cost.

On each balance sheet date, it is reviewed to determine objective evidence exists that the financial asset
or group of financial assets is impaired.

Financial assets are classified within the CinemaxX Group as follows:

- loans and receivables

- available-for-sale financial assets

As per IAS 39, shares in investments are classified for valuation purposes in the category
‘‘available-for-sale financial assets’’. Available-for-sale financial assets are recognized at the balance
sheet date at fair value or, if this is cannot be determined or not reliably determined, at cost. As the fair
values of investments cannot be determined due to an absence of quoted share price or lack of
appropriate valuation methods, these shares are recognized at cost.

Impairments on receivables and other ordinary financial assets that are allocated to the category ‘‘loans
and receivables’’ are usually recognized using impairment accounts. Impairments are recognized if
objective evidence exists that the financial asset may be exposed to a risk of default. The amount of the
impairment is determined by historical values or individual estimates of risk.

The classification depends on the respective purpose for which the financial assets were acquired.
Management determines the classification of financial assets on initial recognition and reviews the
classification at each reporting date.

At initial recognition financial liabilities are recognized at their fair values under consideration of market
interest rates. The subsequent measurement is at amortized cost using the effective interest method. As
per IAS 17.25, interest accruing on finance lease liabilities is determined by the effective interest rate.

Financial assets are derecognized if either the rights to the cash flows that can be generated from the
assets have become voided or the significant risks are transferred to a third party in such manner that the
criteria for derecognition are fulfilled.

Financial liabilities are derecognized if contractual obligations have been settled, annulled or have
expired. Financial liabilities are derecognized when a change to significant conditions causes a
significant change to the cash flows associated with the repayment or return. A new financial liability is
recognized at the point at which the adjustment comes into force at fair value plus any directly
attributable transaction costs. Differences between the carrying amount of the derecognized liability are
recognized in the interest result in the income statement.

The fair values of the financial instruments are determined on the basis of corresponding market values
or valuations methods. The fair values of liquid assets and other current primary financial instruments
correspond to the carrying amounts recognized on the respective reporting dates.

F-111


18JUN201312290849


-----

18JUN201312290849

The fair value of non-current financial assets and liabilities is determined based on the expected cash
flows using the reference interest rates valid at the balance sheet date.

**7.** **Income taxes**

Current taxes are recognized as an expense at the time of their occurrence in the amount of the sum due.

Deferred taxes are recognized on future tax consequences of temporary differences between tax bases
of assets and liabilities and their IFRS carrying amounts as for loss carryforwards. Deferred taxes are
measured based on regulations issued by the regulatory authorities at the end of the respective financial
year for the financial years in which the differences will be reversed or the loss carryforwards are likely to
be utilized. Deferred tax assets on temporary differences and loss carryforwards are only recognized to
the extent that it is sufficiently probably that they will be realized in the near future, either due to sufficient
taxable temporary differences or because it is probable that the companies recognizing tax loss
carryforwards will generate sufficient taxable profit against which the tax loss carryforwards can be
utilized.

Deferred taxes are recognized on temporary differences that result from the recognition of assets and
liabilities at fair value in the context of business combinations. Deferred taxes are only recognized on
temporary differences for goodwill if the goodwill can be deducted for tax purposes.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset if and to the extent that the deferred taxes relate to taxes
from income that are levied by the same tax authorities and the taxes can be offset against each other.

**8.** **Inventories**

Inventories largely consist of concession products. Concession products are recognized at the lower of
cost and net realizable value as of the balance sheet date.

**9.** **Provisions**

Provisions include, as per IAS 37, for all identifiable obligations towards third parties arising on past
events, the settlement of which is expected to result in an outflow of funds and a reliable estimate of the
amount of the obligation can be made.

As per IAS 37, provisions are recognized at the expected settlement amount. The present value of the
expected settlement amount of non-current provisions is determined on the basis of market interest
rates.

**10. Government Grants**

The CinemaxX Group received government grants for assets. Government grants are only recognized,
as per IAS 20, if there is reasonable assurance that the associated conditions will be met and the grants
awarded. Expense-related grants are recognized as income over the period in which the corresponding
expenses will be incurred in order to offset such expenses.

Furthermore, the FFA provides companies of the CinemaxX Group with interest-free loans that have a
maximum term of ten years.

These loans are recognized when granted at fair value and subsequently amortized using the effective
interest rate method.

**11. Use of assumptions and estimates**

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, assumptions and estimates have been used that
have impacted the presentation and amount of the recognized assets, liabilities, income, expenses and
contingent liabilities. These assumptions and estimates essentially include to the assessment of
impairment of goodwill (KEUR 1,423), the group-wide determination of the useful lives for intangible
assets with a definite useful life and property, plant and equipment including the assets held under
finance leases (KEUR 90,848), the measurement of provisions (KEUR 3,558) und voucher liabilities

F-112


18JUN201312290849

18JUN201312290849

(KEUR 13,882) as well as the realizability of future tax benefits, in particular from the use of tax loss
carryforwards, that are recognized as deferred tax assets (KEUR 19,497).

In the case of voucher liabilities, it is currently assumed on the basis on statistical historical values that
there is an 85% probability of the issued vouchers being redeemed.

In classifying and capitalizing lease agreements, some estimate parameters were applied.

When capitalizing deferred taxes for loss carryforwards, the estimates made in the group business plan
for the period from 2013 to 2017 was used to assess its realizability. Due to the transfer of control to
CinemaxX Aktiengesellschaft, the amount of the hidden reserves existing at the time of the transfer on
the basis of which a business valuation is determined is also relevant.

In individual cases, the actual values may deviate from the assumptions and estimates made. Changes
are recognized once better knowledge is acquired.

All estimates and assessments are continuously re-evaluated and are based on historic experiences and
other factors including expectations regarding future events which seem reasonable under the existing
conditions.

The group makes estimates and assumptions that concern the future. Naturally, the resulting estimates
will seldom be exactly equivalent to subsequent actual circumstances.

**12. Contingent liabilities**

Contingent liabilities are potential obligations resulting from past events and whose existence depends
on future events that are not controlled by the company as well as existing obligations that cannot be
recognized as liabilities, because either an outflow of resources is improbable or the amount of the
obligation cannot be estimated in a sufficiently reliable manner. Such contingent liabilities are disclosed
with their scope of liability prevailing on the balance sheet date.

Software, ticket software and concession software as well as compensation payments on the
assumption lease agreements are combined under the item ‘‘Software and other intangible assets’’.

Additions of KEUR 6,220 relate to the acquisition of shares in CinemaxX MaxXtainment GmbH that, as
per IFRS 3, are not classified as a business combination, as the company, in its capacity as a shell
company, cannot be defined as a ‘‘business’’. The amount attributable to the acquisition corresponds to
a compensation payment on the assumption of the lease agreement between the lessor and third party
and was recognized at the fair value of the resulting benefit.

Goodwill resulted from the acquisition of the formerly independent reporting units Broadway Filmtheater
Betriebs Gesellschaft mbH (KEUR 790)—related to the cinema operation at Holi, Hamburg—and the
Berliner Filmtheater Knapp GmbH & Co. KG (KEUR 633)—related to the cinema operation at Potsdamer
Platz, Berlin—and is classified under the domestic segment. In order to perform the impairment test,
goodwill has been allocated to the individual reporting units (cash generating units) to which derivative
goodwill in the internal control of the group is allocated. The allocation is performed for the recognized
goodwill at the level of individual cinemas or groups of cinemas. The performance of the impairment test
as of December 31, 2012 did not result in any impairment. An impairment would also not have occurred if
the significant parameters had deteriorated within the conceivable thresholds.

The finance leases concerning cinema properties have a fixed agreed minimum term of lease of between
20 and 30 years. The CinemaxX Group has the right, at some locations, to extend the lease agreement
by five years under similar conditions. A majority of the leases provide for fixed and attendancedependent rents as well as price index adjustments.

In the case of four real estate lease agreements and six equipment lease agreements, the present value
of the minimum lease installments largely covers the costs incurred by the lessor (present value
criterion). The CinemaxX Group is therefore the beneficial owner of these assets. A useful life of the
cinema properties of 40 years and useful lives of equipment of between eight and 20 years was used for
assessing the present value criterion. Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter
of the useful life and remaining term of the underlying lease agreement.

Trade receivables are receivables deriving from special events, voucher and film canister sales, barter
transactions, marketing of advertising spaces such as posters, program folders and admission tickets as
well as promotions.

A receivable arose on the sale of the interior fittings following the transfer of a cinema in 2003. The
settlement of this receivable is contingent on various conditions, the fulfillment of which can currently be
classified as insufficiently probable; thus, the receivable was impaired in 2003.

**8.** **Equity**

The development of the consolidated equity over the financial years 2012 and 2011 is shown in the
consolidated statement of changes in equity to which reference is made.

The fully called up and registered share capital of CinemaxX AG as of December 31, 2012 was
EUR 26,962,291.00 (2011-12-31: EUR 26,962,291.00) and is divided into 26,962,291 no-par shares at a
nominal value of EUR 1.00 each. All shares are bearer stock.

At the annual shareholders’ meeting on June 25, 2009, authorized share capital of EUR 11,990,000.00
was resolved. The entry of the amendment to the articles of association was made on July 16, 2009. The
authorized share capital amounts as of December 31, 2012 to EUR 8,737,709 due to the increase in
share capital in 2010 using authorized share capital.

At the shareholders’ meeting held on November 30, 2006, it was resolved to issue convertible bonds and
create contingent capital. The convertible bonds were divided into 2,683,438 bearer partial debentures
with equal rights with a nominal value of EUR 1.00 each. The convertible bonds were issued in return for

F-118


18JUN201312290849


-----

18JUN201312290849

a payment in kind by transferring the respective receivables of the creditor due from CinemaxX
Cinema GmbH & Co. KG. Each one euro receivable corresponds to a partial debenture of Euro 1.00.

In order to execute the convertible bonds, a resolution was passed at the shareholders’ meeting on
November 30, 2006 regarding contingent capital, which provides for a contingent increase in share
capital of up to EUR 894,480.00 by issuing up to 894,480 shares (‘‘contingent capital 2006’’). The
contingent capital used to service the convertible bonds was entered in the commercial register of the
Company on March 26, 2007 and conferred on the holders of the convertible bond the right to purchase
a common share of the Company at a nominal value of EUR 3.00.

By agreement of February 15 and March 14, 2008, respectively, the Company agreed with a lessor to
transfer deferred rental liabilities converted to a loan due to CinemaxX Cinema GmbH & Co. KG in the
amount of KEUR 2,683 to CinemaxX AG in return for the issue of convertible bonds in the nominal
amount of KEUR 2,683. The convertible bonds accrued interest at 0.5% p.a. and conferred on holders of
bonds the right to request, on a one-time basis on September 30, 2013, the repayment of the nominal
amount of KEUR 2,683 plus a premium of 12.5%.

By agreement of May 21 and June 4, 2012, respectively, the parties concerned agreed to settle the
existing convertible bonds with a nominal value of KEUR 2,683 by repayment of the bonds before
maturity. CinemaxX AG repaid the convertible debt at its nominal value and an additional premium of
7.5% on June 18, 2012. The repayment was recognized as a decrease in equity of KEUR 64, as per
IAS 32.

After repayment of the bond, the shareholders’ meeting held on August 30, 2012 re-solved to cancel the
contingent capital 2006 and delete para. 4 in § 4 (Contingent Capital 2006) of the articles of association
of CinemaxX AG without replacement. The last entry was completed on September 13, 2012.

**Equity reserves of KEUR 8,291 were blocked from distribution in accordance with commercial law and**
stock corporation law provisions.

**9.** **Goodwill offset with equity reserves in prior years**

Goodwill which arose on the initial consolidation of five subsidiaries in accordance with the provisions of
German commercial law in the period 1997 to 2001, was offset with equity reserves in accordance with
the German accounting regulations applied at the time of initial consolidation in the amount of
KEUR 62,670 recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.

In adopting IFRS for financial reporting, CinemaxX AG exercised the option set forth in IFRS 1, whereby a
retroactive application of IFRS 3 to business combinations that occurred prior to the reporting date of the
IFRS opening balance sheet (January 1, 2004) may be waived. The offsetting of the goodwill was
therefore retained for the above-mentioned five companies.

**10. Minority interests**

Non-controlling interests relate to the shares of other shareholders in the equity and the earnings derived
from CinemaxX Danmark A/S, Copenhagen.

During the 2012 financial year there was an increase in the interest in CinemaxX Filmtheater GmbH from
91% to 100% at a purchase price of KEUR 5. That acquisition was presented in group equity as a

The bank loan in the amount of KEUR 10,000 with a term of up to December 30, 2015, borrowed in 2010,

which took place in the financial year, the loan provider exercised its right to terminate and claim full
repayment of the loan. The repayment amount totalled KEUR 7,059 plus a prepayment fee of KEUR 238.

The carrying amount of the installment-purchase agreement for cinema equipment with a remaining
term of 42 months and monthly installments of KEUR 29 amounts to KEUR 786 as of December 31, 2012
(prior year: KEUR 1,079).

Other interest in 2012 includes prepayment penalties in relation to the early repayment of a bank loan of
KEUR 238.

**10. Income tax**

Income tax includes all tax liabilities in individual countries or tax burdens arising on income, as well as
deferred taxes. Income tax includes, thereby, trade tax, corporation tax, a solidarity surcharge, and any
relevant international income tax.

For German companies subject to corporation tax, a corporation tax rate of 15.0% as well as the
solidarity surcharge of 5.5% on the corporation tax applies. Additionally, these companies as well as
domestic companies in the legal form of partnership are subject to trade earnings tax, the amount of
which is determined by the specific applicable municipal assessment rate. For corporations trade tax no
longer reduces the basis of assessment for corporation tax.

Tax income (+)/expense (�) arising on income tax is classified by origin as follows:

**In KEUR** **2012** **2011**

The notional expense for income taxes that would have resulted with the application of the tax rate of the
parent company CinemaxX AG of 32.28% (prior year: 32.28%) to the IFRS pre-tax consolidated income

**Tax expense as per income statement . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** �10,226 �5,552

The deferred taxes are determined based on tax rates that apply under current law in Germany and are
expected at the time of realization. A tax rate of 32.28% which consists of the corporation tax rate of
15.0%, the solidarity surcharge of 5.5% and the trade tax rate of 16.45% applicable in Hamburg was used
for the calculation both in 2011 and 2012. Companies in the legal form of a partnership are subject to
trade tax.

The trade tax no longer reduces their own basis of assessment and, in the case of corporations, no
longer reduces the basis of assessment for corporation tax. On the basis of the minimum taxation rate,
the tax losses carried forward in Germany can only be used to a limited degree. This requires an
unlimited positive tax basis of assessment of up to EUR 1 million, additional amounts of a maximum of
60% must be reduced by an existing loss carried forward.

The effects of different tax rates for partnerships and for domestic and international taxes on the parent
company’s tax rate are recognized in the reconciliation as varying tax rates.

The trade tax additions and reductions largely result from the addition of interest and rents for the use of
external moveable and immovable operational assets.

The tax effects from adjustments to deferred taxes essentially relate to the derecognition of deferred tax
assets on tax losses carried forward recognized to date, as these tax losses carried forward of the
companies domiciled in Germany in part in accordance with the provisions of the income tax laws are
lost due to the direct change in ownership of the group and can no longer be offset against future gains.

Deferred tax assets are recognized on temporary differences and tax losses carried forward if their
realization seems certain in the near future. Deferred taxes on losses carried forward are capitalized to
the extent that the group has sufficient taxable temporary differences or where it is probable that the
affected companies will achieve sufficient taxable results over the course of subsequent years against
which the tax losses carried forward may be offset.

As of December 31, 2012 the group has available, in perpetuity, corporation tax losses carried forward of
KEUR 82,248 (prior year: KEUR 122,817) and trade tax losses carried forward of KEUR 24,482 (previous
year: KEUR 42,705).

As of December 31, 2012 deferred tax assets were not recognized on tax losses carried forward for
corporation tax purposes in the amount of KEUR 18 (prior year: KEUR 8,297) and for trade tax purposes
in the amount of KEUR 20 (prior year: KEUR 6,379), as their realization does not appear sufficiently
probable over the coming years. Current tax law allows tax losses and interest relief to be carried forward
indefinitely.

In the course of the 2nd quarter of 2012 the previous principal shareholder of CinemaxX
Aktiengesellschaft increased its share in the company to 84.59% and subsequently transferred it to the
Vue group. As per § 8c (1) (1) (2) Corporation Tax Act [KStG], this share acquisition is a tax-detrimental
change in ownership which would lead to a full cancellation in tax losses carried forward, unless the
losses are covered by taxable hidden reserves at individual company level (§ 8c (1) (6-8) KStG).

As of December 31, 2012 the CinemaxX Group expected a cancellation of corporation tax losses carried
forward of KEUR 18,000 which led to a reduction in deferred tax assets by KEUR 2,850.

**11. Earnings per Share**

In order to determine the earnings per share according to IAS 33, the consolidated income attributable to
the shareholders is divided by the weighted average of the shares. The number of shares in the financial
year 2012 amounted to 26,962,291.

Diluted earnings per share is equivalent to basic earnings per share, as the conversion rights
outstanding until repayment of the convertible bond did not have a dilutory effect.

For the determination of the diluted earnings per share, the weighted number of shares that might be
issued on conversion of the convertible bonds was included until the date of the repayment of the
convertible bond.

**2.** **Financial risk management**

**_Market risks_**

_a)_ _Foreign exchange risk_

In the course of its business activities, the CinemaxX Group is only to an insignificant extent subject to
foreign exchange risks, as the transactions were almost exclusively made in the functional currency of
the affiliates. Only marginal foreign exchange risks exist in terms of the exchange rate between the
Danish crown and the euro.

F-130


18JUN201312290849


-----

18JUN201312290849

Due to the insignificant role of the foreign exchange risk, it was decided not to conduct a sensitivity
analysis.

_b)_ _Interest rate risk_

The interest rate risk relates to the sensitivity of financial assets and liabilities in connection with changes
to the market interest rate. The CinemaxX Group generally pursues a security-oriented financing policy
where long-term fixed rate arrangements, if available, are usually made for the group. In the financial
year financing was largely carried out by means of interest-bearing loans from banks, prepayments by
advertising customers and advertising administrators as well as from other operating cash flow. To the
extent that the CinemaxX Group enters into interest rate risks in the course of financing, these are not
hedged. No derivative financial instruments for interest hedging exist as at the balance sheet date.

As the group only had outstanding fixed interest-bearing obligations at the cut-off date, a sensitivity
analysis was not performed.

_c)_ _Default risk_

Due to operating activities, significant revenues are effected by means of cash deposits. Here the risk of
default is limited to monetary transactions that are covered by taking out insurance policies. Significant
receivables are created throughout the year against advertisers. To this end, the business model
provided for prepayments by advertisers until the end of 2010 which are balanced by offsetting against
services performed throughout the year. Therefore, there was no default risk. The CinemaxX Group
achieved a significant improvement in the revenue situation through the takeover of the marketing for all
own media by a new department. However, this is contrasted with a higher liquidity risk, as large parts of
the marketing revenue were guaranteed by advertising agents the in the past.

Individual impairments amount to KEUR 944 (prior year: KEUR 990). This essentially relates to a
receivable derived from the sale of equipment against a cinema operator who had taken over the
business operations of a CinemaxX cinema. The probable default risk is recognized by the values shown
in the balance sheet. If the counterparty defaults, a maximum risk of default in the amount of the
respective carrying amount consists of trade receivables (carrying amount KEUR 12,052) and other
financial assets (carrying amount KEUR 2,884).

The impairments on trade accounts receivable developed as follows:

**In KEUR** **2012** **2011**

As at January 1 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 990 1,142

**As at December 31 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **944** **990**

Individual impairments of trade receivables are determined by case-by-case examinations and fluctuate
between 50% and 100% of the original receivable. General impairments are not recognized.

All instruments for which payments had already been contractually agreed on December 31, 2012 were
included in the portfolio. Financial liabilities that are repayable at any time are always allocated to the
earliest timeframe.

**3.** **Capital management**

The capital management of the CinemaxX Group can, in particular, accommodate the creation of a solid
capital basis. The management board regularly reviews net debt. The following table shows equity and
net financial debt:
**31 DEC** **31 DEC**
**2012** **2011**

Equity in KEUR . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 52,299 45,125

Net financial debt in KEUR . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . �23,763 �35,972

The net financial debt is determined from the difference between financial liabilities and liquid assets.

In particular, the company does not have any obligations to sell or otherwise issue shares in connection
with existing share-based compensation schemes. With regard to the authorized and contingent capital,

**Translation of Auditor’s report**

We have audited the consolidated financial statements, comprising the consolidated statement of
comprehensive income, the consolidated balance sheet, the consolidated statement of changes in
equity, the consolidated statement of cash flows, the notes to the consolidated financial statements, and
the combined management and group management report (group management report) of CinemaxX
Aktiengesellschaft, Hamburg, for the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2011. The
preparation of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report in accordance
with IFRS, as adopted by the European Union (EU), and the additional provisions of German commercial
law pursuant to § 315a (1) HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch „German Commercial Code‘‘], is the responsibility
of the Parent Company’s management board. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
consolidated financial statements and on the group management report based on our audit.

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with § 317 HGB

[„Handelsgesetzbuch‘‘: „German Commercial Code‘‘] and German generally accepted standards for
the audit of financial statements promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr¨ufer [Institute of Public
Auditors in Germany] (IDW). These standards require that we plan and perform the audit such that
misstatements materially affecting the presentation of the net assets, financial position and results of
operations in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with applicable accounting
regulations and in the group management report are detected with reasonable assurance. Knowledge of
the business activities and the economic and legal environment of the Group and evaluations of possible
misstatements are taken into account in the determination of audit procedures. The effectiveness of the
accounting-related internal control system and the evidence supporting the disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements and group management report are examined primarily on a test basis
within the framework of the audit. The audit includes assessing the financial statements of the
companies included in the consolidated financial statements, the determination of the scope of
consolidation, the accounting and consolidation principles used, and significant estimates made by the
management board, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial
statements and group management report. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

Our audit has not led to any reservations.

In our opinion, based on the findings of our audit, the consolidated financial statements comply with
IFRSs, as adopted by the EU, the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315a
Abs. 1 HGB and give a true and fair view of the net assets, financial position and results of operations of
the Group in accordance with these requirements. The group management report is consistent with the
consolidated financial statements and as a whole provides a suitable view of the Group’s position and
suitably presents the opportunities and risks of future development.

**A.** **_General information_**

CinemaxX Aktiengesellschaft (‘‘CinemaxX AG’’ or the ‘‘Company’’) has its legal seat in 20354 Hamburg,
Valentinskamp 18–20, Federal Republic of Germany, and operates 30 multiplex cinemas and one
traditional cinema in Germany as well as three multiplex cinemas in Denmark.

CinemaxX AG is registered in the company register of the local court of Hamburg under HRB 67787. The
consolidated financial statements and the group management report of CinemaxX AG will be published
in the electronic Federal Gazette.

The shares of CinemaxX AG are admitted to trading on the regulated market on the Frankfurt/Main,
Berlin, D¨usseldorf, Hamburg, Stuttgart stock exchanges as well as to Xetra trading.

**B.** **_Notes on the principles and methods underlying the consolidated financial statements_**

**1.** **Principles**

The consolidated financial statements of CinemaxX AG and its subsidiaries (‘‘CinemaxX Group’’) have
been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by
the European Union effective on the balance sheet date. All IFRS to be mandatorily applied in the
European Union for the financial year 2011 were taken into consideration. The requirements of IFRS
were fully satisfied and result in a fair presentation of the net assets, financial position and results of
operations of the CinemaxX Group.

The requirements of Article 4 of Regulation Nr. 1606/2002 of the European Parliament in conjunction with
§ 315a (1) HGB for the exemption from the obligation to prepare consolidated financial statements in
accordance with German commercial law have been fulfilled. All the necessary disclosures and
explanatory notes have been made as per § 315a (1) HGB.

For the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, we assumed that the group will continue as
a going concern. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared based on historical
acquisition and production cost. The presentation currency is in Euro. All amounts are reported in
thousands of euros (KEUR) unless stated otherwise. Rounding differences may therefore arise.

The balance sheet uses a current/non-current classification.

The income statement as a component of the statement of comprehensive income has been prepared in
accordance with the nature of expense method. In order to improve the clarity and informative value,
individual items in the statement of comprehensive income and the balance sheet have been
summarized. Individual items are reported separately and explained in the notes.

**2.** **Accounting principles newly issued by the IASB**

The basis of accounting according to IFRS for the CinemaxX Group are, in accordance with EU
Regulation Nr. 1606/2002 in conjunction with § 315a (1) HGB, the accounting standards issued by the
IASB adopted by the Commission of the European Communities within the framework of the
endorsement process for the European Union. The IFRS and revisions of IFRS newly issued by the IASB
must be mandatorily applied by the CinemaxX Group only after a corresponding decision has been
taken by the Commission in the course of an endorsement process.

The following Standards and Interpretations were mandatorily adopted for the first time in the financial
year 2011:

- The changes to IAS 32 ‘‘Classification of Rights Issues’’ address the classification of granted
subscription rights, options and warrants on the acquisition of a fixed number of own shares at a
fixed amount in an arbitrary currency.

- In November 2009, the IASB adopted a change to IAS 24 ‘‘Related Party Disclosures’’. The changes
include a simplification in the definition of related parties. Furthermore companies for which a public
authority exerts control, joint control or significant influence, the disclosure requirements for

F-149


18JUN201312290849


-----

18JUN201312290849

transactions with related parties have been substantially reduced for related parties of this public
authority.

- The IASB’s third project to improve IFRS (‘‘Annual Improvements Project’’) was completed in May
2010 with the publication of various changes and editorial adjustments on 20 existing IFRS.

- In November 2009, IFRIC 19 ‘‘Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments’’ was
published, which regulates the recognition of extinguishments of liabilities on the balance sheet
arising on the issuance of equity instruments in the course of renegotiation of credit terms.

The application of these standards did not have an effect on the net assets, financial position and results
of operations of the group.

In October 2010, the IASB published an amendment to IFRS 7 ‘‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’’. The
amendment includes disclosure requirements in connection with a transfer of financial assets. The
amendment must be applied for financial years commencing on or after July 1, 2011. It has already been
endorsed by the EU. This regulation must be applied in the CinemaxX Group at the time of mandatory
application. The CinemaxX Group currently assumes that the application of that amendment to the
standard will not have a significant impact on the presentation of the net assets, financial position and
results of operations of the CinemaxX Group.

The following standards and interpretations published by the IASB and IFRIC still require approval by the
EU before they are applied to IFRS consolidated financial statements pursuant to § 315a HGB:

- In November 2009, the IASB published IFRS 9 ‘‘Financial Instruments’’. IFRS 9, which regulates the
accounting and measurement requirements for financial assets and financial liabilities, represents
the first phase of the project for replacing IAS 39, which is scheduled to take place in three stages.
IFRS 9 replaces previous categories of financial assets with two categories where measurement is
either at fair value or at amortized cost. A measurement at amortized cost requires that the business
model of the company consider the holding of financial assets in order to generate contractual cash
flows from interest and repayment and allot fixed payment dates for cash flows. With regard to the
classification and measurement of financial liabilities, IFRS 9 has essentially adopted the
regulations set forth in IAS 39. IFRS 9 is mandatory for financial years commencing on or after
January 1, 2015.

- In December 2010 the IASB published an amendment to IAS 12 ‘‘Deferred tax: Recovery of
underlying assets’’. As per IAS 12, any measurement of deferred taxes must consider whether the
temporary difference is reversed by use or by disposal. If the underlying asset is measured at fair
value according to IAS 40, the rebuttable presumption is introduced that the reversal will be realized
by disposal. An application is mandatory for financial years commencing on or after January 1,
2012.

- IFRS 10 ‘‘Consolidated Financial Statements’’ was issued by the IASB in May 2011. IFRS 10
introduces a uniform consolidation model for all companies that take into account the principle of
control of the subsidiary by the parent company. IFRS 10 also includes consolidation principles
relating to non-controlling shares, potential voting rights and the loss of the control. The standard
must be applied for financial years commencing on or after January 1, 2013.

- In May 2011, IFRS 11 ‘‘Joint Arrangements’’ was published. This replaces IAS 31 ‘‘Interests in Joint
Ventures’’ and regulates the presentation of joint arrangements. Joint arrangements may take the
form of a joint activity or a joint venture. In connection with a joint activity, the assets, liabilities,
income and expenses must be recognized in proportion to the interest, for a joint venture the equity
method must be applied. The current option regarding the inclusion of joint ventures by means of
proportionate consolidation was not included in IFRS 11. The standard must be applied for financial
years commencing on or after January 1, 2013.

- IFRS 12 ‘‘Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities’’ was released in May 2011 and updated the
disclosure requirements of IAS 27, IAS 28, IFRS 10 and IFRS 11, summarizing them in one standard.
IFRS 12 relates to the disclosures on shares in subsidiaries, associated companies, joint ventures

F-150


18JUN201312290849


-----

18JUN201312290849

and non-consolidated structured units with the objective of transparently presenting to users of
financial statements the nature, risks and financial effects that are associated with such interests.
The standard must be applied for financial years commencing on or after January 1, 2013.

- IFRS 13 ‘‘Fair Value Measurement’’ was published by the IASB in May 2011 and contains rules for
determining the fair value. Furthermore, IFRS 13 expands the disclosure requirements required in
connection with a fair value measurement. The standard must be applied for financial years
commencing on or after January 1, 2013.

- The IASB released changes to IAS 1 ‘‘Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income’’ in
June 2011. Thus, items under other comprehensive income that are reclassified in subsequent
periods by the income statement must, in the future, be reported separately from those that remain
in other comprehensive income. The standard must be applied for financial years commencing on
or after July 1, 2012.

- In June 2011, the IASB released a change to IAS 19 ‘‘Employee Benefits’’. The amendment will
mainly concern effects on the recording and measurement of the expense for defined benefit plans
and termination benefits as well as on the disclosure requirements for employee benefits. In future,
actuarial gains and losses must be fully recognized in other comprehensive income in equity as
they occur. Furthermore, the distribution of past service cost over a period until vesting of the claims
is not permitted anymore. The standard must be applied for financial years commencing on or after
January 1, 2013.

- The amendments to IAS 32 ‘‘Financial Instruments’’ present the requirements for the offset of
financial assets and financial liabilities. The amendments are mandatory for financial years
commencing on or after January 1, 2014.

- IFRIC 20 regulates the accounting requirements for waste stripping expenses that are incurred
during open-cast mining operations. The interpretation is mandatory for financial years
commencing on or after January 1, 2013.

These standards and interpretations will be applied subject to endorsement by the EU at the time of first
mandatory application. The CinemaxX Group currently assumes that the application of those standards
will not have a significant impact on the presentation of the net assets, financial position and results of
operations of the CinemaxX Group.

**3.** **Basis of Consolidation**

The consolidated financial statements of the Company include all subsidiaries over which CinemaxX AG
is able exercise control. Control within the meaning of IAS 27 is the power to govern the financial and
operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.

Step acquisitions and disposals of shares at subsidiaries in which control over the respective company
or after the disposal of shares is already attributable to the CinemaxX Group before the acquisition and
after the share disposal are recognized as transactions between shareholders. A resulting difference
between the purchase price of the shares and the share in equity attributable to date to the external
shareholder and the amount to be reallocated to the external shareholder is reported in consolidated
equity in the item ‘‘Adjusting item from shareholder transactions’’. Hidden reserves and charges and the
recognition of goodwill are not disclosed for these transactions.

Special-purpose entities that own cinema properties are included in IFRS consolidated financial
statements by way of full consolidation, if and to the extent that the business operations of the company
solely comprise the lease of the property and the group bears the majority of the risks and opportunities.

Equity consolidation for companies acquired by external third parties was carried out at the date of
acquisition using the purchase method. When the purchase method is applied, the costs of the shares
acquired are offset against the proportionate fair value of the assets acquired and debts of the subsidiary
at the acquisition date. A positive difference arising from the offsetting is capitalized as goodwill.
Negative differences that result from capital consolidation at the date of acquisition are immediately

F-151


18JUN201312290849


-----

18JUN201312290849

released through the income statement after the values have been reassessed. The date of acquisition is
the date on which the option to exercise control over the net assets and the financial and operating
activities of the acquired company is transferred to the group.

Interests where the Company holds between 20% and 50% are recognized according to the equity
method, insofar as the Company exercises a significant influence. Cost is increased or reduced annually
by the changes in equity of the associated company attributable to the group, provided no negative
recognition is calculated as a result.

The financial statements of the domestic and foreign companies included in the consolidated financial
statements are prepared as at the same reporting date as the consolidated financial statements and are
based on uniform accounting and valuation methods.

Intercompany profits and losses, revenue, expenses and income, as well as receivables, liabilities and
provisions between subsidiaries are eliminated. As per IAS 12, deferred taxes are recognized based on
temporary differences resulting from the consolidation.

**4.** **Group of consolidated companies**

10 subsidiaries are included in consolidation (prior year: 19) as well as one associate (prior year: one).

In the financial year 2011, the following restructuring occurred in the CinemaxX Group:

— Merger into CinemaxX Movietainment GmbH (previously CinemaxX W¨urzburg GmbH)

  - CinemaxX M¨unchen GmbH & Co. KG

  - CinemaxX M¨unchen Verwaltungs-GmbH

  - Berliner Filmtheater GmbH & Co. KG

  - Verwaltung Berliner Filmtheater GmbH

  - Broadway Filmtheater Betriebs Gesellschaft mbH

— Merger into CinemaxX Entertainment GmbH & Co. KG

  - CallmaxX Tickets & Services GmbH

  - Cine Sales & Services GmbH

  - Einundf¨unfzigste „BEATRICE‘‘ Verm¨ogensverwaltungsgesellschaft mbH

In the course of the restructuring of the articles of incorporation and financial restructuring of the special
purpose entity Multiplex Kino GmbH & Co Objekt Veitsh¨ochheimer Straße KG, which is included in the
consolidated financial statements of CinemaxX AG, 94.5% of the shares in the special purpose entity and
the property in which the cinema is operated were disposed of with effect from July 1, 2011. The

The property Multiplex W¨urzburg is leased by the special purpose entity to a group company. During the
financial year 2011, rental expenses of KEUR 350 were incurred since the deconsolidation on July 1,
2011.

In this connection shares in the F¨unfzigste „BEATRICE‘‘ Verm¨ogensverwaltungsgesellschaft mbH were
disposed of at carrying amount and the company was deconsolidated.

During the financial year 2011, the liquidation of the Big Screen Cinema Projektgesellschaft mbH i.L. was
completed and the company was deleted from the commercial register. The Company was
deconsolidated. No profit or loss occurred on deconsolidation.

**5.** **Currency conversion**

The presentation currency of the consolidated financial statements is euro, which represents the
functional currency of the parent company and the included subsidiaries with the exception of CinemaxX
Danmark A/S, Copenhagen/Denmark, whose functional currency is the Danish krone. For conversion
into the reporting currency, the assets and liabilities of the Danish subsidiary are converted at the
respective closing rate at each reporting date. The items in the income statement of the Danish
subsidiary are recognized at transaction rates. Differences resulting from the conversion are treated with
no corresponding effect on profit or loss and separately recognized within equity.

The rates used in the consolidated financial statements for conversion of the items of CinemaxX
Danmark A/S, Copenhagen/Denmark, developed as follows in relation to the euro:

**DKK/EUR** **2011** **2010**

**C.** **_General accounting and valuation methods_**

**1.** **Realization of income and expenses**

Revenue and other operating income are generally not realized until the service has been rendered and
the risk has therefore been transferred to the customer. Income from the sale of tickets and concessions
is collected by the customer at the time of utilization of the services provided by the CinemaxX Group.
Advertising revenue is realized in profit or loss, provided that the CinemaxX Group has rendered the
agreed advertising services.

In conjunction with the sale of vouchers, a portion of the cash receipts are recognized as revenues
independently of actual utilization based on statistical empirical data on attendance patterns relating to
the probability of redemption.

If customers are awarded prizes in conjunction with the sale of tickets which entitle the customer to free
purchase of other products, a portion of the revenues resulting from ticket sales will be attributed to the
prize vouchers under consideration of the probability of redemption based on statistical empirical data.
That portion of revenue is not collected as sales revenue until the customer redeems his prizes.

Movie rentals are billed weekly in arrears to film distributors. Operating expenses are recognized on the
date of utilization of the services or when they are incurred as expense. Interest income and interest
expenses are recognized in the period in which they occur.

Borrowing costs are recognized as current expenses as is appropriate. Interest for qualifying assets
within the meaning of IAS 23 is not capitalized, as such assets do not exist within the CinemaxX Group.

**2.** **Intangible assets**

Intangible assets acquired for a consideration are recognized at cost less amortization and impairments.
Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, except for goodwill, do not exist. If the value of the asset
decreases, impairment is recognized. Intangible assets are amortized over the following useful lives:

**Useful life** **Years**

The results from the sale of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are recognized in other
operating income and expenses.

In the financial year 2011, a reassessment of the useful lives of analog projectors was performed in the
context of the digitalization of cinema operations planned for 2012 and 2013. The expected remaining
useful lives were adjusted without taking corresponding residual values into account, as the generation
of significant proceeds on disposal of analog projectors could not be assumed. This change led to an
increase in depreciation in 2011 in the amount of KEUR 756.

**4.** **Leases**

CinemaxX AG and its subsidiaries rent and lease properties and equipment for the operation of cinemas.
Leases are accounted for in accordance with the requirements set forth in IAS 17. In this regard, it must
be differentiated between operating leases and financing leases depending on the party bearing the
significant risks and rewards of ownership. Where the lease is a finance lease, the lessee maintains
beneficial ownership and, thus, capitalizes the leased item. A series of lease agreements on cinema
properties and cinema equipment which satisfy these criteria are in place within the CinemaxX Group.
Therefore, these properties and inventories were capitalized for companies in the CinemaxX Group. At
the same time, finance lease payments were recognized as liabilities.

At the inception of the lease, the group recognized assets and liabilities at the same amount in the
balance sheet at the lower of the fair value of the asset at the inception of the lease and the present value
of the minimum lease payments. The depreciation methods and useful lives of the capitalized assets
correspond to comparable assets acquired in the CinemaxX Group. If the useful life of the asset exceeds
the term of the underlying lease agreement, the asset is depreciated over the lease term.

The resulting payment obligations are recognized as a liability under financial liabilities. The interest
portion of the lease payments is recognized in the income statement over the lease term.

If the criteria set forth in IAS 17 are no longer satisfied due to the amendment of lease agreements, the
affected assets and liabilities are derecognized at the time at which the lease amendment comes into
effect. The difference existing on this date between the carrying amount of the assets and lease liabilities
to be derecognized is recognized in the income statement in other operating income.

Amendments of lease arrangements that do not result in a different classification as per IAS 17, lead to
an adjustment of the liability and the asset in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.

For leases classified as operating leases, the payments to be made by the CinemaxX Group are
recognized straight-line and in connection with underlying key ratios as expenses as is appropriate.

**5.** **Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets held under finance**
**leases**

The CinemaxX Group reviews the intangible assets and property, plant and equipment to establish
whether impairments are necessary.

An impairment of intangible assets except for goodwill and property, plant and equipment and assets in
finance leases is recognized, if and to the extent that, due to certain events or developments, the
carrying amount of the assets no longer exceeds the proceeds expected from the sale of assets or the
discounted net cash flows from further usage. The cash flows are discounted at a cost of capital that is
based on peer group companies. If it is not possible to calculate the recoverable amount for individual
assets, the cash flows are determined for the next highest group of assets for which such cash flows can
be calculated.

Goodwill, for which an impairment test must be conducted at least annually, is, for the performance of
the impairment tests, allocated to the reporting units for which an allocation of the goodwill is also
performed in the internal reporting system of the group. These reporting units correspond to individual
cinemas and groups of cinemas. The cash flows of reporting units are discounted at a cost of capital that
is based on peer group companies. Impairment is recognized if the net present value of the cash flows is
less than the carrying amount of the intangible assets and property, plant and equipment as well as net
current assets of the reporting unit including the allocated goodwill.

The impairment test is performed at the end of the financial year. The post-tax interest rate used in the
financial year 2011 for the discounting of the cash flows of reporting units when calculating the value in
use was 10.75% (prior year: 10.75%). The net cash flow is calculated on the basis of forecasts in the
individual reporting units over a forecast horizon of five years. The relevant forecasts for attendance and
the development of ticket and concession revenue as well as film rentals, in particular, were used to
determine net cash flows. A growth discount of 0% (prior year: 0%) in the interest rate was assumed for
the subsequent period.

Reversals of impairments are recognized when the reason for the impairment no longer applies in
subsequent periods. The reversal may be recognized to a maximum to the amount that would have been
recognized without the impairment. There are no reversal of impairments on impaired goodwill.

**6.** **Financial instruments**

**Hybrid financial instruments**

In the financial year 2008, the company issued convertible bonds which granted holders the right to
convert these financial instruments into shares of CinemaxX AG.

The debt component was recognized at the present value of the future interest payments and
repayments based on the risk-adjusted interest rate of a matching maturity. Subsequently, the debt
component is assessed based on the effective interest rate method.

The equity component is calculated on the date of issue of the hybrid financial instrument as the
difference between the fair value of the hybrid financial instrument and the fair value of the debt
component and recognized in equity reserves in consolidated equity. There is no subsequent
revaluation of the equity component.

**Other financial instruments**

Other financial instruments (financial assets and liabilities) within the meaning of IAS 32 and IAS 39
comprise trade receivables, interests, liquid assets, current and non-current loans, trade payables as
well as certain other financial assets and liabilities based on contractual agreements.

Financial instruments are recognized at amortized cost or at fair value. For current receivables and
liabilities, amortized cost is generally equivalent to the nominal amount or the settlement amount. The
fair value is generally equivalent to the market value or quoted share price. If an active market does not
exist, the fair value can be determined using financial mathematical methods. Should a fair value
measurement not be possible, assets are measured at cost.

On each balance sheet date, it is reviewed to determine objective evidence exists that the financial asset
or group of financial assets is impaired.

Financial assets are classified within the CinemaxX Group as follows:

- loans and receivables

- available-for-sale financial assets

As per IAS 39, shares in investments are classified for valuation purposes in the category
‘‘available-for-sale financial assets’’. Available-for-sale financial assets are recognized at the balance
sheet date at fair value or, if this is cannot be determined or not reliably determined, at cost. As the fair
values of investments cannot be determined due to an absence of quoted share price or lack of
appropriate valuation methods, these shares are recognized at cost.

Impairments on receivables and other ordinary financial assets that are allocated to the category ‘‘loans
and receivables’’ are usually recognized using impairment accounts. Impairments are recognized if
objective evidence exists that the financial asset may be exposed to a risk of default. The amount of the
impairment is determined by historical values or individual estimates of risk.

The classification depends on the respective purpose for which the financial assets were acquired.
Management determines the classification of financial assets on initial recognition and reviews the
classification at each reporting date.

At initial recognition financial liabilities are recognized at their fair values under consideration of market
interest rates. The subsequent measurement is at amortized cost using the effective interest method. As
per IAS 17.25, interest accruing on finance lease liabilities is determined by the effective interest rate.

Financial assets are derecognized if either the rights to the cash flows that can be generated from the
assets have become voided or almost all of the risks are transferred to a third party in such manner that
the criteria for derecognition are fulfilled.

Financial liabilities are derecognized if contractual obligations have been settled, annulled or have
expired. Financial liabilities are derecognized when a change to significant conditions causes a
significant change to the cash flows associated with the repayment or return. A new financial liability is
recognized at the point at which the adjustment comes into force at fair value plus any directly
attributable transaction costs. Differences between the carrying amount of the derecognized liability are
recognized in the interest result in the income statement.

The fair values of the financial instruments are determined on the basis of corresponding market values
or valuations methods. The fair values of liquid assets and other current primary financial instruments
correspond to the carrying amounts recognized on the respective reporting dates.

The fair value of non-current financial assets or liabilities is determined based on the expected cash flows
using the reference interest rates valid at the balance sheet date.

**7.** **Income taxes**

Current taxes are recognized as an expense at the time of their occurrence in the amount of the sum due.

Deferred taxes are recognized on future tax consequences of temporary differences between tax bases
of assets and liabilities and their IFRS carrying amounts as for loss carryforwards. Deferred taxes are
measured based on regulations issued by the regulatory authorities at the end of the respective financial
year for the financial years in which the differences will be reversed or the loss carryforwards are likely to
be utilized. Deferred tax assets on temporary differences and loss carryforwards are only recognized to
the extent that it is sufficiently probably that they will be realized in the near future, either due to sufficient
taxable temporary differences or because it is probable that the companies recognizing tax loss
carryforwards will generate sufficient taxable profit against which the tax loss carryforwards can be
utilized.

Deferred taxes are recognized on temporary differences that result from the recognition of assets and
liabilities at fair value in the context of business combinations. Deferred taxes are only recognized on
temporary differences for goodwill if the goodwill can be deducted for tax purposes.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset if and to the extent that the deferred taxes relate to taxes
from income that are levied by the same tax authorities and the taxes can be offset against each other.

**8.** **Finished goods and trading stock**

Inventories largely consist of concession products. Concession products are recognized at the lower of
cost and net realizable value as of the balance sheet date.

**9.** **Provisions**

Provisions, as per IAS 37, cover all identifiable obligations towards third parties arising on past events,
the settlement of which is expected to result in an outflow of funds and a reliable estimate of the amount
of the obligation can be made.

As per IAS 37, provisions are recognized at the expected settlement amount. The present value of the
expected settlement amount of non-current provisions is determined on the basis of market interest
rates.

**10. Government Grants**

The CinemaxX Group received government grants for assets. Government grants are only recognized,
as per IAS 20, if there is reasonable assurance that the associated conditions will be met and the grants
awarded. Expense-related grants are recognized as income over the period in which the corresponding
expenses will be incurred in order to offset such expenses.

Furthermore, the FFA provides companies of the CinemaxX Group with interest-free loans that have a
maximum term of ten years.

These loans are recognized when granted at fair value and subsequently amortized using the effective
interest rate method.

**11. Assets and liabilities held for sale**

Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if the disposal of such an asset within the next
12 months is seen as highly probable.

Classification in accordance with IFRS 5, thus, only occurs when the asset is in a state ready for sale and
the preparations of the sale have been initiated. The asset must be measured in accordance with IFRS 5
at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less expected costs to sell.

Liabilities also to be transferred along with the disposal of certain assets must be presented under
liabilities associated with assets classified as held for sale as a separate item in the balance sheet.

**12. Use of assumptions and estimates**

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, assumptions and estimates have been used that
have impacted the presentation and amount of the recognized assets, liabilities, income, expenses and
contingent liabilities. These assumptions and estimates essentially refer to the assessment of
impairment of goodwill (KEUR 1,423), the group-wide determination of the useful lives for intangible
assets with a definable useful life and property, plant and equipment including the assets held under
finance leases (KEUR 81,662), the measurement of provisions (KEUR 3,994) und voucher liabilities
(KEUR 14,137) as well as their realizability of future tax benefits, in particular from the use of tax loss
carryforwards, that are recognized as deferred tax assets (KEUR 27,625).

In the case of voucher liabilities, it is currently assumed on the basis on statistical historical values that
there is an 85% probability of the issued vouchers being redeemed.

In classifying and capitalizing lease agreements to be evaluated some estimate parameters were
applied.

When capitalizing deferred taxes for loss carryforwards, the estimates made in the group business plan
for the period from 2012 to 2016 was used to assess its realizability. In individual cases, the actual values
may deviate from the assumptions and estimates made. Changes are recognized once better
knowledge is acquired.

All estimates and assessments are continuously re-evaluated and are based on historic experiences and
other factors including expectations regarding future events which seem reasonable under the existing
conditions.

The group makes estimates and assumptions that concern the future. Naturally, the resulting estimates
will seldom be exactly equivalent to subsequent actual circumstances.

**13. Contingent liabilities**

Contingent liabilities are potential obligations that result from past events and whose existence depends
on future events that are not controlled by the company as well as existing obligations that cannot be
recognized as liabilities, because either an outflow of resources is improbable or the amount of the
obligation cannot be estimated in a sufficiently reliable manner. Such contingent liabilities are disclosed
with their scope of liability prevailing on the balance sheet date.

**14. Adjustment of comparative information**

Cash at banks of KEUR 6,105, to which the CinemaxX Group does not have unlimited access, is
presented as non-current other financial assets. In the consolidated financial statements as at
December 31, 2010, this cash was presented as cash and cash equivalents, such that in the
consolidated financial statements as at December 31, 2011, an adjustment to comparative information
has been made that the cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2010, were reduced by KEUR 1,638
(January 1, 2010: KEUR 1,452) and non-current other financial assets were increased by KEUR 1,638
(January 1, 2010: KEUR 1,452).

The item ‘‘franchises and licenses’’ summarizes software, ticket software and concession software. The
additions result, among others, from the acquisition of licenses for workplace management (KEUR 67).

Goodwill resulted from the acquisition of the formerly independent reporting units Broadway Filmtheater
Betriebs Gesellschaft mbH (KEUR 790)—related to the cinema operation at Holi, Hamburg—and the
Berliner Filmtheater Knapp GmbH & Co. KG (KEUR 633)—related to the cinema operation at Potsdamer
Platz, Berlin—and is classified under the domestic segment. In order to perform the impairment test,
goodwill has been allocated to the individual reporting units (cash generating units) to which goodwill in
the internal control of the group is allocated. The allocation is performed for the recognized goodwill at
the level of individual cinemas or groups of cinemas.

Land, similar rights to land, and buildings relate to leasehold improvements of air-conditioning and
ventilation systems, sprinkler systems, stage and screen structures, elevators and projectors.

Other equipment, furniture and fixtures relate to specific cinema interior fittings that the CinemaxX Group
invested based on closed lease agreements. This largely relates to equipment for projection, foyer
digitalization, seating, concession equipment and other cinema equipment. The vast majority of this
equipment has been pledged as securities for guarantees granted.

The finance leases concerning cinema properties have a fixed agreed minimum term of lease of between
20 and 30 years. The CinemaxX Group has the right, at some locations, to extend the lease agreement
by five years under similar conditions. A majority of the leases provide for fixed and attendancedependent rents as well as price index adjustments.

In the case of four real estate lease agreements and six equipment lease agreements, the present value
of the minimum lease installments largely covers the costs incurred by the lessor (present value
criterion). The CinemaxX Group is therefore the beneficial owner of these assets. A useful life of the
cinema properties of 40 years and useful lives of equipment of between eight and 20 years was used for
assessing the present value criterion. Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter
of the useful life and remaining term of the underlying lease agreement.

**4.** **Other non-current assets**

Deferred charges and prepaid expenses presented as other non-current assets mainly include
cash classified as fixed-term deposits that serve as collateral for guarantees (KEUR 6,105, prior
year: KEUR 1,638).

Shares in associates presented with a carrying amount of KEUR 0 at December 31, 2011 (prior year:
KEUR 0), an unrealized loss equal to the share of negative equity of KEUR 3,456 (prior year: KEUR 3,456)
existed at December 31, 2011. Measurement of the company in accordance with the equity method was
suspended as the loss generated in the prior years exceeded equity and no compensation obligations
exist. Contingent liabilities exist as CinemaxX AG is liable for certain obligations of its associates, please
see I.4 ‘‘Contingent Liabilities’’.

Due to the sustainably negative earnings position foreseen for an investment, the CinemaxX Group
recognized an impairment totaling KEUR 399 (prior year: KEUR 399) on the carrying amount of this
investment.

A receivable arose on the sale of the interior fittings following the transfer of a cinema in 2003. The
settlement of this receivable is contingent on various conditions, the fulfillment of which can currently be
classified as insufficiently probable; thus, the receivable was impaired in 2003.

**8.** **Equity**

The development of the consolidated equity over the financial years 2011 and 2010 is shown in the
consolidated statement of changes in equity to which reference is made.

The fully subscribed and paid up **share capital of CinemaxX AG amounts to EUR 26,962,291.00 at**
December 31, 2011 (December 31, 2010: EUR 26,962,291.00), and is made up of 26,962,291 non-par
shares with a nominal value of EUR 1.00 each. All shares are bearer stock.

At the annual shareholders’ meeting on June 25, 2009, authorized share capital of EUR 11,900,000
was resolved. The entry of the amendment to the articles of association was made on July 16, 2009. As at
December 31, 2011, the authorized share capital still amounts to EUR 8,737,709 due to the increase in
share capital in 2010 using authorized share capital.

At the shareholders’ meeting held on November 30, 2006, it was resolved to issue convertible bonds and
create contingent capital. The convertible bonds are divided into 2,683,438 bearer partial debentures
with equal rights with a nominal value of EUR 1.00 each. The convertible bonds are issued against a
contribution in kind by transferring the respective receivables of the creditor due from CinemaxX
Cinema GmbH & Co. KG. Each one Euro receivable corresponds to a partial debenture in the amount of
Euro 1.00.

In order to implement the convertible bonds, a resolution was passed at the shareholders’ meeting held
on November 30, 2006, regarding contingent capital, which provides for a contingent increase in share

F-164


18JUN201312290849


-----

18JUN201312290849

capital of up to EUR 894,480.00 by issuing up to 894,480 no-par value shares (‘‘contingent capital
2006’’). The contingent capital increase is implemented only insofar as the creditors of the convertible
bonds exercise their conversion privilege. The shares participate in the profit from January 1 of the year
in which they are drawn after exercising the conversion privilege. The contingent capital used to service
the convertible bonds was entered in the commercial register of the Company on March 26, 2007.

The bearers of debentures have the right to receive one share for each nominal EUR 3.00 of the
debenture (conversion ratio). An adjustment of the conversion rate will occur if the shares of the
company exceed an average value of EUR 3.00 in the three months prior to the beginning of the term.

By agreement dated February 15 and March 14, 2008, respectively, the Company agreed with a lessor to
transfer deferred rental obligations converted into a loan due to CinemaxX Cinema GmbH & Co. KG in
the amount of KEUR 2,683 to CinemaxX AG in return for the issue of convertible bonds in the amount of
nominally KEUR 2,683. The convertible bonds will accrue interest at 0.5% p.a. and confer on holders of
bonds the right to request, on a one-time basis on September 30, 2013, the repayment of the nominal
amount of KEUR 2,683 plus a premium of 12.5%.

The difference between the fair value of the convertible bond and the fair value of the liability without
consideration of the right to conversion resulted in an allocation of KEUR 1,016 to capital reserves in
2008 on their issue. The fair value of the liability without consideration of conversion rights on issue of
KEUR 1,667 was recognized under loans and compounded to September 30, 2013, using the effective
interest rate method and an interest rate of 12.0% p.a.

**Capital reserves of KEUR 8,291 are blocked from distribution in accordance with commercial law and**
stock corporation law provisions.

**9.** **Goodwill offset with equity reserves in prior years**

Goodwill, which arose on the initial consolidation of five subsidiaries in accordance with the provisions of
German commercial law in the period 1997 to 2001, was offset with equity reserves in accordance with
the German accounting regulations applied at the time of initial consolidation in the amount of KEUR
62,670 recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.

In adopting IFRS for financial reporting, CinemaxX AG exercised the option set forth in IFRS 1, whereby a
retroactive application of IFRS 3 to business combinations that occurred prior to the reporting date of the
IFRS opening balance sheet (January 1, 2004) may be waived. The offsetting of the goodwill was
therefore retained for the above-mentioned five companies.

**10. Minority interests**

Non-controlling interests relate to the shares of other shareholders in the equity and the earnings derived
from CinemaxX Filmtheater GmbH, Hamburg, and CinemaxX Danmark A/S, Copenhagen.

On February 18, 2011, 3% of shares of CinemaxX Danmark A/S were disposed of for a price of KEUR 83.
The disposal resulted in an increase of KEUR 115 in adjustment items from shareholder transactions.

**14. Interest-bearing loans**

The bank loan taken out in the reporting year of KEUR 10,000 with an interest rate of 5.9% p.a. and a
term to December 30, 2015, will be repaid in quarterly installments of KEUR 588. The loan was valued at
KEUR 9,412 at the balance sheet date.

The interest rate is fixed until December 30, 2013. If no new interest rate conditions are agreed by then,
the remainder of the loan will fall due in one repayment on December 30, 2013. Dividends are restricted
depending on the group equity ratio. On reduction of the shares of the majority shareholder to below
50.1% or full disposal of his participation (change of control) during the term of the loan, the bank has an
immediate right to termination and full repayment.

The installment purchase contract for cinema equipment, which has a remaining term of 42 months and
a monthly repayment of KEUR 29, has a carrying value of KEUR 1,079 (prior year: KEUR 1,353) at
December 31, 2011.

In addition, interest-free loans have been provided by the German Federal Film Board

[Filmf¨orderungsanstalt] Berlin which are discounted to present value at a discount rate of 6%.

**15. Provisions**

**Accumulated** **31 DEC**

**Total . . . . . . . . . . .** **4,347** **680** **49** **176** **200** **3,994**

The provisions essentially relate to provisions for onerous contracts from subleases and an obligatory
contribution that relates to a net obligation associated with an investment. In measuring the provisions
from the obligatory contribution, which the CinemaxX Group has in the amount of KEUR 33 monthly until
2020, estimates regarding the probability of an agreement before the expiry of the obligation and
possible compensation payments were taken into consideration.

**16. Other current liabilities**

**10. Income tax**

Income tax includes all tax liabilities in individual countries or tax burdens arising on income, as well as
deferred taxes. Income tax includes, thereby, trade tax, corporation tax, a solidarity surcharge, and any
relevant international income tax.

For German companies subject to corporation tax, a corporation tax rate of 15.0% as well as the
solidarity surcharge of 5.5% on the corporation tax applies. Additionally, these companies as well as
domestic companies in the legal form of partnership are subject to trade earnings tax, the amount of
which is determined by the specific applicable municipal assessment rate. For corporations trade tax no
longer reduces the basis of assessment for corporation tax.

Tax income (+)/expense(–) arising on income tax is classified by origin as follows:

**In KEUR** **2011** **2010**

The notional expense for income taxes that would have resulted with the application of the tax rate of the
parent company CinemaxX AG of 32.28% (prior year: 32.28%) to the IFRS consolidated income before

**Income tax as per the income statement (income) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** �5,552 **10,581**

The deferred taxes are determined based on tax rates that apply under current law in Germany and are
expected at the time of realization. A tax rate of 32.28%, which consists of the corporation tax rate of
15.0%, the solidarity surcharge of 5.5% and the trade tax rate of 16.45% applicable in Hamburg, was
used for the calculation both in 2010 and 2011. Companies in the legal form of a partnership are subject
to trade tax. The trade tax no longer reduces their own basis of assessment and, in the case of
corporations, no longer reduces the basis of assessment for corporation tax. On the basis of the
minimum taxation rate, the tax loss carryforwards in Germany can only be used to a limited degree. This
requires an unlimited positive tax basis of assessment of up to EUR 1 million, additional amounts of a
maximum of 60% must be reduced by an existing loss carryforward.

The effects of different tax rates for partnerships and for domestic and international taxes on the parent
company’s tax rate are recognized in the reconciliation as varying tax rates.

The trade tax additions and reductions largely result from the addition of interest and rents for the use of
external moveable and immovable operational assets.

The tax effects of corrections made to the recognition of deferred tax result from the recognition of
deferred tax assets on tax loss carryforwards and deductible temporary differences that were not
previously recognized, on the basis of an updated tax forecast for the coming financial years.

Deferred tax assets are recognized on temporary differences and tax loss carry-forwards if their
realization seems certain in the near future. Deferred taxes on loss carryforwards are capitalized to the
extent that the group has sufficient taxable temporary differences or where it is probable that the affected
companies will achieve sufficient taxable results over the course of subsequent years against which the
tax loss carryforwards may be offset.

At December 31, 2011, the Group has corporation tax loss carryforwards of KEUR 122,817 (prior year:
KEUR 144,517) and trade tax loss carryforwards of KEUR 42,705 (prior year: KEUR 59,245) available and
not limited to a certain time period.

As of December 31, 2011 deferred tax assets were not recognized on tax loss carryforwards for
corporation tax purposes in the amount of KEUR 8,297 (prior year: KEUR 7,709) and for trade tax
purposes in the amount of KEUR 6,379 (prior year: KEUR 6,286), as their realization does not appear
sufficiently probable over the coming years. Current tax law allows tax losses and interest relief to be
carried forward indefinitely.

**11. Earnings per Share**

In order to determine the earnings per share according to IAS 33, the consolidated income attributable to
the shareholders is divided by the weighted average of the shares. The number of shares in the financial
year 2011 amounted to 26,962,291.

The convertible bonds issued in 2008 are classified as potentially diluting shares due to the right to
conversion. On exercise of conversion rights, this could lead to an issuance of 894,480 shares.

liabilities that are recognized in other operating income.

**2.** **Financial risk management**

**_Market risks_**

_a)_ _Foreign exchange risk_

In the course of its business activities, the CinemaxX Group is only to an insignificant extent subject to
foreign exchange risks, as the transactions were almost exclusively made in the functional currency of
the affiliates. Only marginal foreign exchange risks exist in terms of the exchange rate between the
Danish krone and the euro.

F-176


18JUN201312290849


-----

18JUN201312290849

Due to the insignificant role of the foreign exchange risk, it was decided not to conduct a sensitivity
analysis.

_b)_ _Interest rate risk_

The interest rate risk relates to the sensitivity of financial assets and liabilities in connection with changes
to the market interest rate. The CinemaxX Group generally pursues a security-oriented financing policy
where long-term fixed rate arrangements, if available, are usually made for the group. In the financial
year financing was largely carried out by means of interest-bearing loans from banks, prepayments by
advertising customers and advertising administrators as well as from other operating cash flow. To the
extent that the CinemaxX Group enters into interest rate risks in the course of financing, these are not
hedged. No derivative financial instruments for interest hedging exist as at the balance sheet date.

As the group only had outstanding fixed interest-bearing obligations at the cut-off date, a sensitivity
analysis is not performed.

_c)_ _Default risk_

Due to operating activities, significant revenue is effected by means of cash deposits. Here the risk of
default is limited to monetary transactions that are covered by taking out insurance policies. Significant
receivables are created throughout the year against advertisers. To this end, the business model
provided for prepayments by advertisers until the end of 2010 which are balanced by offsetting against
services performed throughout the year. Therefore, there was no default risk. The CinemaxX Group
achieved a significant improvement in the revenue situation through the takeover of the marketing for all
own media by a new department. However, this is contrasted with a higher liquidity risk, as large parts of
the marketing revenue were guaranteed by advertising agents the in the past.

Individual impairments amount to KEUR 990 (prior year: KEUR 1,142). This essentially relates to a
receivable derived from the sale of equipment against a cinema operator who had taken over the
business operations of a CinemaxX cinema. The probable default risk is recognized by the values shown
in the balance sheet. If the counterparty defaults, a maximum risk of default in the amount of the
respective carrying amount consists of trade receivables (carrying amount KEUR 8,402) and other
financial assets (carrying amount KEUR 2,343).

The impairments on trade receivables developed as follows:

**In KEUR** **2011** **2010**

**(Expressed in PLN, all amounts in thousands, except as otherwise stated)**

**1.** **GENERAL INFORMATION**

Multikino S.A. (‘‘the Company’’, ‘‘Multikino’’ or ‘‘the Parent’’) and its subsidiaries (‘‘the Group’’), operate
a network of multi-screen cinemas and act as a film distributor in Poland. The Group is part of the
ITI Group, a group of companies controlled by International Trading and Investments Holdings S.A.
Luxembourg (‘‘ITI Holdings’’) which owns 86% of the Company’s shares as at the balance sheet date.
The remaining 14% is owned by A.P. Portico Slask S.a.r.l. (‘A.P. Portico Slask’). ITI Holdings is ultimately,
jointly controlled by the members of the Wejchert, Walter, Valsangiacomo and Kostrzewa families.
ITI Group has been active in Poland since 1984 and is one of the largest media and entertainment
groups in Poland.

On 10 May 2013 an agreement for the sale of the whole of the issued share capital of the Company by
the owners of the Company and Vue Holdings Limited Group was signed, with certain conditions
precedent, including the Office of Competition and Consumer Protection concentration approval. At the
date of the authorisation of these special purpose interim condensed consolidated financial statements
for issue the conditions precedent have not been met.

The address of its registered office is Mokotowska 49, Warsaw. These interim condensed consolidated
financial statements for the three month period ended 31 March 2013 are special purpose financial
statements and have been prepared for the purpose of inclusion in the offering document of Vougeot
Bidco p.l.c. These interim condensed consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the
Management Board on 1 July 2013.

These special purpose interim condensed consolidated financial statements include the financial
information of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries for the three month period from 1 January do
31 March 2013. The financial year of the Company and its Polish domiciled subsidiaries that has begun
on 1 January 2011 has been extended up until 30 September 2012 and the financial year that begun on
1 October 2012 has been extended up until 30 June 2014. The financial year of subsidiaries domiciled in
Latvia and Lithuania ends on 31 December 2013. The Group does not prepare statutory consolidated
financial statements based on IAS 27.10.

There was no change in the structure of the Group in the period covered by these interim condensed
consolidated financial statements.

**2.** **ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these interim condensed consolidated
financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years
presented, unless otherwise stated.

2.1 Basis of preparation

These interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
International Accounting Standard IAS 34 ‘Interim financial reporting’ as adopted by the European Union
(‘EU’).

The interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost
convention. As at 31 March 2013 current liabilities exceed current assets by 71.893 (31 December 2012:
71.187). The Management considers the risk of potential liquidity problems as low and believes that
there are no indicators which could lead to the conclusion that the going concern assumption is
inappropriate. Further information about liquidity risk management is provided in Note 3.

These special purpose interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the special purpose consolidated financial statements for the twelve month period
ended 31 December 2012.

The accounting policies used in the preparation of the interim condensed consolidated financial
statements as of and for the three months ended 31 March 2013 are consistent with those used in the

**Multikino Group**

**Special Purpose Interim Condensed Consolidated financial statements**

**for the three month period ended 31 March 2013**

**(Expressed in PLN, all amounts in thousands, except as otherwise stated)**

**2.** **ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

special purpose consolidated financial statements for the twelve month period ended 31 December
2012, except for new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations being effective for the
reporting periods beginning on 1 January 2013.

Taxes on income in the interim periods are accrued using the effective tax rate.

Following new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations being effective for the
reporting periods beginning on 1 January 2013 were applicable for Group’s activities:

- _Amendment to IAS 1, ‘Financial statement presentation’ regarding other comprehensive income._

The main change resulting from these amendments is a requirement for entities to group items
presented in ‘other comprehensive income’ (OCI) on the basis of whether they are potentially
reclassifiable to profit or loss subsequently (reclassification adjustments). The amendments do not
address which items are presented in OCI. The Group has only foreign exchange differences on the
translation of the foreign subsidriaries. These items are reclassifiable to profit/loss. The
amendement was reflected in the presentation of the Statement of Other Comprehensive Income.

The other new or amended standards effective for the reporting periods beginning on 1 January 2013 do
not have impact on these interim condensed consolidated financial statements.

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain
critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of
applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or
complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial
statements are disclosed in Note 4.

**3.** **FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT**

The Group’s overall risk management program aimed at minimising potential adverse effects of financial
risks on Group’s financial performance is consistent with the policies described in the special purpose
consolidated financial statements for the twelve month period ended 31 December 2012.

Liquidity and financing risk

Compared to the year end there was no change in the liquidity and financing risk management position.

The Group plans to finance its operations, including capital expenditure and investments, through a
combination of cash generated from operations, sale and leaseback collateralised borrowing and
finance lease transactions involving newly acquired property, plant and equipment, issuance of bonds
and the existing overdraft facilities.

Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity reserve (which comprises cash and cash
equivalents) on the basis of expected cash flow. As at 31 March 2013 current liabilities exceed current
assets by 71.893 (31 December 2012: 71.187). The positive operating cash flows generated in the past
and forecasted positive operating cash flows are estimated to cover the repayment of Group’s current
liabilities.

(31 December 2012: 2.836) and statutory liabilities of 1.584 (31 December 2012: 3.264).

**4.** **CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENT**

Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other
factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances.

The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting
estimates will, by definition, rarely equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
within the next financial year are outlined below.

Estimated impairment

Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is
recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The
recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the
purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the level of cash generating units (operating
segments level, which is equivalent to the reporting segment). Non-financial assets other than goodwill
that suffered impairment in prior periods are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each
reporting date.

If indications exist that the assets grouped in the individual cash generating units (cinemas) are
impaired, the Group reviews the given cinema for impairment (see Note 8). The goodwill is tested for
impairment in the interim period if the impairment indicators are identified. The level at which goodwill is
tested for impairment is an operating segment ‘Cinema operations—Poland’.

Revenue generation, especially in the Cinemas segment, is driven by attendance, as well as average
ticket price and snacks and drinks revenue per head. Attendance is driven by popularity of films shown
and the line-up of the films that attract the widest audience. The Group’s operations are not seasonal.

**Special Purpose Interim Condensed Consolidated financial statements**

**for the three month period ended 31 March 2013**

**(Expressed in PLN, all amounts in thousands, except as otherwise stated)**

**6.** **PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (CONTINUED)**

Depreciation expense of 7.107 (2012: 7.819) has been charged in cost of sales and 164 (2012: 164) has
been charged in administrative expenses.

Lease rentals amounting to 13.210 (2012: 12.652) relating to the lease of land and premises are included
in the consolidated income statements (Note 15). Minimum lease payments for non—cancellable leases
are presented in Note 21.

**7.** **OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS**

The Group has no internally generated intangible assets.

Amortisation of 225 (2012: 179) has been charged in cost of sales and 547 (2012: 93) has been charged
to administrative expenses.

**8.** **IMPAIRMENT OF NON-CURRENT ASSETS**

As at 31 December 2012, the impairment test of goodwill was carried out based on the value in use and
showed that there was no impairment (details are disclosed in the special purpose consolidated
financial statements for the twelve months ended 31 December 2012).

On 10 May 2013, following the negotiations commenced before 31 March 2013 the owners of the
Company singed an agreement for the sale of the whole of the issued share capital of the Company. The
completion of the agreement is subject to conditions precedent, including antimonopoly approval. The
agreed sales price is lower than the net assets of the Multikino Group, which in Management’s view, is an
impairment indicator as at 31 March 2013 as the agreed sales price is the best evidence of the value of
the Group. Thus it has triggered an impairment test as at 31 March 2013 with the recoverable amount
being fair value less cost to sell (i.e. the agreed purchase consideration).

As the result of this impairment test, the goodwill was fully impaired (78.958) and the remaining amount
of impairment loss in an amount of 31.985 was allocated pro rata to the other assets. In accordance with
requirements of IAS 36 individual assets were not written below their fair value if it was determinable. In
total the impairment loss of 110.943 was recognised (78.958 relating to goodwill as administrative
expenses and 31,985 relating to the tangible fixed assets as cost of sales).

As at 31 March 2012, Management has determined that:

- in connection with the decision to abandon two projects an impairment loss of 1.057 has been
charged to the interim condensed consolidated income statement in the three month period ended
31 March 2012 and reduced the value of property, plant and equipment (see Note 6);

- no impairment indicators were identified for any of the remaining cash generating units.

**Independent auditor’s report**

To the Management Board of Multikino S.A.

_Report on the special purpose consolidated financial statements_

We have audited the accompanying special purpose consolidated financial statements of Multikino S.A.
and its subsidiaries (the ‘Multikino Group’), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at
31 December 2012 and the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive
income, consolidated statement of changes in shareholder’s equity and consolidated cash flows
statement for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other
explanatory information.

_Management’s responsibility for the special purpose consolidated financial statements_

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these special purpose
consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as
adopted by the European Union and for such internal control as management determines is necessary
to enable the preparation of the special purpose consolidated financial statements that are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

_Auditor’s responsibility_

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these special purpose consolidated financial statements
based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing.
Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material
misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or
error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s
preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting
policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our audit opinion.

_Opinion_

In our opinion, the special purpose consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects the financial position of the Multikino Group as at 31 December 2012, and its financial
performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.

**Multikino Group**

**Special Purpose Consolidated financial statements**

**for the twelve month period ended 31 December 2012**

**(Expressed in PLN, all amounts in thousands, except as otherwise stated)**

**1.** **GENERAL INFORMATION**

Multikino S.A. (‘‘the Company’’, ‘‘Multikino’’ or ‘‘the Parent’’) and its subsidiaries (‘‘the Group’’), operate
a network of multi-screen cinemas and act as a film distributor in Poland. The Group is part of the
ITI Group, a group of companies controlled by International Trading and Investments Holdings S.A.
Luxembourg (‘‘ITI Holdings’’) which owns 86% of the Company’s shares as at the balance sheet date.
The remaining 14% is owned by A.P. Portico Slask S.a.r.l. (‘‘A.P. Portico Slask’’). ITI Holdings is ultimately,
jointly controlled by the members of the Wejchert, Walter, Valsangiacomo and Kostrzewa families.
ITI Group has been active in Poland since 1984 and is one of the largest media and entertainment
groups in Poland.

The Company is a joint stock company incorporated on 8 July 1998 and domiciled in Poland. The
address of its registered office is Mokotowska 49, Warsaw. On 10 July 2007 the Company was subject to
a transition from a limited liability (Multikino Sp. z o.o.) to a joint stock company (Multikino S.A.).

These consolidated financial statements for the twelve month period ended 31 December 2012 are
special purpose financial statements and have been prepared for the purpose of inclusion in the offering
document of Vougeot Bidco p.l.c. These consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by
the Management Board on 1 July 2013.

The special purpose consolidated financial statements for the same period from 1 January 2012 to
31 December 2012 were prepared in Polish to fulfil the Group’s reporting requirements arising from the
agreements with financing parties and authorised for the issue on 28 February 2013. There are no
differences with respect to reported net profit or equity between these two sets of the financial
statements. Additional post balance sheet event disclosure was provided in Note 30 for events which
occurred between the date of the authorisation for the issue of the previous and current version of the
financial statements.

These special purpose consolidated financial statements for the twelve month period ended
31 December 2012 include the financial information of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries for the
period from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2012 (see Note 29). The financial year of the Company and
its Polish domiciled subsidiaries that has begun on 1 January 2011 has been extended up until
30 September 2012 and the financial year that begun on 1 October 2012 has been extended up until
30 June 2014. The financial year of subsidiaries domiciled in Latvia and Lithuania ends on 31 December
2012.

These special purpose consolidated financial statements are not statutory finanacial statements. The
Group does not prepare statutory consolidated financial statements based on IAS 27.10.

**2.** **ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these special purpose consolidated
financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years
presented, unless otherwise stated.

2.1. Basis of preparation

The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union. In view of the current
process of IFRS endorsement in the European Union certain IFRS and Interpretations of International
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (‘IFRIC’) have not yet been endorsed by the EU, however
as at the date of authorisation of these consolidated financial statements, there is no difference as
regards the Group between IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standard Board (‘‘IASB’’)
and IFRS as adopted by the EU.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. As at
31 December 2012 current liabilities exceed current assets by 71.187 (2011: 65.316). The Management

**Special Purpose Consolidated financial statements**

**for the twelve month period ended 31 December 2012**

**(Expressed in PLN, all amounts in thousands, except as otherwise stated)**

**2.** **ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

considers the risk of potential liquidity problems as low and believes that there are no indicators which
could lead to the conclusion that the going concern assumption is inappropriate. Further information
about liquidity and financial risk management is provided in Note 3.

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain
critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of
applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or
complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial
statements are disclosed in Note 4.

2.1.1. Accounting standards and IFRIC interpretations that were adopted by the Group

In the year beginning on 1 January 2012 the Group adopted:

_(i)_ _Amendments to IFRS 7 Disclosures—Transfers of Financial Assets_

The amendments amend the required disclosures related to transfers of financial assets. The
amendments did not affect the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

_(ii)_ _Amendments to IFRS 1 Severe Hyperinflation and Removal of Fixed Dates for First-time Adopters_

The amendments did not affect the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

_(iii) Amendments to IAS 12 Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets_

The amendments relate to measuring deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets relating to
investment property measured using the fair value model in IAS 40 Investment Property and introduce a
rebuttable presumption that an investment property is recovered entirely through sale. This presumption
is rebutted if the investment property is held within a business model whose objective is to consume
substantially all of the economic benefits embodied in the investment property over time, rather than
through sale. SIC 21 Income Taxes—Recovery of Revalued Non-Depreciable Assets which addresses
similar issues involving non-depreciable assets measured using the revaluation model in IAS 16
Property, Plant and Equipment was incorporated into IAS 12 after excluding guidance regarding
investment property measured at fair value.

These amendments did not affect the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

2.1.2. Accounting standards and IFRIC interpretations issued but not yet effective and not early
adopted by the Group

A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for following
reporting periods beginning after 1 January 2012, and have not been early applied in preparing these
consolidated financial statements. None of these is expected to have a significant effect on the
consolidated financial statements of the Group, except the following set out below:

_(i)_ _Amendment to IAS 1, ‘Financial statement presentation’ regarding other comprehensive income._

The main change resulting from these amendments is a requirement for entities to group items
presented in ‘other comprehensive income’ (OCI) on the basis of whether they are potentially
reclassifiable to profit or loss subsequently (reclassification adjustments). The amendments do not
address which items are presented in OCI. The Group has only items which are reclassifiable to profit/
loss.

**(Expressed in PLN, all amounts in thousands, except as otherwise stated)**

**2.** **ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

_(ii)_ _IFRS 13, ‘Fair value measurement’_

The standard aims to improve consistency and reduce complexity by providing a precise definition of fair
value and a single source of fair value measurement and disclosure requirements for use across IFRSs.
The requirements, which are largely aligned between IFRSs and US GAAP, do not extend the use of fair
value accounting but provide guidance on how it should be applied where its use is already required or
permitted by other standards within IFRSs or US GAAP. The Group is currently assessing the impact of
this standard.

_(iii) IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’_

The standard addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and
financial liabilities. IFRS 9 was issued in November 2009 and October 2010. It replaces the parts of
IAS 39 that relate to the classification and measurement of financial instruments. IFRS 9 requires
financial assets to be classified into two measurement categories: those measured as at fair value and
those measured at amortised cost. The determination is made at initial recognition. The classification
depends on the entity’s business model for managing its financial instruments and the contractual cash
flow characteristics of the instrument. For financial liabilities, the standard retains most of the IAS 39
requirements. The main change is that, in cases where the fair value option is taken for financial
liabilities, the part of a fair value change due to an entity’s own credit risk is recorded in other
comprehensive income rather than the income statement, unless this creates an accounting mismatch.
The Group is yet to assess IFRS 9’s full impact and intends to adopt IFRS 9 no later than the accounting
period beginning on or after 1 January 2015. The Group will also consider the impact of the remaining
phases of IFRS 9 when completed by the Board. This standard was not yet adopted by the EU.

_(iv) IFRS 10, ‘Consolidated financial statements’._

The standard builds on existing principles by identifying the concept of control as the determining factor
in whether an entity should be included within the consolidated financial statements of the parent
company. The standard provides additional guidance to assist in the determination of control where this
is difficult to assess. The Group is yet to assess IFRS 10’s full impact and intends to adopt IFRS 10 no
later than the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2014.

_(v)_ _IFRS 12, ‘Disclosures of interests in other entities’._

The standard includes the disclosure requirements for all forms of interests in other entities, including
joint arrangements, associates, special purpose vehicles and other off balance sheet vehicles. The
Group is yet to assess IFRS 12’s full impact and intends to adopt IFRS 12 no later than the accounting
period beginning on or after 1 January 2014.

There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to
have a material impact on the Group.

2.2. Consolidation

_Subsidiaries_

(a) General

Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) over which the Group has the power to
govern the financial and operating policies, generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one
half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable
or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries

**Special Purpose Consolidated financial statements**

**(Expressed in PLN, all amounts in thousands, except as otherwise stated)**

**2.** **ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are
de-consolidated from the date that the control ceases.

Revenues and costs, intra-group balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group
companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless they are considered an
impairment indicator of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed
where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

The transactions with non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with equity owners of
the Group. For purchases of shares from non-controlling interests, the difference between any
consideration and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of the net assets of the subsidiary is
recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.

The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries. The
consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the
liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes
the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement.

Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and
contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the
acquisition date.

On an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, the Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the
acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s net
assets.

The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree
and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the
identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If this is less than the fair value of the net assets
of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the
consolidated income statement.

(b) Business combinations involving entities or businesses under common control.

As business combinations involving entities under common control are excluded from the scope of
IFRS 3 Business combinations, the accounting policy in this area has to be chosen by Management, and
would then be applied consistently for all business combination transactions relating to entities under
common control. The Group uses the predecessor value method.

This method assumes the application of the following rules:

- The business combination under common control is accounted for in the period when such
combination takes place. The information for periods prior to the combination is re-presented as if
the combining entities were together from the date they became controlled by the ultimate
controlling entity.

- The values used to record the combining business assets (including goodwill) and liabilities in the
Group’s consolidated financial statements are equal to the value of assets (including goodwill) and
liabilities of the combining business which were presented in the consolidated financial statements
of the ultimate controlling entity. No new goodwill is recorded as a result of business combinations
with entities under common control. The value of net assets of the combining entity at the date when
the combining entity became controlled by the entity that has common control is credited to a
merger reserve net of any consideration paid to acquire a business.

2.3. Segment reporting

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to
Management of the Parent, as a decision-making body responsible for allocating resources and
assessing performance of the operating segments.

Segment information is presented in Note 5.

2.4. Foreign currency

(a) Functional and presentation currency

Items included in the Group’s consolidated financial statements are measured using the currency of the
primary economic environment in which the Group’s entities operate (‘‘the functional currency’’). The
accompanying consolidated financial statements are presented in Polish Zloty (‘‘PLN’’, ‘‘zloty’’), which is
the Company’s presentation and functional currency.

(b) Transactions and balances

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange
applicable at the balance sheet date. Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional
currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Gains and losses arising
from the settlement of such transactions and from translation of monetary assets and liabilities at
year-end exchange rates are recognised in the consolidated income statement.

(c) Translation of the foreign operations

The results and financial positions of all the Group entities (none of which has the currency of the hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency of this
consolidated financial statements are translated into the presentation currency as follows:

- Assets and liabilities of each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of
the balance sheet,

- Income and expense for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates (unless
this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the
transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the
transactions), and

- All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.

**2.** **ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

2.6. Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less depreciation. Where the carrying amount
of an asset is greater than its estimated recoverable amount (the higher of fair value less costs to sell and
its value in use), it is written down immediately to its recoverable amount.

Subsequent expenditure relating to an item of property, plant and equipment is added to the carrying
amount of the asset when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to
the entity and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repair and maintenance expenses
are charged to the consolidated income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.

Borrowing costs incurred for the construction of any qualifying assets are capitalised during the period
of time that is required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use.

In respect of general borrowing costs relating to qualifying assets, the Group capitalises borrowing costs
incurred in the period of the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset as part of the
cost of that asset using a capitalisation rate.

The Group defines qualifying assets as assets that take at least 7 months to get ready for their intended
use.

Depreciation of property, plant and equipment begins when the asset is available for use i.e. when it is in
the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by the
Management. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment ceases at the earlier of when the asset is
classified as held for sale or when the asset is derecognised.

Depreciation of assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost to their residual
values over the assets estimated useful lives as follows:

Buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10–40 years
Cinemas’ machinery and equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4–15 years
Vehicles . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 years

Improvements to leased premises and buildings are depreciated over the shorter of their useful life or the
related lease term, unless there is a reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership of the
leased asset by the end of the lease term. Land and assets under construction are not depreciated.

Residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and
are recognised within other gains/(losses), net in the consolidated income statement.

2.7. Intangible assets

(a) Goodwill

Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include
the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units
for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those cash-generating units or groups of
cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the syngergies of the business combination in
which the goodwill arose (see Note 2.9 and Note 4).

(b) Brands

Brands are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives.

**2.** **ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

(c) Computer software

Acquired computer software licenses are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and
bring to use the specific software. Acquired computer software is amortised using the straight-line
method over 5 years.

2.8. Right to the perpetual usufruct of land

Initial payments to acquire right to the perpetual usufruct of land are stated at historical cost (being the
purchase consideration) less amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method
over the assets useful life, i.e. 99 years.

2.9. Impairment of non-financial assets

Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is
recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The
recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s (or cash generating units) fair value less costs to sell and
value in use.

The Group performs impairment test in relation to goodwill on annual basis and whenever indications
exist that goodwill may be impaired.

When indications exist that some of the Group’s assets may be impaired, the Groups initially performs an
impairment test in relation to the cash generating unit (typically a single cinema location) where this
indication exists and recognises the potential impairment and then performs an impairment test in
relation to the operating segment to which this cash generating unit belongs, if goodwill had been
allocated to this operating segment.

For the purpose of assessing impairment of goodwill on annual basis and should no indications for
impairment of assets exist, an impairment test of goodwill is performed in relation to the group of cash
generating units equivalent to the operating segment where goodwill had been allocated.

Non-financial assets (except for goodwill) that suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal
of the impairment at each reporting date.

2.10. Financial assets

The Group classifies its financial assets into financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and
receivables, available-for-sale financial assets and held-to-maturity financial assets. The classification
depends on the purpose for which the financial assets are acquired. The Management of the Group
determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and re-evaluates the designation
at every reporting date. As at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011 the Group has only the financial
assets classified to the category ‘‘loans and receivable’’ (these assets are receivables, cash and cash
equivalents and restricted cash).

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are
not quoted in an active market. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than
12 months after the balance sheet date. These are classified as non-current assets.

Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired or
have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.

**for the twelve month period ended 31 December 2012**

**(Expressed in PLN, all amounts in thousands, except as otherwise stated)**

**2.** **ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial
asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. Loans and receivables are tested for impairment the
same way as trade receivables. Impairment testing of trade receivables is described in Note 2.12.

2.11. Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the first-in,
first-out (FIFO) method. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of
business, less applicable variable selling expenses.

Spare parts used in rendering Group’s services that do not meet definition of the property, plant and
equipment are classified as ‘inventory’’.

2.12. Trade receivables

Trade receivables are carried initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using
the effective interest rate method less provision made for impairment of these receivables. A provision for
impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be
able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of settlement. Significant financial
difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and
default or delinquency in payments (more than 90 days overdue) are considered indicators that the trade
receivable is impaired. The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying
amount and the recoverable amount, calculated as the present value of expected future cash flows using
the original effective interest rate. The amount of the provision is recognised in the consolidated income
statement. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and
the amount of the loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement within selling expenses.
When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account for trade
receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against selling
expenses in the consolidated income statement.

2.13. Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, and other short term
highly liquid investments with original maturity of less than three months.

2.14. Share capital

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares
that otherwise would have been avoided are shown in equity as a deduction (net of any related income
tax benefit) from the proceeds.

2.15. Share premium

The share premium represents the fair value of amounts paid to the Company by shareholders above
the nominal value of shares issued to them.

2.16. Merger reserve

In case of a business combination under common control, the difference between the consideration
transferred and the value of net assets of the combining entity is recognised as merger reserve (for
details of this method, please refer to Note 2.2 (d)).

2.17. Trade payables

Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using
the effective interest method.

2.18. Borrowings

The Group recognises its borrowings initially at fair value net of transaction costs incurred. In
subsequent periods, borrowings are stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net
of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the consolidated income statement over
the period of instruments using the effective interest method.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer
settlement of a liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.

Borrowing costs incurred for the construction of any qualifying assets are capitalised during the period
of time that is required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use. Other costs relating to
borrowings are expensed.

2.19. Current and deferred income tax

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively
enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the company’s subsidiaries operate and
generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect
to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation and establishes provisions
where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.

Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial
statements. However deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an
asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction
affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.

Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and regulations that have been enacted by the
balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or
the deferred income tax liability is settled.

Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be
available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences arising on
investments in subsidiaries except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is
controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the
foreseeable future or the asset cannot be utilised.

As these are special purpose financial statements, they include periods which are different for tax and
the accounting purposes, therfore the tax for such accounting periods was calculated using the effective
tax rate.

2.20. Employee benefits (pension obligations)—post employment defined contribution plan

The Group pays contributions to publicly administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory basis.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions
are recognised as employee benefit expense in the period to which they relate.

2.21. Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of
past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the
amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.

Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the
obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and
the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as
interest expense.

2.22. Revenue recognition

Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and
services in the ordinary course of the Group’s activities. Revenue is shown net of value-added tax,
returns, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group.

The Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that
future economic benefits will flow to the entity and specific criteria have been met for each of the Group’s
activities as described below.

The Group bases its estimates on historical results, taking into consideration the type of customer, the
type of transaction and the specifics of each arrangement.

Revenue from admission (ticket sales) is recognised on the day of the show or event. The sales are
usually in cash or by credit cards. When the tickets or admission vouchers are prepaid the money
received is recognised as deferred income until the day of the show or event or voucher expiry date.

Revenue from distribution of films is recognised depending on the distribution field on an accrual basis
based on the agreed percentage of ticket sales realised by theatres from the released films or on the sale
of film licence.

Sales of snacks and drinks at cinema bars are recognised when the goods are sold to customers. The
sales are usually in cash or by credit card.

Revenue from alternative content and special events is recognised on the day of the show or event. For
ticketed events, when the tickets or admission vouchers are prepaid the money received is recognised
as deferred income until the day of the show or event or voucher expiry date. For sponsoring campaigns
related to specific alternative content or special event revenue is recognised when the sponsoring
campaign is performed.

Revenue from advertising is recognised when a related advertisement or commercial is screened or an
advertising campaign is performed. In some cases, when services are not relative to a specific
advertising campaign the revenues are recognised as monthly instalments straight line over the period
of the contract.

Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term. When the
Group provides incentives to its customers, the cost of incentives is recognised over the lease term, on a
straight-line basis, as a reduction of rental income.

Services and management charges are recognised in the accounting period in which the services are
rendered.

Revenue arising on a barter transaction is measured at the fair value of goods or services received.
However, if the fair value of the goods or services received cannot be measured reliably, the revenue is
measured at the fair value of the goods or services provided.

**2.** **ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

Revenue from barter transactions involving advertising services is recognised at the fair value of services
provided, measured in relation to non-barter transactions of similar services provided to a different
counter party.

2.23. Cost of sales

Cost of sales consists of:

- Film hire costs and other author rights fees, which are generally payable as an agreed portion of
ticket sales and therefore are recognised once the screening has begun, in line with revenue from
admission based on the rates agreed in the distribution contracts;

- Employee costs related to staff employed in theatres, which are recognised as incurred;

- Cost of concession products, which are recognised when sold to final customers;

- Rental costs which are expensed as incurred;

- Utilities, repairs and maintenance including cleaning and repair services, which are expensed as
incurred;

- Costs of films distributed are capitalised and recognised as Distribution rights on the balance sheet
until the time the films are distributed. Once the films have been distributed, the costs are charged to
the income statement at a rate equal to the ratio of revenue in the period to total estimated revenue
for the films.

2.24. Distribution rights

The Group acquires distribution rights. The cost of acquired distribution rights are capitalised and
recognised in distribution rights on the balance sheet. In the period until distribution begins, they are
only assessed for impairment until the time the films are distributed for screening. Once they begin to be
distributed, the costs are charged to the income statement to the extent that benefits (measured by the
estimated total income from distribution) are consumed at a rate equal to the ratio of revenue in the
period to total estimated revenue for the films and periodically assessed for impairment.

2.25. Leases

Leases of assets, under which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are effectively
retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are
charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.

Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group assumes substantially all the risks and
rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the inception of
the lease at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease
payments. The lease payments are apportioned between a reduction of the outstanding capital liability
and interest in such a way as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of
the liability for each period. The interest element of the finance charge is charged to the consolidated
income statement over the lease period.

The property, plant and equipment held under finance lease contracts is depreciated over the shorter of
the lease term or useful life of the asset, unless there is a reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain
ownership of the leased asset by the end of the lease term.

A sale and leaseback transaction involves the sale of an asset and the leasing back of the same asset.
The accounting treatment of a sale and leaseback transaction depends upon the type of lease involved.
If a sale and leaseback transaction results in a finance lease, any excess of sales proceeds over the
carrying amount are deferred and amortised over the lease term. However when there are indicators that

individually demonstrate that an arrangement may not, in substance, involve a lease under IAS 17 such
as when the Group retains all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership, the primary reason for the
arrangement is to secure financing and achieve a particular tax result or an option is included on terms
that make its exercise almost certain, the sale and leaseback is accounted for as a borrowing with the
asset as security. Payments associated with such transactions are treated as repayment of principal or
interest in the income statement.

If a sale and leaseback transaction results in an operating lease, and it is established at fair value, any
profit or loss is immediately recognised in the consolidated income statement. If the sale price is below
fair value, any profit or loss is recognised immediately except that, if the loss is compensated for by
future lease payments at below market price, when it is deferred and amortised in proportion to the lease
payments over the period for which the asset is expected to be used. If the sale price is above fair value,
the excess over fair value is deferred and amortised over the period for which the asset is expected to be
used.

2.26. Finance income and finance costs

Finance income comprises interest on cash and cash equivalents and foreign exchange gains. The
interest income is recognised in the income statement on an accrual basis, using the effective interest
rate method.

Finance costs comprise interest on loans, borrowings and bonds, bank charges, penalty interest on
overdue payments, unwinding of interest on provisions, costs related to measurement of liabilities based
on amortised cost and foreign exchange losses. The interest expense is recognised using the effective
interest method and is recognised in the income statement in the period to which it relates.

**3.** **FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT**

Financial risk factors

The Group’s principal financial liabilities comprise bonds, bank borrowings, finance leases and trade
payables. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s operations.
The Group has various financial assets such as trade receivables, cash and short-term deposits, which
arise directly from its operations.

The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk and
the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Group’s overall risk management
program seeks to minimise potential adverse effects of financial risks on the financial performance of the
Group.

Interest rate risk


The Group’s activities expose it to a cash flow interest rate risk related to bank borrowings which are at
the variable interest rate. All Gorup’s borrowings are based on WIBOR and EURIBOR and the increase of
these benchmarks can cause an increase in financial costs borne by the Group.

Management does not currently consider that it is cost effective to use financial instruments to hedge, or
to otherwise seek to reduce interest rate risk.

At 31 December 2012, if interest rates had increased/decreased by 100 basis points (2011: 100 basis
points) with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the financial year would have been 1.638
(2011: 1.592) lower/higher as a result of higher/lower interest expense.

**3.** **FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)**

Credit risk

Financial assets, which potentially expose the Group to concentration of credit risk, consist principally of
cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, trade and other receivables (including related party
balances). The Group limits the credit risks arising from cash and cash equivalents by accepting only
reputable banks with good credit ratings.

The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties. It is the Group’s policy that all
customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures. The Group
believes it is not exposed to significant credit risk. The majority of the Group’s revenues are cash based,
which limits the risk of client’s ability to settle their payables. Trade receivables are carried at amortised
cost less an allowance for the impairment resulting from non-recovery and late payment. Credit
concentration of the top five balances measured as a percentage of the Group’s total trade receivables is
as follows:

Liquidity risk

The Group entered into a number of sale and leaseback collateralised borrowing transactions involving
property plant and equipment with a view to securing long term financing. The nature of these
instruments is further discussed in Note 17. The Group intends to enter into further sale and leaseback
collateralised borrowing transactions involving newly acquired property, plant and equipment.

In the year ended 31 December 2009 the Group issued uncollateralised PLN Bonds which are due for
repayment in 2014 (‘Bonds’). Proceeds from the issue of Bonds have been used to repay short-term
loans and borrowings, thus improving the cost effectiveness and structure of the Group’s indebtedness.

The Group plans to finance its operations, including capital expenditure and investments, through a
combination of cash generated from operations, sale and leaseback collateralised borrowing and
finance lease transactions involving newly acquired property, plant and equipment and expected
extention of the existing overdraft facilities.

Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity reserve (which comprises cash and cash
equivalents) on the basis of expected cash flow. As at 31 December 2012 current liabilities exceed
current assets by 71.187 (2011: 65.316). The Group is generating positive operating cash flows that
secure sources for repayment of current liabilities and allow for financing of investments in relation to
which the Group has signed non-cancellable agreements and that are scheduled for 2013.

The table below analyses the Group’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the
remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date. The amounts disclosed in
the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.

**3.** **FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)**

Monthly operating cash inflows allow the Group to settle its current liabilities.

Foreign currency risk

Most of the Group’s revenue and majority of its liabilities are denominated in zloty and is independent of
the current forex rates. Some of the Group’s expenses (related to operating financing leases and sale
and leaseback transactions related to buildings and plant and machinery) are denominated in Euro and
dependent on EUR/PLN forex rates. The percentage of revenue and expenses that are dependent on
forex rates is relatively small as compared to the total scale of operations.

At 31 December 2012, if the zloty had weakened/strengthened by 20% (2011: 20%) against the Euro with
all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been 5.595 (2011: 6.195) lower/
higher, as a result of foreign exchange losses/gains on translation of the borrowings and rent income
and expense.

Estimation of fair value

The carrying value less impairment provision of trade receivables and payables is assumed to
approximate their fair value. The fair value of financial liabilities and assets for disclosure purposes is
estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is
available to the group for similar financial instruments. The carrying values of the Group’s loans,
borrowings and bonds are assumed to approximate their fair values due to lack of material differences
between the actual interest rates of the loans, borrowings and bonds and current market rates.

Capital risk management

The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a
going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to
maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

The Group monitors capital on the basis of the net debt to EBITDA ratio. Net debt is calculated as total
borrowings (including ‘current and non-current borrowings’ as shown in the consolidated balance
sheets) less cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash. EBITDA is defined as operating profit before
(i.e. excluding) depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses.

EBITDA is not an IFRS measure and should not be considered as an alternative to IFRS measures of net
profit/(loss), as an indicator of operating performance, as a measure of cash flow from operations under
IFRS, or as an indicator of liquidity. EBITDA is not a uniform or standardised measure and the calculation
of EBITDA, accordingly, may vary significantly from company to company, and by itself the Group’s
presentation and calculation of EBITDA may not be comparable to that of other companies.

The ratios at 31 December 2012 and at 31 December 2011 were as follows:

**2012** **2011**

Total borrowings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 209.849 220.749

**4.** **CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENT**

Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other
factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances.

The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting
estimates will, by definition, rarely equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
within the next financial year are outlined below.

Estimated impairment

The Group annually tests whether goodwill has suffered any impairment, in accordance with the
accounting policy stated in Note 2.7. For the purposes of assessing the impairment of goodwill, assets
are grouped at the operating segments level.

An operating segment relates to cinema operations in a given geographical area, i.e. ‘Cinema
operations—Poland’, ‘Cinema operations—Baltics’. For more information see Note 5 and Note 8.

Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is
recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The
recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the
purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the level of cash generating units (operating
segments level, which is equivalent to the reporting segment). Non-financial assets other than goodwill
that suffered impairment in prior periods are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each
reporting date.

If indications exist that the assets grouped in the individual cash generating units (cinemas be impaired,
the Group reviews the given cinema for impairment.

The details of the impairement tests are presented in the Note 8.

Depreciation and amortisation rates

Depreciation and amortisation rates are determined based on the estimated economic useful lives of
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. The useful lives are reviewed annually by the
Group based on current estimates. The details relating to the depreciation rates applied by the Group
are presented in Note 2.6.

Barter transactions involving advertising services

The Group enters into barter transactions to provide advertising services in exchange for receiving
advertising or other services from its customer. In accordance with SIC-31 Revenue-Barter Transactions
_Involving Advertising Services, revenue from barter transactions involving advertising is not be measured_
reliably at the fair value of services received. However, under the provisions of SIC-31 the Group can
reliably measure revenue at the fair value of the advertising services it provides in a barter transaction, by
reference to non-barter transactions.

The non-barter transactions that act as a reference point for estimation of barter revenues meet the
following criteria:

- involve advertising similar to the advertising in the barter transaction;

- occur frequently;

- represent a predominant number and value of transactions and amount when compared to all
transactions to provide advertising that is similar to the advertising in the barter transaction;

**4.** **CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENT (CONTINUED)**

- involve cash and/or another form of consideration (e.g. marketable securities, non-monetary
assets, and other services) that has a reliably measurable fair value; and

- do not involve the same counterparty as in the barter transaction.

For details relating to non-cash revenues earned by the Group in the periods covered with these
consolidated financial statements, please refer to Note 5 (the analysis of revenues by category).

Deferred tax asset

The Group recognises deferred tax assets based on the assumption that taxable profits will be available
against which the deferred tax asset can be utilised. Deterioration of future taxable profits might impact
this assumption. Significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of deferred tax
asset that can be recognised, based upon the expected timing and level of future taxable profits together
with future tax planning strategies. The details relating to the carrying value of recognised deferred tax
assets as well as the amount of recognised and unrecognised tax losses at the particular balance sheet
dates are presented in Note 10.

Consideration of current economic environment


The ongoing global liquidity crisis which commenced in the middle of 2007 has resulted in, among other
things, a lower level of capital market funding, lower liquidity levels across the banking sector, and, at
times, higher interbank lending rates and very high volatility in stock markets.

The Group’s management considers further negative changes in the economic environment of the
Group will not have significant effect on operations and on the financial performance of the Group.

**5.** **REPORTING AND OPERATING SEGMENT INFORMATION**

The Group is organised into two main segments:

(1) ‘Cinemas’—including box office, snack and drinks, advertising sales, new streams of revenue
and special events and other;

(2) ‘Film distribution’.

As at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011 an operating segment represents cinema operations in
a given geographical area, i.e. ‘Cinemas—Poland’, ‘Cinemas—Baltics’ and ‘Film Distribution’ reflecting
the level at which Management assesses performance of the cinema operations and allocates resources
within given operation.

As at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011 an operating segment corresponds to a reporting

**8.** **IMPAIRMENT OF NON-CURRENT ASSETS**

_Impairment test as at 31 December 2012_

For the purpose of the preparation of the special purpose consolidated financial statements as at
31 December 2012:

- no impairment indicators were identified for the Group’s cinemas;

- an obligatory annual impairment test in relation to goodwill allocated to the group of cash
generating units within an operating segment ‘Cinemas—Poland’ was performed; an impairment
test performed in relation to goodwill revealed no impairment; additional information on the
methodology of the test performed is given below.

The goodwill of 78.958 was tested at the level of operating segment ‘Cinemas—Poland’. The impairment
test of goodwill and other non-current assets was undertaken based on the value in use and the five year
business plan approved by the Management. The assumptions of the business plan included the

increase of operating profits before depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) and capital expenditures
necessary to maintain the current level of economic benefits expected to arise. In the calculation of the
residual amount, twenty year forecast period was assumed on top of the five year business plan.

The pre-tax 9,5% discount rate was used. This discount rate was derived from the weighted average cost
of capital (WACC) calculated for a capital structure typical for the business sector in which the Group
operates as of 31 December 2012.

As at 30 June 2012, Management has determined that:

- impairment indicators occurred for one of the cinemas; an impairment test performed has indicated
an impairment of assets in an amount of 3.037; the impairment loss has been charged to the
consolidated income statement in the twelve month period ended 31 December 2012 and reduced
the carring value of buildings within the property, plant and equipment as at 31 December 2012 (see
Note 6);

- in connection with the decision to abandon two projects an impairment loss of 1.117 has been
charged to the consolidated income statement in the twelve month period ended 31 December
2012 and reduced the carrying value of assets under constructions within property, plant and
equipment as at 31 December 2012 (see Note 6);

- no impairment indicators were identified for any of the remaining cash generating units,

_Impairment test as at 31 December 2011_

As at 31 December 2011, Management has determined that:

- impairment indicators occurred for one of the cinemas; an impairment test performed has indicated
an impairment of assets in an amount of 11.611; the impairment loss has been charged to the
consolidated income statement in the twelve month period ended 31 December 2011 and reduced
the value of property, plant and equipment as at 31 December 2011 (see Note 6);

- no impairment indicators were identified for any of the remaining cash generating units,

- an obligatory annual impairment test in relation to goodwill allocated to the group of cash
generating units within an operating segment ‘Cinemas—Poland’ was performed; an impairment
test performed in relation to goodwill revealed no impairment; additional information on the
methodology of the test performed is given below.

If the discount rate used for the purpose of this impairment test was higher/lower by 1 pp, an impairment
charge recognised would be higher/lower by 469. If the growth rate after the forecast period used for the
purpose of this impairment test was higher/lower by 1 pp, an impairment charge would be 523 lower/
higher.

As 31 December 2011 the goodwill amounted to 78.958 and is tested at the level of operating segment
‘Cinemas—Poland’ (a total of 21 cinemas as at 31 December 2011, including 7 cinemas and projects
acquired by the Group on 30 June 2008 in Silver Screen subsidiaries acquisition, with goodwill being
allocated to these acquired cinemas and projects as at 31 December 2009).

The impairment test of goodwill and other non-current assets was undertaken based on the value in use
and the five year business plan approved by the Management. The assumptions of the business plan
include the increase of operating profits before depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) and capital
expenditures necessary to maintain the current level of economic benefits expected to arise. In the
calculation of the residual amount, twenty year forecast period was assumed on top of the five year
business plan.
