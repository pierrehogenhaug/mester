##### $375,000,000


# AKUMIN INC.
####   % Senior Secured Notes due 2025
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Akumin Inc. (the “issuer”), a corporation existing under the Ontario Business Corporations Act, is offering $375,000,000 in
aggregate principal amount of    % senior secured notes due 2025 (the “notes”). The notes will bear interest at a rate of
% per annum. The issuer will pay interest on the notes semi-annually in cash in arrears on    and   of each year, beginning
on  , 2021. The notes will mature on   , 2025.
We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to repay in full all outstanding borrowings and terminate all commitments
under our Existing Revolving Credit Facility and our Existing Term Loans (each as defined herein) and to pay related
financing fees and expenses. See “Use of Proceeds.”
The notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, on or after  , 2022 at the redemption prices specified under “Description
of Notes—Optional Redemption,” together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but not including, the
redemption date. At any time prior to  , 2022, the issuer may redeem the notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price
equal to 100% of their principal amount plus a make-whole premium, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
thereon to, but not including, the redemption date. The issuer may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of
the notes at any time prior to  , 2022 with an amount not to exceed the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at
the redemption prices set forth in this offering memorandum plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but not
including, the redemption date. See “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption.” If we sell certain of our assets or
experience specific kinds of changes of control, the issuer must offer to purchase the notes at the prices set forth in this
offering memorandum plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but not including, the date of purchase.
On the issue date, the obligations under the notes will be guaranteed (the “guarantees”), jointly and severally, by each of
the issuer’s wholly-owned restricted subsidiaries, including our professional service affiliates, in each case organized under
the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof. After the issue date, the notes will be guaranteed by each
of our restricted subsidiaries, including professional services affiliates that become a guarantor under our New Revolving
Credit Facility (as defined below) or that guarantee certain other indebtedness of the issuer or any guarantor (subject to
certain exceptions).
The notes and the guarantees (as defined below) will be secured on a first-priority basis by liens on substantially all of the
issuer’s and the guarantors’ tangible and intangible assets (the “Collateral”), subject to certain exceptions and permitted
liens. The liens on the Collateral will be equal and ratable, pursuant to the terms of a first lien intercreditor agreement, with
the indebtedness under our New Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of Notes—Security”.
The notes and the related guarantees will be the issuer’s and the guarantors’ senior secured obligations and will rank equally
in right of payment with any existing and future senior indebtedness, senior in right of payment to any future subordinated
indebtedness, and will rank equally to any existing and future secured indebtedness of the issuer and the guarantors
secured by the Collateral on a first lien basis, including our New Revolving Credit Facility, to the extent of the value of the
assets securing such indebtedness. The notes and the related guarantees will be effectively subordinated to any existing
and future indebtedness that is secured by liens on assets that do not constitute a part of the Collateral to the extent of the
value of such assets. In addition, the notes and the guarantees will be structurally subordinated to any existing and future
indebtedness, claims of holders of preferred stock and other liabilities of any subsidiary of the issuer that is not a guarantor
of the notes.
_Investing in the notes involves a high degree of risk. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 18._


###### Offering Price of Notes:     % plus accrued interest, if any, from     , 2020.

notes may be relying on the exemption from Section 5 of the Securities Act pursuant to Rule 144A. For a description of
certain information about eligible offerees and restrictions on transfers of the notes, see “Transfer Restrictions” and “Plan

The distribution of this offering memorandum and the offering and sale of the notes in certain jurisdictions may be

advisors in making its investment decision and to confirm there are no legal, regulatory or contractual restrictions


-----

prohibiting its investment and whether it is legally permitted to purchase the securities under applicable investment
or similar laws or regulations.

This offering memorandum is being provided on a confidential basis for informational use solely in connection with
consideration of a purchase of the notes (i) to persons reasonably believed to be “qualified institutional buyers” as
defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act, (ii) to other investors in offshore transactions complying with Rule

Akumin is organized under and governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario, and the federal laws of Canada
applicable therein. Some of the directors and officers of the Issuer and the guarantors and certain of the experts
named in this offering memorandum reside outside the United States, and certain assets of such persons are located
outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process for a lawsuit
within the United States upon such persons, including with respect to matters arising under the Securities Act, or to
enforce against any of them, judgments in non-U.S. courts obtained in courts of the United States predicated upon,
among other things, the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws.

Each of the Issuer and each guarantor has appointed CT Corporation System, New York, New York, as its agent for
service of process in the U.S. in respect of any civil suit or action brought against or involving it in a U.S. federal or
state court located in the Borough of Manhattan of the City of New York arising out of, related to or concerning the
offering of the notes.

Such statements may not prove to be accurate and actual results and future events could differ materially from those

economic conditions in geographic areas where we operate.

Various assumptions or factors are typically applied in drawing conclusions or making the forecasts or projections
set out in forward-looking information. Those assumptions and factors are based on information currently available

    - no unforeseen changes in the regulatory environment for our services;

    - a stable competitive environment; and

    - no significant event occurring outside the ordinary course of business such as a natural disaster,
pandemic or other calamity.

Although we have attempted to identify important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from
our plans, strategies, expectations and objectives there may be other factors that could cause our results to differ
from what we currently anticipate, estimate or intend. Forward-looking statements are provided to assist external
stakeholders in understanding management’s expectations and plans relating to the future as of the date of the
original document and may not be appropriate for other purposes. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance
on forward-looking statements. All such statements are made as of the date of this offering memorandum and we
undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information,
future events or otherwise.

We qualify all the forward-looking statements contained in this offering memorandum by the foregoing cautionary
statements.

**CURRENCY AND EXCHANGE RATE INFORMATION**

All dollar amounts referenced in this offering memorandum, unless otherwise indicated are expressed in United
States dollars.

Canada has no system of exchange controls. There are no Canadian restrictions on the repatriation of capital or
earnings of a Canadian company to non-resident investors. There are no laws of Canada or exchange restrictions
affecting the remittance of dividends, interest, royalties or similar payments (subject to any applicable tax
deductions or withholdings) to non-resident holders of our securities.

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

Akumin’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”). Akumin’s
consolidated financial statements are not comparable to the financial statements of U.S. companies prepared in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). There are differences between IFRS
and U.S. GAAP that may be material. In making an investment decision, investors must rely upon their own
examination of our financial position, operations and cash flows, the terms of this offering and the financial
information. Investors should consult their own professional advisor for an understanding of the differences between
IFRS and U.S. GAAP and how those differences might affect such financial information.

The results of operations (including without limitation, statements of income) of ADG Acquisition Holdings, Inc.,
TIC Acquisition Holdings, LLC and SFL Radiology Holdings, LLC, the businesses acquired in connection with the
ADG Acquisitions (as defined herein) are included in our consolidated statements of income (loss) and
comprehensive income (loss) from June 1, 2019 (the date following the date of acquisition) and not for any prior
period. Balance sheet data as of June 30, 2020, December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019 include the businesses
acquired in connection with the ADG Acquisitions. For additional information on the ADG Acquisitions, see Note 3
to our audited financial statements and Note 3 to our unaudited financial statements included elsewhere in this
offering memorandum. In addition, the audited consolidated financial statements of the businesses acquired in the
ADG Acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2018 are included elsewhere in this offering memorandum;


-----

however, no financial information with respect to such companies from January 1, 2019 through May 31, 2019 (the
date of acquisition) is included in this offering memorandum.

**NON-IFRS MEASURES**

This offering memorandum makes reference to certain non-IFRS measures. These non-IFRS measures are not
recognized measures under IFRS and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and are therefore
unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Rather, these non-IFRS measures are
provided as additional information to complement those IFRS measures by providing further understanding of our
results of operations from management’s perspective. Accordingly, these non-IFRS measures should not be
considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of our financial information reported under IFRS. We use nonIFRS financial measures, including “EBITDA”, “Adjusted EBITDA”, “Adjusted EBITDA Normalized for COVID19” and “Adjusted EBITDA Margin”. These non-IFRS measures are used to provide investors with supplemental
measures of our operating performance and thus highlight trends in our core business that may not otherwise be
apparent when relying solely on IFRS measures. We believe the use of these non-IFRS measures, along with IFRS
financial measures, enhances the understanding of our operating results and is useful to us and to investors in
comparing performance with competitors, estimating enterprise value and making investment decisions. We also
believe that securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use non-IFRS measures in the
evaluation of issuers. Our management also uses non-IFRS measures in order to facilitate operating performance
comparisons from period to period, to prepare annual operating budgets and forecasts and to determine components
of management compensation.

We define such non-IFRS measures as follows:

“EBITDA” means net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Akumin before interest expense (net), income
tax expense (recovery) and depreciation and amortization.

“Adjusted EBITDA” means EBITDA as further adjusted for stock-based compensation, impairment of property
and equipment, provisions for certain credit losses, settlement costs, provisions, acquisition-related and public
offering costs, gains (losses) in the period, one time adjustments and IFRS 16 impact on leases.

“Adjusted EBITDA Margin” means Adjusted EBITDA divided by the revenue in the period.

“Free Cash Flow” means Adjusted EBITDA less cash interest paid (excluding IFRS 16 impact on leases) and cash
capital expenditures.

“Adjusted EBITDA Normalized for COVID-19” means Adjusted EBITDA for the LTM period ended June 30,
2020 plus a “COVID-19 Adjustment” of approximately $7 million. This amount was estimated by multiplying the
incremental RVU volume (as calculated in the last sentence of this definition) of approximately 0.303 million RVUs
by: (i) the service fee net revenue per RVU of $47.59 for the LTM period ended June 30, 2020, and (ii) a minimum
incremental contribution margin estimated to be approximately 49%. That minimum incremental contribution
margin assumes that operating costs for employee compensation, reading fees, medical supplies and other expenses
(excluding IFRS 16 impact), which together represented 51% of net revenue for the LTM period ended June 30,
2020, are 100% variable and therefore we believe any incremental $1.00 of revenue equates to $0.49 of incremental
EBITDA. The incremental RVU volume was determined by annualizing the estimated RVU volume for the threemonth period ended September 30, 2020 of approximately 1.485 million RVUs less the actual RVU volume for the
LTM period ended June 30, 2020 of approximately 5.637 million RVUs. Adjusted EBITDA Normalized for
COVID-19 is a non-IFRS financial measure and has been calculated assuming that our estimated RVU volume of
1.485 million RVUs for the three-month period ended September 30, 2020 applied to each quarter in the four quarter
period ended June 30, 2020. There can be no assurance that the RVU volume for the three month period ended
September 30, 2020 will be indicative of any future fiscal quarters nor can there be any assurance that the RVU
volume for the three month period ended September 30, 2020 would have been indicative of the RVU volume for
any quarter included in the LTM period ended June 30, 2020 had the COVID-19 pandemic not affected our business
and the economy generally.

See “Summary – Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information and Other Data” and “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – How We Assess the Performance of our


-----

Business” for a reconciliation of the foregoing non-IFRS measures to their most directly comparable measures
calculated in accordance with IFRS.

publications and surveys, public filings, and our internal sources. Industry publications and surveys generally state

resonance imaging (“MRI”), computed tomography (“CT”), positron emission tomography (“PET”), ultrasound, Xray, mammography as well as other diagnostic and interventional radiology procedures.

We seek to develop leading positions in regional markets in order to leverage operational efficiencies. Our 128
centers are located in seven states, including: Florida (72), Texas (24), Pennsylvania (14), Delaware (8), Georgia (6),
Illinois (3), and Kansas (1). Our scale and density within selected geographies in the United States drives long-term
relationships with key payors, radiology groups and referring physicians. Our operations team is dedicated to
meeting our standards of patient care, managing relationships with local physicians and payors and improving
profitability. We provide corporate training programs, standardize policies and procedures and share best practices
among the physicians in our regional networks so that they can be implemented.

Our scalable and integrated operating platform supports our ability to drive organic growth, realize cost efficiencies
and create value from integrating acquisitions. Strategic acquisitions and organic growth have helped us strengthen
our position in core geographies. Since our inception, we have successfully integrated more than 100 outpatient
diagnostic imaging centers into our platform. In our highly fragmented market, we are the second largest publicly
traded provider of outpatient diagnostic imaging services, with the top 5 operators representing approximately 12%
of total U.S. outpatient imaging centers. We believe our scale and track record of being able to achieve material cost
synergies enable us to successfully compete for acquisitions against smaller operators in overlapping markets and
potential new entrants in markets where we have an existing presence.

Substantially all of our revenue is derived, directly or indirectly, from fees charged for diagnostic imaging services
performed at our centers. This stream of revenue is diversified across multiple geographies, mixed modality
offerings and a number of different payors. We report volume of diagnostic imaging procedures based on relative
value units (“RVUs”). RVUs are a standard measure of value used in the U.S. Medicare reimbursement formula for
physician services. Our RVUs in the twelve-month period ended June 30, 2020 were 5.637 million compared to
4.098 million in the twelve-month period ended June 30, 2019. Furthermore, RVUs in the three-month period ended
September 30, 2020 are expected to be approximately 1.485 million. Although RVUs for the three-month period
ended September 30, 2020 are not yet finalized, this estimate reflects our preliminary expectations for RVUs for the
period based on information currently available to us. The below charts provide the breakdown of our RVUs across
modalities and payors for the last twelve-month period ended June 30, 2020:


-----

**Modality and Payor Mix (by RVUs)**


For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, our net revenues were $271 million and Adjusted EBITDA was $67
million. Normalized for the impact of COVID-19, based on annualizing our RVUs for the three month period ended
September 30, 2020, we believe we would have had net revenues of $285 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $74
million for the twelve-month period ended June 30, 2020. See “—Recent Developments—COVID-19” and
“Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information and Other Data” for a reconciliation of
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Normalized for COVID-19 to the most comparable IFRS measure.

**Industry Overview**

**_Essential Healthcare Service Industry Poised for Consolidation_**

Outpatient diagnostic imaging centers are primarily used to provide internal imaging services to patients referred by
a third-party physician. Standard offerings include imaging procedures such as X-ray and ultrasound along with
more complex and costly services, such as MRI, CT, PET and mammography in addition to other diagnostic and
interventional radiology procedures. By providing diagnostic imaging services in a more cost effective setting
compared to traditional hospitals, outpatient diagnostic imaging centers are able to cater to the diverse needs of their
markets and in turn, have become one of the fastest growing sectors in healthcare.

The size of the freestanding outpatient diagnostic imaging market in the United States is estimated at more than $19
billion in annual industry revenue. The diagnostic imaging market is highly competitive, consisting of owneroperator radiologists, freestanding outpatient diagnostic imaging centers and hospitals. We also face competition
from other diagnostic imaging companies in acquiring diagnostic imaging centers. According to publicly available
sources, there are estimated to be more than 6,000 freestanding outpatient diagnostic imaging centers in the United
States. The landscape in the outpatient diagnostic imaging industry is highly fragmented. This fragmentation is
evidenced by the top 5 players representing only approximately 12% of the total market share of outpatient imaging
centers, a prime indicator of market consolidation potential. Akumin’s primary competitors in terms of scale are
RadNet, CDI and SimonMed Imaging.

We believe the outpatient diagnostic imaging industry will remain stable for the foreseeable future. Contributing to
this outlook is the expectation of stable Medicare reimbursement rates, increasing imaging volumes and growing
acceptance of imaging procedures. Since becoming a mainstream medical diagnostic mechanism in the 1990’s, the
utilization of diagnostic imaging has drastically increased. Over the last few decades, the imaging industry has
developed significantly through improvements in technology, the development of various imaging venues
(outpatient vs. hospital), and the continued increase in the number of patients seeking out imaging procedures.

Large outpatient imaging center operators, such as Akumin, are in a position to benefit from these industry
dynamics. Scale, reputation and operating excellence will likely be key drivers of performance for the various
industry players.


-----

**_Stable Pricing Environment_**

After a downward trend in reimbursement from 2007 to 2014, Medicare reimbursements have generally stabilized.
From 2015 to 2020, there has been limited fluctuation in reimbursements. The stabilized reimbursement
environment has allowed operators to accurately forecast their financial needs and more appropriately run their
operations.


**Figure 1: Top 5 MRI CPT Codes**


**_Freestanding Imaging is an Attractive Alternative to Hospitals_**

The gap in pricing between traditional hospital and freestanding outpatient facilities has increased over time. In
effect, this has caused a shift in policy for payors. In an effort to curtail costs, commercial payors, specifically
Anthem and United Healthcare, have begun to transition away from traditional hospital imaging and move towards
recommending, or in some cases, requiring imaging to take place at outpatient facilities. In 2017, Anthem
announced it would no longer fund various advanced imaging procedures at hospital-based facilities due to the
substantial price difference between hospital-based procedures and outpatient-based procedures. UnitedHealthcare’s
policy now requires a site-of-care authorization prior to the imaging procedures taking place. As commercial and
government payors continue to squeeze budgets and healthcare costs continue to rise, this gap is expected to
continue to increase.

Historical pricing pressures from government and commercial payors, along with increased requirements for preauthorization of advanced diagnostic procedures (in an effort to ensure the medical necessity of tests in the United
States and to enforce national clinical guidelines for imaging services) are expected to help drive some procedure
volume from hospitals to freestanding outpatient facilities. Moreover, the combination of pricing pressure and
favorable volume outlook for outpatient imaging centers have facilitated consolidation in the sector and created a
favorable environment for operators of scale.

**Favorable Market Tailwinds**

**_Aging Demographics_**

The population aged 65 years and older in the United States is expected to increase significantly, largely owing to
the subset of aging baby boomers. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the “65+” population will outnumber
individuals under the age of 18 by 2034. As the overall U.S. population continues to age, the need for affordable and
easily accessible healthcare procedures will expand proportionally. According to the U.S. Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services, senior citizens, defined as those who are 65 years old or older, made up only 13% of the total
U.S. population, yet accounted for 34% of healthcare-related spending. The vast growth in the elderly population is
expected to positively impact the financial landscape of the overall healthcare industry.

**_Greater Consumer Awareness for Earlier Intervention and Preventative Screening_**

Greater consumer awareness for early intervention, increased emphasis on preventive screening and many
technological advances have changed the perception of imaging from a luxury service to an essential part of the


-----

diagnostic process. Additionally, we believe that further technological advancements will allow for even earlier
diagnosis of diseases and disorders through less invasive methods, further driving demand for diagnostic imaging
services.

There is significant benefit for patients and payors in stopping a health issue before it begins. As such, commercial
payors have continued to shift their views of imaging procedures towards encouraging and allowing further
preventative screenings to help cut costs in the long run. Additionally, the industry is seeing a shift towards the
adoption of innovative technology in areas such as Artificial Intelligence (“AI”)which has the potential to transform
diagnostic imaging and help with early diagnosis.

**Competitive Strengths**

**_Leading Outpatient Diagnostic Imaging Provider in the United States_**

We pride ourselves on our commitment to excellence and were founded with a focus on helping today’s healthcare
consumers become more active participants in managing their health. Akumin leverages its combined clinical
experience and the latest advances in technology and information systems, to offer hospital-level expertise within a
local setting. Through education, innovation and patient engagement, we have become one of the leading providers
of outpatient diagnostic imaging services in the United States. Akumin strives to provide quality service, short wait
and turnaround times and convenience to all patients. As at June 30, 2020, we operated 128 imaging centers,
entrenching our position as the second largest publicly traded provider of diagnostic imaging services in the United
States.

As Akumin continues to grow, we will continue to experience enhanced benefits of scale such as unlocking
additional physician referrals in markets with center network density and enabling stronger partnerships with payors.
This will help further drive growth and margins while creating even more operating leverage with a centralized
management team and service delivery.

The following table shows the number of Akumin diagnostic imaging facilities as of the dates indicated:

Facilities ..................................... 128 129 96 74

**_Stable and Diversified Revenue Base_**

Akumin benefits from a well-diversified stream of revenues that span multiple geographies, modality offerings and
physician networks. We operate diagnostic imaging centers in 7 states, each located in densely populated
metropolitan areas. Each market leverages a network of radiologists with some radiologists working on-site and
others working remotely. Given our vast network of radiologists and dynamic IT platform, we do not rely heavily on
any single radiologist to drive business. Our scale and density within selected geographies allows us to create close,
long-term relationships with local radiology groups and referring physicians.

Our multi-modality imaging offering provides a one-stop-shop for patients and referring physicians. MRI, CT and
ultrasound accounted for 78% of total RVUs generated by us in the twelve-month period ended June 30, 2020. MRI
and CT offer higher margins resulting in our attractive modality mix. Further, as imaging becomes standard in
preventive screenings, MRI, CT and ultrasound will become more commonplace. The remaining modalities offered
are typically utilized for specific purposes on a case-by-case basis.

Akumin enjoys a diversified payor mix which leverages relationships with major commercial payors and important
federally funded programs such as Medicare. Substantially all of our revenues are derived from in-network
providers. We are able to leverage our scale and density in core markets to partner with payors looking for low-cost
imaging alternatives to traditional hospitals.

We believe we are the ideal imaging partner for payors who seek to provide high quality care to patients at a low
cost. By partnering with the vast majority of all major payors in our geographic footprint, we are able to provide
significant savings to our payor partners by ensuring patients stay within their networks using our system of


-----

conveniently located facilities. Payor reimbursement levels are negotiated via contracts with each individual payor.
These contracts allow for separate reimbursement schedules for each of the payor’s respective clients, depending on
the members’ individual coverage plan.

**_Proven Growth Strategy_**

We have deployed a growth strategy that drives growth via both organic and inorganic means. Our organic growth
strategy is based on a marketing platform which utilizes relationships with local referring physicians to drive new
business. Additionally, in markets with robust demand, we will consider adding modalities in centers that are
currently only single or dual modality centers. Multi-modality centers help diversify risk while contributing
positively to our margins. To attain growth and offer a competitive differentiator in key markets, we will also
consider replacing or adding new technologies and equipment. While reimbursement rates may not change with
newer equipment, we believe this strategy will offer us a market advantage which will ultimately lead to increased
volumes. An example of this is our investment in 3D digital mammography, which is now being reimbursed by
many of the large national insurance payors in addition to Medicare.

Akumin stresses the importance of operational excellence which ultimately manifests itself in shorter wait times. In
an effort to capitalize on organic growth opportunities, we employ a marketing strategy that places the utmost
importance on relationships with third-party referring physicians. Referring physicians drive a material portion of
our revenues. To ensure the continued strength of relationships with referring physicians, we employ a marketing
team whose primary responsibility is establishing new relationships and maintaining existing relationships with
referring physicians. Relationships with new referring physicians are developed through our value proposition (i.e.
consistent service, contracts with substantially all payors, convenience and access to top subspecialty radiologists).
Existing relationships are maintained by ensuring we continue to deliver our value proposition in a consistent
manner.

The table above shows year-over-year RVU growth on a same-center basis excluding the 2020 Acquisitions (as
defined below) and the 2019 Acquisitions (as defined below), except for the Davie Acquisition and pro-rating for
the Deltona Acquisition and the ADG Acquisitions (each as defined below).

**_Incremental Benefits of Organic Growth_**

We are able to further drive profitability by leveraging our scale to further improve margins. The following
operating costs, as disclosed in our financial statements, are variable or semi-variable in nature: employee
compensations (as organic growth does not require additions to certain corporate and back office functions), reading
fees, medical supplies and other expenses. These costs, in the aggregate, make up 51% of net revenue on a LTM
basis as of June 30, 2020. Given the variable and semi-variable nature of these cost components, we believe that
$1.00 of additional organic revenue growth at our existing imaging centers generates a minimum of approximately
$0.49 of incremental Adjusted EBITDA growth with the potential for higher margin contribution given the semivariable nature of employee compensation.


-----

**_Well Positioned as a High Growth Consolidator_**

The outpatient diagnostic imaging market in the United States is highly fragmented. According to publicly available
sources, there are estimated to be more than 6,000 outpatient diagnostic imaging centers operating in the United
States. The top 5 players by number of centers represent approximately 12% of the total U.S. outpatient imaging
centers.

Changing legislation and regulation are expected to impact spending in the healthcare sector. As a result, the
industry is expecting insurance providers to consolidate, leading to fewer, large insurance providers with more
bargaining power. Small imaging operators will see margins tighten providing an opportunity for large consolidators
to acquire assets at attractive valuations. Akumin’s scale, reputation and successful history of integrating
acquisitions makes it the ideal partner for smaller imaging operators.

The increasing barriers to entry limit access to the market for new entrants due to the limited desire from payors to
enter into new network contracts, high startup costs associated with opening new freestanding imaging centers, the
continued significant capital investment required for maintaining and upgrading equipment, and the increasing costs
of regulatory compliance.

**_Proven Acquisition Strategy_**

Our acquisition strategy is led by our President and Chief Executive Officer, Riadh Zine. Mr. Zine has grown Akumin
through a carefully executed, highly acquisitive, strategy based on a distinct set of criteria: (i) market density,
(ii) market growth potential, (iii) operational integration potential, (iv) assets and compliance assessment, and
(v) attractive valuation multiples. Of the multiple factors, market density plays the most significant role. We look to
acquire individual or portfolios of centers that have a meaningful presence in their respective market. An increased
geographic footprint improves our ability to partner with commercial payors. We expect to focus our acquisition
growth in markets where we currently maintain a significant foothold; however, acquisitions of material size in new
markets remain possible. Once we have gained market density, management begins dialogue with smaller local
operators to build trust over time and establish the foundation for attractive future in-market, tuck-in acquisitions.

**_Value from Integrating Acquisitions_**

The consumer is at the heart of our strategy as increasing out of pocket costs are changing consumer behavior in
healthcare services. For example, the percentage of U.S. workers enrolled in high deductible plans with a health
savings account increased from approximately 4% in 2007 to approximately 19% in 2017. Our commitment to
operational excellence and service delivery optimizes the consumer’s experience at our clinics.

We provide a consistent customer experience, standardized through technology and investments in our people and
processes. All patient facing employees are trained on delivering the Akumin brand, which strives to provide
engaging, innovative and inclusive services to all. After appropriate integration periods following acquisitions,
individual centers are expected to be designed for remodel with interiors and signage expected to be put in place to
conform with the standard Akumin facility design.

Our branding strategy is focused on aligning our position in the market in the space between traditional hospitals
and outpatient clinics. By combining the best qualities of these diagnostic imaging providers, we hope to become the
go-to provider of outpatient diagnostic imaging services to all patients in our service areas. We strive to provide
shorter waiting times, convenient locations, competitive fees, quality equipment and software, subspecialty
radiologists and top-tier expertise and consistency.

As we continue to scale our operations, cost synergies associated with each acquisition will become more impactful.

**_Strong Alignment of Interest_**

We have assembled a management team with extensive experience and deep-domain expertise in all aspects:
Operations, Finance, Legal & Compliance, Revenue Cycle Management, Clinical Development, Technology
Solutions, and Branding & Business Development.


-----

The equity ownership of our directors and officers provides strong alignment of interests with all stakeholders given
focus on long term value creation. In addition, equity has been issued in the past to fund larger acquisitions. Issuing
equity reduces the leverage risks relating to the acquisition growth strategy and helps maintain a flexible capital
structure and manageable leverage ratios.

**Business Strategy**

**_Diverse Service Offerings Centered on Patient Needs_**

As consumerism continues to emerge in healthcare, we are committed to putting the patient at the center of our
brand strategy. We plan to continue to organize our service offerings based upon patient needs. This may include
specialty imaging, women’s imaging needs and personal injury imaging in addition to traditional imaging needs. By
providing these service offerings, we are able to more closely relate to our consumers and be responsive to their
needs. This strategy also has the benefit of expanding revenue streams and diversifying market segments and
consumer demand.

We place a high emphasis on these broad service offerings and providing access to multi-modality procedures.
Doing so allows us to become a one-stop shop for patients, referring physicians and payors, giving them access to
full slate of imaging procedures through a modality mix which includes: MRI, CT, PET/CT, ultrasound,
Mammography, bone density (DEXA), x-ray and other screening, diagnostic or interventional procedures.

**_Focus on Service Delivery & Operations_**

Our entrepreneurial culture promotes innovation. We intend to continue to invest in technology to help strengthen
our infrastructure, workflow processes and centralized data information platforms. We are standardizing our
transaction workflow process in order to provide an efficient and effective service for all parties involved. Our
centralized platforms and back office functions are improving service delivery and are decreasing the administrative
burden placed on our centers. The ultimate goal is a consistent consumer experience across our service offerings on
the Akumin platform.

**_Prioritizing Clinical Outcomes_**

Standardizing clinical protocols is also a priority for Akumin to ensure consistent patient care and radiologist
efficiency. In addition, the radiology industry is adopting AI as a means of supporting radiologists’ ability to
identify and monitor critical findings for our patients. We intend to connect our operating systems to these AI tools
and libraries to improve clinical outcomes. We also hope to improve the overall experience of care for patients to
provide not just diagnostic but also increased screening procedures so that more patients learn about their health
risks and predispositions, and consequently we can help prevent disease in the first place.

Further, we also plan to invest in advanced software and equipment to provide the latest available procedures.
These upgrades not only help provide consistent service, they also provide an attractive return on investment
through increased volumes as a result of increased referrals and efficiency.

**_Maintaining Strong Relationships with Referring Physicians, Radiologists and Payors_**

We maintain strong relationships with referring physicians as they are the source of our patients and therefore our
revenue base. Providing a consistent level of service, quick turnaround time for radiology reports, and timely access
to relevant information are key to maintaining a strong relationship with referring physicians.

We engage large pools of radiologists, many of whom are fellowship trained subspecialty radiologists, located in or
near to the markets we serve. We build relationships with these subspecialty trained radiologists, who are generally
compensated on a per-read basis. Our relationships with subspecialty trained radiologists ensure proper coverage in
our markets and that radiology reports can be provided within our required service standards. Contracts are
negotiated with individual radiologists and radiology groups on a stand-alone basis, meaning that the Company does
not have a standard per-read price.


-----

Akumin builds relationships with payors in each state it serves by looking to build density in multiple markets in
each state. This strategy makes us relevant to those payors and allows us to provide a low cost, reliable imaging
provider solution for those payors and their members.

**_Disciplined Organic and Acquisition Growth_**

We have a strategic and thoughtful approach to growth that is focused on profitability over the long term. Our
future growth will be comprised of organic growth as well as opportunistic acquisitions. Organic growth will be a
combination of marketing and operational initiatives to increase volumes in our existing clinics, introducing new
service offerings in our key markets and opening new centers where supported by consumer demand. We expect the
near term focus of our acquisition growth will be in the markets where we currently maintain a significant foothold.

**Recent Developments**

**_COVID-19_**

Commencing during the three-month period ended March 31, 2020, and continuing through the present and beyond,
a pandemic relating to the novel coronavirus known as COVID-19 occurred causing significant financial market
disruption and social dislocation. The pandemic is dynamic, with various cities, counties, states and countries around
the world responding or having responded in different ways to address and contain the outbreak, including the
declaration of a global pandemic by the World Health Organization, a National State of Emergency in the United
States and state and local executive orders and ordinances forcing the closure of non-essential businesses and
persons not employed in or using essential services to “stay at home” or “shelter in place”. At this stage, we have no
certainty as to how long the pandemic, or a more limited epidemic, will last, what regions will be most affected or to
what extent containment measures will be applied. Imaging centers are healthcare facilities, and as such, are
generally considered an essential service and expected to continue to operate during the pandemic. However, there is
potential that actions taken by government, referring physicians or individual actions, in response to containment or
avoidance of this coronavirus, could impact a patient’s ability or decision to seek imaging services at a given time,
which could have a significant impact on volume at our imaging centers leading to temporary or prolonged staff
layoffs, reduced hours, closures and other cost containment efforts. Further, there is potential that certain services
which are not urgent and can be deferred without significant harm to a patient’s health may be delayed, either by us
in response to local laws or good public health practice or voluntarily by the patient. In addition, there is potential
that the outbreak of the coronavirus could impact supply chains, including our supply of personal protective
equipment, and lead to personnel shortages, each of which could impact our ability to safely perform imaging
services. It is also possible that social distancing efforts and sanitization and decontamination procedures could
cause delays in the performance of imaging services. Depending on the severity and duration of the COVID-19
pandemic, there is potential for us to incur incremental credit losses beyond what is currently expected and potential
reduction in revenue and income and asset impairments. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We
face various risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks, including the global outbreak of COVID 19,
which may have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.”

**_Liquidity and New Revolving Credit Facility_**

In addition, at June 30, 2020, we had $28.1 million cash-on-hand, an increase of $11.5 million in the cash position
from March 31, 2020, mainly due to Free Cash Flow generation of $4.9 million, and the receipt of a $1.1 million
grant from Health and Human Services (“HHS”) and accelerated Medicare payments of $3.1 million under the
expanded Accelerated and Advance Payments Program from Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”).
The Company expects its liquidity position, pro forma for the offering of the notes and application of the proceeds
contemplated hereby and the entry into the New Revolving Credit Facility, to remain adequate to fund our working
capital requirements, debt obligations, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other cash requirements.

Concurrently with the offering of the notes, the Company expects to enter into a new senior secured revolving credit
facility between, inter alios, certain lenders party thereto and BBVA USA, as administrative agent and collateral
agent, which is expected to provide commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $75 million and maturing on
October 31, 2025 (the “New Revolving Credit Facility”). The New Revolving Credit Facility is expected to contain
market terms and conditions as more fully described herein. See “Description of Certain Other Indebtedness.”


-----

While we expect to enter into the New Revolving Credit Facility on the issue date, we cannot assure you that the
New Revolving Credit Facility will be effective on the issue date on terms described herein or at all. The offering of
the notes is not conditioned upon the effectiveness of the New Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, although we
are seeking revolving credit commitments of up to $75 million from financial institutions, no assurance can be made
that we will be able to secure revolving commitments in this amount (or at all) and the actual amount of revolving
credit commitments under our New Revolving Credit Facility may be less than $75 million.

Affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers are expected to be lenders and/or agents under the New Revolving
Credit Facility and will receive customary fees and expenses in connection therewith. See “Plan of Distribution.”

**_Government Payments_**

During April 2020, we received approximately $1.1 million under the first appropriation made by HHS to Medicare
providers pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”). Additional grants
may be available to us through subsequent appropriations under this program. Further, we received approximately
$3.1 million of accelerated Medicare payments under the expanded Accelerated and Advance Payments Program
from CMS. These payments are to be repaid beginning one year after their receipt in April through the adjudication
of Medicare claims over a future period.

subsidiaries held approximately 3% of our total assets and approximately
0.5% of our total liabilities.

**Intercreditor**
**Agreement...................................** On the issue date, we will enter into a first lien intercreditor agreement (the
“First Lien Intercreditor Agreement”) with the notes collateral agent, the
trustee, the administrative agent under our New Revolving Credit Facility, the

and other leases), including both the current and non-current portions. Other lease liabilities were $135,322, $128,684, $124,586 and $0 as
of June 30, 2020, December 31, 2019, June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.
(2) Total debt at face value, excluding other lease liabilities consists of total debt, excluding other lease liabilities except that the borrowing
under the Existing Credit Agreement, subordinated notes (settled during the three-month period ended June 30, 2019) and Wesley Chapel
Loan is noted at face value. Other lease liabilities were $135,322, $128,684, $124,586 and $0 as of June 30, 2020, December 31, 2019, June
30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.
(3) As Adjusted Total Secured Debt is total debt at face value excluding other lease liabilities that is secured by liens on our assets as of June
30, 2020 after giving effect to the issuance of the notes and the application of the proceeds therefrom. See “Capitalization” and “Use of
Proceeds”.
(4) As Adjusted Total Net Secured Debt is total debt at face value excluding other lease liabilities that is secured by liens on our assets as of
June 30, 2020 after giving effect to the issuance of the notes and the application of the proceeds therefrom minus $29.4 million of
unrestricted cash. See “Capitalization” and “Use of Proceeds”.

**Non-IFRS Metrics:**

We present certain non-IFRS measures. These non-IFRS measures are not recognized measures under IFRS and do
not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar
measures presented by other companies. Rather, these non-IFRS measures are provided as additional information to
complement our IFRS measures by providing further understanding of our results of operations from management’s
perspective. Accordingly, these non-IFRS measures should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for
analysis of our financial information reported under IFRS. We use non-IFRS financial measures, including
“EBITDA”, “Adjusted EBITDA”, “Adjusted EBITDA Margin”, “Adjusted EBITDA Normalized for COVID-19”
and “Free Cash Flow”. These non-IFRS measures are used to provide investors with supplemental measures of our
operating performance and thus highlight trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent when
relying solely on IFRS measures. We believe the use of these non-IFRS measures, along with IFRS financial
measures, enhances the understanding of our operating results and is useful to us and to investors in comparing


-----

performance with competitors, estimating enterprise value and making investment decisions. We also believe that
securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use non-IFRS measures in the evaluation of
issuers. Our management also uses non-IFRS measures in order to facilitate operating performance comparisons
from period to period, to prepare annual operating budgets and forecasts and to determine components of
management compensation. In addition, these non-IFRS measures should not be considered as an alternative to net
income or any other performance measures in accordance with IFRS.

COVID-19 Adjustment[(i)]............................ **7,027**

**Adjusted EBITDA Normalized for**
**COVID-19[(i)] ..............................................** **73,988**

(i) Adjusted EBITDA Normalized for COVID-19 is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA for the LTM period ended June 30, 2020 plus a
“COVID-19 Adjustment” of approximately $7 million. This amount was estimated by multiplying the incremental RVU volume (as
calculated in the last sentence of this definition) of approximately 0.303 million RVUs by: (a) the service fee net revenue per RVU of
$47.59 for the LTM period ended June 30, 2020, and (b) a minimum incremental contribution margin estimated to be approximately


-----

49%. That minimum incremental contribution margin assumes that operating costs for employee compensation, reading fees, medical
supplies and other expenses (excluding IFRS 16 impact), which together represented 51% of net revenue for the LTM period ended
June 30, 2020, are 100% variable and therefore we believe any incremental $1.00 of revenue equates to $0.49 of incremental
EBITDA. The incremental RVU volume was determined by annualizing the estimated RVU volume for the three-month period ended
September 30, 2020 of approximately 1.485 million RVUs less the actual RVU volume for the LTM period ended June 30, 2020 of
approximately 5.637 million RVUs. Adjusted EBITDA Normalized for COVID-19 is a non-IFRS financial measure and has been
calculated assuming that our estimated RVU volume of 1.485 million RVUs for the three-month period ended September 30, 2020
applied to each quarter in the four quarter period ended June 30, 2020. There can be no assurance that the RVU volume for the three
month period ended September 30, 2020 will be indicative of any future fiscal quarters nor can there be any assurance that the RVU
volume for the three month period ended September 30, 2020 would have been indicative of the RVU volume for any quarter included
in the LTM period ended June 30, 2020 had the COVID-19 pandemic not affected our business and the economy generally.

(2) Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Revenues.

(4) As Adjusted Total Net Secured Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Normalized for COVID-19 is calculated as the ratio of total net secured debt (net
of $29.4 million of unrestricted cash) at face value, excluding other lease liabilities, of $366.1 million to LTM Adjusted EBITDA
Normalized for COVID-19 and As Adjusted Total Secured Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Normalized for COVID-19 is calculated as the ratio
of total secured debt at face value, excluding other lease liabilities, of $395.5 million to LTM Adjusted EBITDA Normalized for COVID19, in each case as of June 30, 2020, on a pro forma basis after taking into account the offering of the notes hereby and the application of the
proceeds therefrom as described herein and excluding up to $75 million available to be drawn under the New Revolving Credit Facility.
Adjusted EBITDA Normalized for COVID-19 is a non-IFRS financial measure and has been calculated assuming that our estimated RVU
volume of 1.485 million RVUs for the three-month period ended September 30, 2020 applied to each quarter in the four quarter period
ended June 30, 2020. There can be no assurance that the RVU volume for the three month period ended September 30, 2020 will be
indicative of any future fiscal quarters nor can there be any assurance that the RVU volume for the three month period ended September 30,
2020 would have been indicative of the RVU volume for any quarter included in the LTM period ended June 30, 2020 had the COVID-19
pandemic not affected our business and the economy generally.

**RISK FACTORS**

_You should carefully consider each of the following risk factors, together with all of the information set forth in this_
_offering memorandum, before deciding to invest in the notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not_
_the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or those we currently deem_
_immaterial, may also become important and material factors that affect us. If any of the following risks and_
_uncertainties develops into actual events, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or_
_prospects could be materially adversely affected and you could lose all or part of your original investment._

**Risks Related to Our Business**

**_We face various risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks, including the global outbreak of_**
**_COVID-19, which may have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations_**
**_and cash flows._**

On January 31, 2020, the Secretary of U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) declared a national
public health emergency due to a novel coronavirus. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared
the outbreak of COVID-19, a disease caused by this novel coronavirus, a pandemic. This disease continues to spread
throughout the United States and other parts of the world. The COVID-19 pandemic is significantly affecting our
employees, patients, facilities, communities and business operations, as well as the U.S. and Canadian economy and
financial markets. As the COVID-19 crisis continues to evolve, the full extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak will
impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity will depend on future developments that
are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted. For example, we are not able to predict or control the
severity or duration of the pandemic, including whether there will be additional periods of increases in the number
of COVID-19 cases in areas in which we operate, the timing and availability of effective medical treatments and
vaccines or the efficacy of public health controls.

At this stage, we have no certainty as to how long the pandemic, or a more limited epidemic, will last, what regions
will be most affected or to what extent containment measures will be applied. Imaging centers are healthcare
facilities and as such are generally considered an essential service and expected to continue to operate during any
epidemic or pandemic. However, there is potential that actions taken by government, or referring physicians or
individual actions, in response to containment or avoidance of this coronavirus could impact a patient’s ability or
decision to seek imaging services at a given time which could have a significant impact on volume at our imaging
centers leading to temporary or prolonged staff layoffs, reduced hours, closures and other cost containment efforts.
Further, there is potential that certain services which are not urgent and can be deferred without significant harm to a
patient’s health may be delayed, either by us in response to local laws or good public health practice or voluntarily
by the patient. In addition, there is potential that the outbreak of the coronavirus could impact supply chains,
including our supply of personal protective equipment, and lead to personnel shortages, each of which could impact
our ability to safely perform imaging services. It is also possible that social distancing efforts and sanitization and
decontamination procedures could cause delays in the performance of imaging services. Depending on the severity
and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is potential for us to incur incremental credit losses beyond what is
currently expected and potential reduction in revenue and income and asset impairments.

We face various risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks, including the global outbreak of COVID-19.
The COVID-19 pandemic, changes in patient behavior related to illness, pandemic fears and market downturns, and
restrictions intended to slow the spread of COVID-19, including quarantines, government-mandated actions,
stay-at-home orders and other restrictions, have led to disruption of our business and volatility in the global capital
markets. The United States government has taken steps to attempt to mitigate some of the more severe anticipated
economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the passage of the CARES Act. Additionally, we have
received certain funding and other relief under the CARES Act, as described more fully herein. Nonetheless, no
assurance that such types of measures and funding whether already enacted or to be enacted will be effective or
achieve their desired results in a timely fashion, including as it relates to our business operations. Moreover, while
we believe we are in compliance with the applicable terms and conditions of funding under the CARES Act,
compliance-related guidance for the program remains in process, and we may face enforcement risk if we are found
to have failed to comply with such terms and conditions.


-----

If significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,
including because of illness, quarantines, facility closures, ineffective remote work arrangements, supply chain
disruptions or technology failures or limitations, our operations would be adversely impacted. We have already
incurred and will continue to incur additional costs related to protecting the health and well-being and meeting the
needs of our patients, employees, medical staff members and contractors. We expect to continue to incur additional
costs, which may be significant, as we continue to implement operational changes in response to this pandemic. We
may also face liability to the extent we receive claims from our employees, customers or related third-parties
alleging exposure to COVID-19 in connection with our operations or at one of our facilities. In addition, we may be
subject to a governmental enforcement action if we fail to comply with applicable health and safety regulations.

Our results of operations have been and will be negatively impacted by these developments. In addition, changes to
statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies or practices as a result of, or in response to COVID-19, could affect us in
substantial and unpredictable ways. Although social contact restrictions have eased across the U.S. and most states
have lifted moratoriums on non-emergent procedures, some restrictions remain in place, and some states are reimposing certain restrictions due to increasing rates of COVID-19 cases. Further, additional closings and restrictions
on hours and services may occur for an unpredictable amount of time. In particular, we have significant operations
in geographies that are deemed “hot spots” such as Florida and Texas, two of our major markets, that continue to
experience increases in COVID-19 infections. Due to the concentration of our facilities in Texas and Florida, we are
particularly sensitive to the increase in COVID-19 cases in those states, where the pandemic could have a
disproportionate effect on our business. Given the many uncertainties and far reaching consequences of potential
developments, we cannot ensure that the COVID-19 outbreak and the many related impacts will not require
extended or additional imaging center closures and other disruptions to our business or will not materially and
adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition in fiscal 2020 and beyond.

Broad economic factors resulting from the current COVID-19 pandemic, including high unemployment and
underemployment rates and reduced consumer spending and confidence, also affect our service mix, revenue mix
payer mix and patient volumes, as well as our ability to collect outstanding receivables. Business closings and
layoffs in the areas where we operate may lead to increases in the uninsured and underinsured populations and
adversely affect demand for our services, as well as the ability of patients and other payers to pay for services
rendered. Any increase in the amount or deterioration in the collectability of patient accounts receivable will
adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations, requiring an increased level of working capital. In addition,
our results and financial condition may be adversely affected by federal, state or local laws, regulations, orders, or
other governmental or regulatory actions addressing the current COVID-19 pandemic or the U.S. health care system,
which could result in direct or indirect restrictions to our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
flow.

**_Our strategy to grow our business through acquisitions is subject to significant risks._**

A key component of our strategy to grow our business is to complete additional outpatient diagnostic imaging center
acquisitions to expand our product range and increase our revenues. Accordingly, we will be dependent upon our
ability to enter into acquisition agreements that we believe are consistent with our business strategy. Risks in
acquiring new outpatient diagnostic imaging centers include: (a) our ability to locate new centers that are attractive
and complement our business; and (b) our ability to acquire these centers at attractive acquisition prices. We also
face competition from other outpatient diagnostic imaging companies in acquiring outpatient diagnostic imaging
centers, which makes it more difficult to find attractive products on acceptable terms. Accordingly, we may not be
able to acquire rights to additional outpatient diagnostic imaging centers on acceptable terms, if at all. Further, we
may not be able to obtain future financing for new acquisitions on acceptable terms, if at all. Our inability to
complete acquisitions of additional outpatient diagnostic imaging centers could limit the overall growth of our
business.

**_We experience competition from other outpatient diagnostic imaging companies and hospitals, and this_**
**_competition could adversely affect our revenue and business._**

The market for outpatient diagnostic imaging services is highly competitive. We compete principally on the basis of
our reputation, our ability to provide multiple modalities at many of our centers, the location of our centers and the
quality of our outpatient diagnostic imaging services. We compete locally with groups of radiologists, established
hospitals, clinics and other independent organizations that own and operate imaging equipment. Our competitors


-----

include, among others: Radnet, Inc., Alliance Healthcare Services, Inc., SimonMed Imaging LLC and InSight
Health Services Corp. Some of our competitors may now or in the future have access to greater financial resources
than we do and may have access to newer, more advanced equipment. In addition, some physician practices have
established their own outpatient diagnostic imaging centers within their group practices and compete with us. We
are experiencing increased competition as a result of such activities, and if we are unable to successfully compete,
our business and financial condition would be adversely affected.

**_Our failure to integrate the businesses we acquire successfully and on a timely basis could reduce our_**
**_profitability._**

We may never realize expected synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects in connection with our
acquisitions. We may experience increased competition that limits our ability to expand our business. We may not
be able to capitalize on expected business opportunities, assumptions underlying estimates of expected cost savings
may be inaccurate, or general industry and business conditions may deteriorate. In addition, integrating operations
will require significant efforts and expenses on our part. Personnel may leave or be terminated because of an
acquisition. Our management may have its attention diverted while trying to integrate an acquisition. If these factors
limit our ability to integrate the operations of an acquisition successfully or on a timely basis, our expectations of
future results of operations, including certain cost savings and synergies as a result of the acquisition, may not be
met. In addition, our growth and operating strategies for a target’s business may be different from the strategies that
the target company pursued prior to our acquisition. If our strategies are not the proper strategies, it could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our ability to generate revenue depends in large part on referrals from physicians._**

A significant reduction in physician referrals would have a negative impact on our business. We derive substantially
all of our net revenue, directly or indirectly, from fees charged for the diagnostic imaging services performed at our
centers. We depend on referrals of patients from unaffiliated physicians and other third parties who have no
contractual obligations to refer patients to us for a substantial portion of the services we perform. If a sufficiently
large number of these physicians and other third parties were to discontinue referring patients to us, including in
connection with voluntary or involuntary closures of physician offices in connection with the current, ongoing
COVID-19 pandemic or the delay of other elective procedures for which our imaging services are required, our scan
volume could decrease, which would reduce our net revenue and operating margins. Further, commercial third-party
payors have implemented programs that could limit the ability of physicians to refer patients to us. For example,
prepaid healthcare plans, such as health maintenance organizations, sometimes contract directly with providers and
require their enrollees to obtain these services exclusively from those providers. Some insurance companies and
self-insured employers also limit these services to contracted providers. These “closed panel” systems are now
common in the managed care environment. Other systems create an economic disincentive for referrals to providers
outside the system’s designated panel of providers. If we are unable to compete successfully for these managed care
contracts, our results and prospects for growth could be adversely affected.

**_Pressure to control healthcare costs could have a negative impact on our results._**

One of the principal objectives of health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations is to
control the cost of healthcare services. Healthcare providers participating in managed care plans may be required to
refer diagnostic imaging tests to certain providers depending on the plan in which a covered patient is enrolled. In
addition, managed care contracting has become very competitive, and reimbursement schedules are at or below
Medicare reimbursement levels. The expansion of health maintenance organizations, preferred provider
organizations and other managed care organizations within the geographic areas covered by our network could have
a negative impact on the utilization and pricing of our services, because these organizations will exert greater control
over patients’ access to diagnostic imaging services, the selections of the provider of such services and
reimbursement rates for those services.

**_If our contracted radiology practices lose a significant number of radiologists, our financial results could be_**
**_adversely affected._**

At times, there has been a shortage of qualified radiologists in some of the regional markets we serve. In addition,
competition in recruiting radiologists may make it difficult for our contracted radiology practices to maintain


-----

adequate levels of radiologists. If a significant number of radiologists terminate their relationships with our
contracted radiology practices and those radiology practices cannot recruit sufficient qualified radiologists to fulfill
their obligations under our agreements with them, our ability to maximize the use of our outpatient diagnostic
imaging centers and our financial results could be adversely affected. Neither we, nor our contracted radiology
practices, maintain insurance on the lives of any affiliated physicians.

**_We may become subject to professional malpractice liability, which could be costly and negatively impact our_**
**_business._**

The physicians employed by our contracted radiology practices are from time to time subject to malpractice claims.
We structure our relationships with radiologists in a manner that we believe does not constitute the practice of
medicine by us or subject us to professional malpractice claims for acts or omissions of physicians employed by the
contracted radiology practices. Nevertheless, claims, suits or complaints relating to services provided by the
contracted radiology practices have been asserted against us in the past and may be asserted against us in the future.
In addition, we may be subject to professional liability claims, including, without limitation, for improper use or
malfunction of our outpatient diagnostic imaging equipment or for accidental contamination or injury from exposure
to radiation. We may not be able to maintain adequate liability insurance to protect us against those claims at
acceptable costs or at all.

Any claim made against us that is not fully covered by insurance could be costly to defend, result in a substantial
damage award against us and divert the attention of our management from our operations, all of which could have
an adverse effect on our financial performance. In addition, successful claims against us may adversely affect our
business or reputation.

**_We may not be able to enforce claims with respect to the representations, warranties and indemnities that the_**
**_sellers of any diagnostic imaging center we acquire have provided to us under the respective purchase_**
**_agreements._**

In connection with our acquisitions, the sellers have given certain representations, warranties and indemnities. There
can be no assurance that we will be able to enforce any claims against those sellers’ breaches of such
representations, warranties or indemnities. The sellers’ liability with respect to breaches of such representations and
warranties and indemnities under the respective purchase agreement may be limited. Even if we ultimately succeed
in recovering any amounts, we may temporarily be required to bear these losses ourselves.

**_We may not be able to secure additional financing which may impair our ability to complete future acquisitions._**

There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise the additional funding that we will need to carry out our
business objectives and to complete outpatient diagnostic imaging center acquisitions. The development of our
business depends upon prevailing capital market conditions, our business performance and our ability to obtain
financing through debt financing, equity financing or other means. There is no assurance that we will be successful
in obtaining the financing we require as and when needed or at all in order to complete future acquisitions.

**_We do not independently own all of our outpatient diagnostic imaging centers._**

Healthcare laws and regulations in the United States may impact our ability to operate or own our outpatient
diagnostic imaging centers, thereby necessitating the use of partnerships, joint ventures and other management
services frameworks. The Company may be required to deal with such diverse operating or ownership frameworks.
In addition, from time to time, the Company may decide to use cash to restructure its arrangements with fellow
owners, managers or operators.

**_We may engage in litigation with our partners and contractors._**

The nature of our relationships with our partners and contractors may give rise to litigation or disputes. In the
ordinary course of business, we are the subject of complaints or litigation. We may also engage in future litigation to
enforce the terms of our agreements and compliance with our brand standards as determined necessary to protect our
brand, the consistency of our services and the consumer experience. Engaging in such litigation may be costly and
time-consuming and may distract management and materially adversely affect our relationships with our partners


-----

and contractors or potential partners and contractors and our ability to attract new partners and contractors. Any
negative outcome of these or any other claims could materially adversely affect our results of operations, as well as
our ability to increase our number of partners and contractors and may damage our reputation and brand.
Furthermore, existing and future legislation could subject us to additional litigation risk in the event we are required
by such legislation to terminate or fail to renew a partner or contractor or not succeed in revising the contracts
related to such relationships to comply with changes to legislation.

**_The regulatory framework in which we operate is uncertain and evolving._**

Healthcare laws and regulations may change significantly in the future. We continuously monitor these
developments and modify our operations from time to time as the regulatory environment changes. We cannot
assure you, however, that we will be able to adapt our operations to address new regulations or that new regulations
will not adversely affect our business. Although we believe that we are operating in compliance with applicable
federal and state laws, we cannot assure you that a review of our business by courts or regulatory authorities will not
result in a determination that could adversely affect our operations or that the healthcare regulatory environment will
not change in a way that restricts our operations. Certain states have enacted statutes or adopted regulations affecting
risk assumption in the healthcare industry, including statutes and regulations that subject any physician or physician
network engaged in risk-based managed care contracting to applicable insurance laws and regulations. These laws
and regulations, if adopted in the states in which we operate, may require physicians and physician networks to meet
minimum capital requirements and other safety and soundness requirements. Implementing additional regulations or
compliance requirements could result in substantial costs to us and the contracted radiology practices and limit our
ability to enter into risk-sharing managed care arrangements.

**_Failure to structure our operations in compliance with federal and state regulations, including anti-kickback,_**
**_self-referral, false claims or other fraud and abuse laws, could result in substantial penalties._**

We are directly or indirectly through the radiology practices with which we contract subject to extensive regulation
by both the federal government and the state governments in which we and/or they provide services. These laws
may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we conduct our operations,
including our sales and marketing practices with referring physicians and our contractual arrangements with
physicians and radiologists. Such laws include, without limitation:

    - the U.S. federal civil and criminal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons
or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing any remuneration,
directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either
the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good, facility,
item or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under U.S. federal and state
healthcare programs such as Medicare, state Medicaid programs and TRICARE. A person or entity
does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have
committed a violation;

    - the federal physician self-referral prohibition, commonly known as the Stark Law, which, in the
absence of an applicable exception, prohibits a physician from making a referral for certain designated
health services covered by the Medicare or Medicaid program, including diagnostic imaging services,
if the physician or an immediate family member of the physician has a financial relationship with the
entity providing the designated health services. The Stark Law also prohibits the entity furnishing the
designated health services from billing, presenting or causing to be presented a claim for the
designated health services furnished pursuant to the prohibited referral;

    - the federal false claims laws, including the False Claims Act, which can be enforced through
whistleblower actions, and civil monetary penalties laws, which, among other things, impose criminal
and civil penalties against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented,
to the U.S. federal government, claims for payment or approval that are false or fraudulent, knowingly
making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or
fraudulent claim, or from knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an
obligation to pay money to the U.S. federal government. In addition, the government may assert that a
claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute


-----

or the Stark Law constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act; Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil
liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a
scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or
covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement, in connection with the delivery
of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback
Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to
violate it in order to have committed a violation;

    - HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or
HITECH, and its implementing regulations, which also imposes certain obligations, including
mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of
individually identifiable health information by covered entities, such as health plans, healthcare
clearinghouses and healthcare providers, as well as their business associates that perform certain
services involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information; state law
equivalents of each of the above federal laws, including state anti-kickback, self-referral and false
claims laws that apply more broadly to healthcare items or services paid by all payors, including selfpay patients and private insurers, that govern our interactions with patients or restrict payments that
may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources;

    - state laws that prohibit the practice of medicine by non-physicians and prohibit fee-splitting
arrangements involving physicians;

    - laws relating to practitioner and provider licensure;

    - laws relating to medical malpractice;

    - federal and state billing and claims submission and other insurance laws and regulations;

    - federal and state laws governing the diagnostic imaging and therapeutic equipment we use in our
business concerning patient safety, equipment operating specifications and radiation exposure levels;
and

    - state laws governing reimbursement for diagnostic services related to services compensable under
workers compensation rules.

Our sales and marketing practices with physicians and physician and other financial relationships within the Akumin
organization, including amounts paid under our management services agreements, interpretation services agreements
and all other financial arrangements involving Akumin, its intermediaries and potential referral sources or recipients
may, notwithstanding our policies and procedures otherwise, result in violations of these laws. Our financial
arrangements and our sales and marketing practice have been subject to regulatory scrutiny in the past and could be
in the future. While our management services agreements, services agreements and operational policies and
procedures, including our compliance program, mandate compliance with applicable law, we cannot assure you that
we will be successful in preventing our contractors, employees or other agents from taking actions in violation of
these laws or regulations or that we will not otherwise be deemed to have failed to comply with such laws.

If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws and regulations to which we or the radiology
practices with which we contract are subject, we may be subject to the applicable penalty associated with the
violation, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines and the curtailment of our operations. Any penalties,
damages, fines or curtailment of our operations, individually or in the aggregate, could adversely affect our ability to
operate our business and our financial results. The risks of our being found in violation of these laws and regulations
is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts,
their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations and such laws and regulations may apply to businesses
acquired from time to time by Akumin, in addition to Akumin’s business.


-----

**_We could be subject to increased monetary penalties and other sanctions, including exclusion from federal_**
**_healthcare programs, if we fail to comply with the terms of applicable corporate integrity agreements._**

Prior to our acquisition of Akumin Texas (as defined below), Preferred Imaging Centers, LLC (“PIC”), then a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Akumin Texas which was merged into Akumin Texas effective September 30, 2017,
was the subject of an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) premised upon an allegation that
PIC and its affiliates violated U.S. federal law by performing and billing for certain imaging services without on-site
physician supervision. In or about June, 2016, PIC entered into a no-fault settlement agreement with the DOJ with
respect to those allegations, which included PIC paying $3.5 million to the U.S. government and entering into a
corporate integrity agreement (“CIA”) with the Office of the Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services. PIC’s CIA expires June 29, 2021.

Also, prior to our acquisition of the imaging centers operated by Rose Radiology, Rose Radiology (through its
predecessor, Rose Radiology Centers, Inc.) was the subject of an investigation by the DOJ premised upon
allegations that Rose Radiology violated the False Claims Act for billing Medicare and other federal programs for
ineligible procedures and certain other healthcare laws. Upon our acquisition of Rose Radiology’s assets, Rose
Radiology, a physician-owned radiology practice, retained Akumin as its manager for administrative and other nonclinical matters. In or about December, 2015, Rose Radiology entered into a no-fault settlement agreement with the
DOJ with respect to those allegations which included Rose Radiology paying $8.7 million to the U.S. government
and entering into a CIA. Rose Radiology’s CIA expires December 29, 2020.

Material, uncorrected violations of the CIA could lead to our exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid
and other federal and state healthcare programs. In addition, we are subject to possible civil penalties for failure to
substantially comply with the terms of the CIA, including stipulated penalties ranging between $1,000 and $2,500
per day. We are also subject to a stipulated penalty of $50,000 for each false certification made by us or on our
behalf, pursuant to the reporting provisions of the CIA. The CIA increases the amount of information we must
provide to the federal government regarding our practices at our healthcare facilities and our compliance with
federal regulations. The reports we provide in connection with the CIA could result in greater scrutiny by other
regulatory agencies.

Given the broad powers of the DOJ and other federal agencies, there can be no assurance that the obligations of
Akumin Texas and Rose Radiology pursuant to their respective CIAs, or otherwise, will not be expanded to cover
all or a greater portion of Akumin’s operations. Any action brought against us for violation of these laws or
regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, suffer
reputational harm and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business.

**_We may from time to time become the subject of legal, regulatory and governmental proceedings that, if resolved_**
**_unfavorably, could have an adverse effect on us, and we may be subject to other loss contingencies, both known_**
**_and unknown._**

We may from time to time become a party to various legal, regulatory and governmental proceedings and other
related matters. Those proceedings include, among other things, governmental investigations and lawsuits brought
against us by third parties. In addition, we may become subject to other loss contingencies, both known and
unknown, which may relate to past, present and future facts, events, circumstances and occurrences. Addressing any
investigations, lawsuits or other claims may distract management and divert resources, even if we ultimately prevail.
Should an unfavorable outcome occur in some or all of any such current or future legal, regulatory or governmental
proceedings or other such loss contingencies, or if successful claims and other actions are brought against us in the
future, there could be an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

The healthcare industry has seen numerous ongoing investigations related to compliance, supervision and billing
practices. From time to time, we detect issues of non-compliance with federal healthcare laws pertaining to claims
submission and reimbursement payment practices, including compliance with supervision requirements, or financial
relationships with physicians. We avail ourselves of various mechanisms to address potential overpayments arising
out of these issues, including repayment of claims, rebilling of claims, and participation in voluntary disclosure
protocols offered by CMS and the OIG. Under the federal False Claims Act, private parties have the right to bring
qui tam, or “whistleblower,” suits against healthcare facilities that submit false claims for payments to, or
improperly retain overpayments from, governmental payors. Some states have adopted similar state whistleblower


-----

and false claims provisions. Qui tam or “whistleblower” actions initiated under the civil False Claims Act may be
pending but placed under seal by the court to comply with the False Claims Act’s requirements for filing such suits.
As a result, they could lead to proceedings without our knowledge. Certain of our facilities and radiology practices
have received and may receive, inquiries, civil investigative demands, or subpoenas from federal and state agencies.
Governmental investigations, as well as qui tam lawsuits, may lead to significant fines, penalties, settlements or
other sanctions, including exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs. We have been subject to civil
investigative demands and investigations from time to time regarding our compliance with physician supervision
requirements for MRI procedures and other diagnostic imaging tests as well as our sales and marketing practices and
financial arrangements with physicians. Settlements of lawsuits involving Medicare and Medicaid issues routinely
require both monetary payments and corporate integrity agreements, each of which could have an adverse effect on
our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

**_Federal and state privacy and information security laws are complex, and if we fail to comply with applicable_**
**_laws, regulations and standards, or if we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data, protect our_**
**_proprietary rights to our systems, or defend against cybersecurity attacks, we may be subject to government or_**
**_private actions due to privacy and security breaches, and our business, reputation, results of operations, financial_**
**_position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected._**

We must comply with numerous federal and state laws and regulations governing the collection, dissemination,
access, use, security and privacy of personally identifiable information and protected health information, including
HIPAA, state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, federal and state consumer
protection laws and regulations and other data protection laws. New privacy legislation may create additional rights
for consumers and impose additional requirements on businesses. As these laws and regulations increase in
complexity and number, they may change frequently, sometimes conflict and increase our compliance efforts, costs
and risks. If we fail to comply with applicable privacy and security laws, regulations and standards, properly
maintain the integrity of our data, protect our proprietary rights to our systems, or defend against cybersecurity
attacks, our business, reputation, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and
adversely affected.

HIPAA establishes a set of national privacy and security standards for the protection of protected health information,
or PHI, by health plans, health care clearinghouses and certain health care providers, or “covered entities,” and their
“business associates,” which are persons or entities that perform certain services for, or on behalf of, a covered
entity that involve creating, receiving, maintaining or transmitting PHI. We are a covered entity under HIPAA and
therefore must comply with its requirements to protect the privacy and security of health information and must
provide individuals with certain rights with respect to their health information. If we engage a business associate to
assist us in carrying out our health care operations, we must have a written business associate contract or other
arrangement with the business associate that establishes specifically what the business associate has been engaged to
do and requires the business associate to comply with the same requirements.

Penalties for violations of these laws vary. For instance, a single breach incident can result in findings of violations
of multiple HIPAA provisions. Penalties for failure to comply with a requirement of HIPAA vary significantly, and
include civil monetary penalties for each provision of HIPAA that is violated and, in certain circumstances, criminal
penalties, including imprisonment and/or additional fines. A person who knowingly obtains or discloses individually
identifiable health information in violation of HIPAA may face additional fines and up to one-year imprisonment.
The criminal penalties increase if the wrongful conduct involves false pretenses or the intent to sell, transfer, or use
identifiable health information for commercial advantage, personal gain, or malicious harm. We have from time to
time been subject to investigations by the Office for Civil Rights with respect to our HIPAA compliance.
Responding to government investigations regarding alleged violations of these and other laws and regulations, even
if ultimately concluded with no findings of violations or no penalties imposed, can consume company resources and
impact our business and, if public, harm our reputation. State attorneys general also have the right to prosecute
HIPAA violations committed against residents of their states. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action
that would allow individuals to sue in civil court for HIPAA violations, its standards have been used as the basis for
the duty of care in state civil suits, such as those for negligence or recklessness in misusing individuals’ health
information.

Even when HIPAA does not apply, according to the Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, failing to take
appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure may constitute unfair acts or practices in or


-----

affecting commerce in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The FTC expects a company’s data security
measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds,
the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities.
Individually identifiable health information is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards.

Certain states have also adopted comparable privacy and security laws and regulations, some of which may be more
stringent than HIPAA. Such laws and regulations will be subject to interpretation by various courts and other
governmental authorities, thus creating potentially complex compliance issues for us. Further, California enacted the
California Consumer Privacy Act, or the CCPA, on June 28, 2018, which went into effect on January 1, 2020. The
CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain
personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The
CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected
to increase data breach litigation. Although there are limited exemptions for health-related information, including
PHI maintained by a covered entity or a business associate, the CCPA may increase our compliance costs and
potential liability. Some observers have noted that the CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more
stringent privacy legislation in the United States, which could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our
business. Similar laws have been proposed in other states and at the federal level, and if passed, such laws may have
potentially conflicting requirements that would make compliance challenging.

Compliance with applicable data privacy and security laws, rules and regulations could require us to engage in
costly compliance exercises, restrict our ability to collect, or use and disclose data. Each of these constantly evolving
laws can be subject to varying interpretations. Failure to comply with U.S. data protection laws and regulations
could result in government investigations and enforcement actions (which could include civil or criminal penalties),
fines, private litigation, and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business.
Moreover, patients about whom we obtain information may contractually limit our ability to use and disclose the
information. Claims that we have violated individuals’ privacy rights, failed to comply with data protection laws, or
breached our contractual obligations, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time-consuming to
defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business.

**_Our internal computer systems, or those used by any of our third-party service providers, may fail or suffer_**
**_security breaches, which may adversely affect our business, operations and financial performance._**

Information security risks have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new
technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct our operations, and the
increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists and other external parties, including
foreign state agents. Our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential,
proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks.

Despite the implementation of security measures, our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party service
providers may be vulnerable to privacy and security incidents, cyberattacks, acts of vandalism or theft, computer
viruses, coordinated attacks by activist entities, emerging cybersecurity risks, misplaced or lost data, programming
and/or human errors, or other similar events that could result in unauthorized access to, use or disclosure of,
corruption of, or loss of sensitive and/or proprietary data, including personal information or PHI. Emerging and
advanced security threats, including coordinated attacks, require additional layers of security which may disrupt or
impact efficiency of operations. Attacks upon information technology systems are increasing in their frequency,
levels of persistence, sophistication and intensity, and are being conducted by sophisticated and organized groups
and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may also
face increased cybersecurity risks due to our reliance on internet technology and the number of our employees who
are working remotely, which may create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities.
Furthermore, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or to sabotage, systems change
frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these
techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. We may also experience security breaches that may
remain undetected for an extended period. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it
could result in a material disruption of our business operations. In addition, such a breach may require notification to
governmental agencies, the media or individuals pursuant to various federal and state privacy and security laws, if
applicable, including HIPAA, as well as regulations promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission and state breach
notification laws. We would also be exposed to a risk of loss, including financial assets or litigation and potential


-----

liability, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or
applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability.

Our insurance policies may not be adequate to compensate us for the potential losses arising from such disruptions,
failure, or security breach. In addition, such insurance may not be available to us in the future on economically
reasonable terms, or at all. Further, our insurance may not cover all claims made against us and defending a suit,
regardless of its merit, could be costly, divert management attention, and harm our reputation.

**_We may not receive payment from some of our healthcare provider customers because of their financial_**
**_circumstances or other contractual or legal disputes._**

Some of our healthcare provider customers do not have significant financial resources, liquidity or access to capital.
If these customers experience financial difficulties or if there arises a contractual or other legal dispute to which they
are party, they may be unable to pay us for the equipment and services that we provide. A significant deterioration in
general or local economic conditions, including in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material
adverse effect on the financial health of certain of our healthcare provider customers. As a result, we may have to
increase the amounts of accounts receivable that we write-off, which would adversely affect our financial condition
and results of operations.

**_We have significant liabilities which require us to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in order to_**
**_make mandated payments of principal and interest._**

We have incurred significant liabilities in connection with the acquisition of our current medical imaging centers.
Our ability to repay these liabilities will be contingent upon our success in achieving sufficient revenues from these
medical imaging centers to be able to make payments of principal and interest against this debt when due and
payable. There is no assurance that we will be able to secure future additional financing to repay our current credit
facilities should cash flows from operations be insufficient to repay these liabilities. Our inability to repay
outstanding debt when due would have a material adverse impact on our business.

**_We face liquidity risks and may encounter difficulty raising funds to meet our financial commitments._**

We are exposed to liquidity risk mainly with respect to our credit facilities. Although the Company seeks to ensure
that there is sufficient liquidity to meet its short-term business requirements, taking into account its anticipated cash
flows from operations and its holdings of cash, there is no assurance sufficient liquidity is maintained. If our actual
cash flows from operations differ significantly from our anticipated cash flows for these purposes, such as a result of
the COVID-19 pandemic, we may have insufficient liquidity to meet our financial commitments.

**_The effect of the uncertainty relating to potential future changes to U.S. healthcare laws may increase our and_**
**_our partners’ and contractors’ healthcare costs, limit the ability of patients to obtain health insurance, increase_**
**_patients’ share of health care costs and negatively impact our financial results._**

Healthcare systems are subject to ongoing legislative and regulatory reform in the United States and abroad, and
certain of these proposals may affect reimbursement, coverage, and utilization of diagnostic imaging services. For
example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education
Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “ACA”) was signed into law, which substantially changed the way
healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States.

Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional efforts to modify or repeal the ACA. For example,
the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision that entered into effect on January 1, 2019, that repealed the
tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying
health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” In December
2018, a U.S. district court held that the individual mandate was unconstitutional, which was upheld by the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The Supreme Court of the United States granted certiorari on March 2, 2020,
and the case is expected to be decided by mid-2021.


-----

In addition, there have been other legislative changes proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was
enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, resulted in reductions in payments to
Medicare providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative
amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from
May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, the
American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced CMS payments to several providers, including
hospitals, further increased the presumed utilization of advanced diagnostic imaging services to a presumed rate of
90%, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover Medicare overpayments to
providers from three to five years.

We cannot predict which healthcare reform measures will be implemented or the full impact of current or future
healthcare reform measures on our business. While we are unable to predict what, if any, changes may ultimately be
enacted, the U.S. Congressional Budget Office and others have estimated that some of the proposals made to date
would result in millions of additional uninsured patients in the U.S. Additionally, U.S. lawmakers have suggested
that, even if no formal legislation repealing or modifying the ACA is passed, they may take, or omit, actions that
could adversely impact the viability of the ACA and the health insurance markets, which could result in more
uninsured patients, other patients having lesser coverage or patients having to absorb a greater portion of the cost of
their health care services. Any such changes or any other future changes in the manner in which health care services
in the U.S. are paid for and reimbursed by government and private payors could adversely impact our business.

**_Because of our U.S. operations, we could be adversely affected by violations of anti-bribery laws._**

Almost all of our operations are located outside of Canada. Anti-bribery laws and regulations generally prohibit
companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-resident officers, employees or any
other persons acting in an official capacity for any government entity to any political party or official thereof or to
any candidate for political office for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our management services
agreements, services agreements and operational policies and procedures, including our compliance program,
mandate compliance with applicable law, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in preventing our
contractors, employees or other agents from taking actions in violation of these laws or regulations or that we will
not otherwise be deemed to have failed to comply with such laws. Such violations, or allegations of such violations,
could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and
cash flows.

**_We operate outpatient diagnostic imaging centers in some regions which are exposed to natural disasters, public_**
**_health epidemics and other calamities._**

Our outpatient diagnostic imaging centers are located in regions which are vulnerable to a variety of natural
disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes, flooding, wild fires, etc. We cannot ensure that our centers in these
markets would survive a future hurricane, earthquake, flood, wild fire or other natural disaster. Similarly, we cannot
ensure that we will be able to procure insurance for such losses in meaningful amounts or at affordable rates in the
future. If a natural disaster or other event with a significant economic impact occurs in a region where we operate,
such disaster or event could negatively affect the profitability of our business. A local, regional, national or
international outbreak of a contagious disease, including the novel coronavirus known as COVID-19, Middle East
Respiratory Syndrome, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, H1N1 influenza virus, avian flu or any other similar
illness, or a fear of any of the foregoing, and changes to laws and other government actions implemented in response
to such an illness, could decrease the willingness or ability of customers to patronize our centers, cause shortages of
employees to staff our centers, interrupt certain supplies from third parties upon which the Company relies, restrict
our ability to offer certain services and otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business,
financial condition and results of operations. Such adverse effect could be rapid and unexpected and it is unknown
whether and how the Company may be affected if such an epidemic persists for an extended period of time.

**_We may be unsuccessful in evaluating material risks involved in completed and future investments which could_**
**_impact our ability to realize the expected benefits from future investments and acquisitions._**

We regularly review investment opportunities and, as part of the review, conduct business, legal and financial due
diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in any particular transaction. Despite
our efforts, we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks. In particular, financial insight into


-----

our previously acquired companies or financial due diligence in respect of potential targets may be limited in light of
the availability of financial information. As a result, we may not realize the intended advantages of any given
investment and may not identify all of the risks relating to the investment. If we fail to realize the expected benefits
from one or more investments, or do not identify all of the risks associated with a particular investment, our
business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.

**_We may be subject to certain regulations that could restrict our activities and abilities to generate revenues as_**
**_planned._**

From time to time, governments, government agencies and industry self-regulatory bodies in Canada, the United
States, and other countries in which we will operate have adopted statutes, regulations and rulings that directly or
indirectly affect the activities of our company and our future clients. These regulations could adversely impact on
our ability to execute our business strategy and generate revenues as planned.

**_Technological change in our industry could reduce the demand for our services and require us to incur_**
**_significant costs to upgrade our equipment._**

The development of new technologies or refinements of existing modalities may require us to upgrade and enhance
our existing equipment before we may otherwise intend. Many companies currently manufacture diagnostic imaging
equipment. Competition among manufacturers for a greater share of the diagnostic imaging equipment market may
result in technological advances in the speed and imaging capacity of new equipment. This may accelerate the
obsolescence of our equipment, and we may not have the financial ability to acquire the new or improved equipment
and may not be able to maintain a competitive equipment base. In addition, advances in technology may enable
physicians and others to perform diagnostic imaging procedures without us. If we are unable to deliver our services
in the efficient and effective manner that payors, physicians and patients expect, our revenue could substantially
decrease.

**_Because we have high fixed costs, lower scan volumes per system could adversely affect our business._**

The principal components of our expenses, excluding depreciation, consist of debt service, finance lease payments,
compensation paid to technologists, salaries, real estate lease expenses and equipment maintenance costs. Because a
majority of these expenses are fixed, a relatively small change in our revenue could have a disproportionate effect on
our operating and financial results depending on the source of our revenue. Thus, decreased revenue as a result of
lower scan volumes per system could result in lower margins, which could materially adversely affect our business.

**_We may be unable to effectively maintain our equipment or generate revenue when our equipment is not_**
**_operational._**

Timely, effective service is essential to maintaining our reputation and high use rates on our imaging equipment.
Although we have an agreement with a third party equipment service provider pursuant to which such service
provider maintains and repairs the majority of our imaging equipment, the agreement does not compensate us for
loss of revenue when our systems are not fully operational and our business interruption insurance may not provide
sufficient coverage for the loss of revenue. Also, third party equipment service providers may not be able to perform
repairs or supply needed parts in a timely manner, which could result in a loss of revenue. Therefore, if we
experience more equipment malfunctions than anticipated or if we are unable to promptly obtain the service
necessary to keep our equipment functioning effectively, or where our business or data is compromised on account
of equipment malfunctions or a cybersecurity-related attack, our ability to provide services and to fulfill our
contractual arrangements would be adversely affected and our revenue could decline.

**_Our inability to attract and retain qualified radiology technologists and key managerial and other non-medical_**
**_personnel may adversely impact our ability to carry out our business operations and strategies as planned._**

We are highly dependent on qualified managerial personnel. Our anticipated growth will require additional expertise
and the addition of new qualified personnel. There is intense competition for qualified personnel in the radiology
and medical imaging field. Therefore, we may not be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for
the development of our business. The loss of the services of existing personnel, as well as the failure to recruit
additional key managerial personnel in a timely manner, would harm our business development programs and ability


-----

to manage day-to-day operations, attract collaboration partners, attract and retain other employees and generate
revenues. We may not maintain key personal life insurance on any of our employees.

**_Our policies regarding allowances for doubtful accounts may negatively impact our financial results in future_**
**_fiscal periods._**

We cannot ensure that our allowances for doubtful accounts will not exceed the estimates, which could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.

**_Market rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations._**

We may be subject to market risk through the risk of loss of value in our portfolios resulting from changes in interest
rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, and equity prices. We are required to mark to market our
held-for-trading investments at the end of each reporting period, to the extent we own any such investments. This
process could result in significant write-downs of our investments over one or more reporting periods, particularly
during periods of overall market instability, including the extreme market volatility in connection with the current
COVID-19 pandemic, which could have a significant unfavorable effect on our financial position.

**_Some of our imaging modalities use radioactive materials which generate regulated waste and could subject us to_**
**_liabilities for injuries or violations of environmental and health and safety laws._**

Some of our imaging procedures use radioactive materials which generate medical and other regulated wastes. For
example, patients are injected with a radioactive substance before undergoing a PET scan. Storage, use and disposal
of these materials and waste products present the risk of accidental environmental contamination and physical
injury. We are subject to federal, state and local regulations governing storage, handling and disposal of these
materials. We could incur significant costs and the diversion of our management’s attention in order to comply with
current or future environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. Also, we cannot completely eliminate
the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these hazardous materials. Although we believe that we maintain
liability insurance coverage consistent with industry practice in the event of an accident, we could be held liable for
any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed the limits of or fall outside the coverage of our liability
insurance.

**_Our inability to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could increase the risk of an error in_**
**_our financial statements._**

Our senior management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial
reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with IFRS. Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving
financial reporting objectives due to its inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that
involves human diligence and compliance and is therefore subject to error, collusion, or improper override. Given
such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis, and
although it is possible to incorporate into the financial reporting process safeguards to reduce this risk, they cannot
be guaranteed to entirely eliminate it. If we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, then
there is an increased risk of an error in our financial statements that could result in us being required to restate
previously issued financial statements at a later date.

**_If we fail to comply with various licensure, certification and accreditation standards, we may be subject to loss of_**
**_licensure, certification or accreditation, which would adversely affect our operations._**

Ownership, construction, operation, expansion and acquisition of our outpatient diagnostic imaging centers are
subject to various federal and state laws, regulations and approvals concerning licensing of personnel, other required
certificates for certain types of healthcare facilities and certain medical equipment. In addition, freestanding
diagnostic imaging centers that provide services independent of a physician’s office must be enrolled by Medicare
as an independent diagnostic treatment facility, or IDTF, to bill the Medicare program. Medicare carriers have
discretion in applying the IDTF requirements and therefore the application of these requirements may vary from
jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In addition, federal legislation requires all suppliers that provide the technical component


-----

of diagnostic MRI, PET/CT, CT, and nuclear medicine to be accredited by an accreditation organization designated
by CMS (as defined below) (which currently includes the American College of Radiology (“ACR”), the
Intersocietal Accreditation Commission, RadSite and the Joint Commission). Our MRI, CT, mammography and
other diagnostic equipment are accredited as necessary by RadSite, ACR, IAC, The Joint Commission or other
recognized accreditation bodies. We may not be able to receive the required regulatory approvals or accreditation for
any future acquisitions, expansions or replacements, and the failure to obtain these approvals could limit the
opportunity to expand our services.

Our centers are subject to periodic inspection by governmental and other authorities to assure continued compliance
with the various standards necessary for licensure and certification. If any facility loses its certification under the
Medicare program, then the facility will be ineligible to receive reimbursement from the Medicare and Medicaid
programs. For Fiscal 2019, approximately 14% of our revenue came from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A
change in the applicable certification status of one of our centers could adversely affect our other centers and in turn
us as a whole.

In addition to licensure and certification at the facility level, the radiologists providing professional medical services
at our facilities are subject to licensing and related regulations by the states in which they provide services. As a
result, we require the radiology groups with which we contract to require those radiologists to have and maintain
appropriate licensure. Further, credentialing of physicians is required by our payors prior to commencing payment.
We have experienced a slowdown in the credentialing of our physicians over the last several years which has
lengthened our billing and collection cycle and could negatively impact our ability to collect revenue from patients
covered by Medicare.

**_Our management services arrangements with radiology practices and our professional services agreements with_**
**_contracted radiologists or radiology practices must be structured in compliance with laws relating to the practice_**
**_of medicine, including, without limitation, fee-splitting prohibitions._**

State laws in certain of the states in which we operate prohibit us from owning radiology practices, from exercising
control over the clinical judgment of physicians and/or from engaging in certain financial arrangements, such as
splitting professional fees with physicians. These laws vary by state and are enforced by state courts and regulatory
authorities, each with broad discretion, and often with limited precedent as to how challenges under these laws may
turn out. A component of our business has been to enter into management services agreements with radiology
practices. We provide management, administrative, technical and other non-medical services to the radiology
practices in exchange for a service fee typically based on a percentage of the practice’s revenue. We structure our
relationships with these radiology practices, including those managed following an acquisition by us of their nonclinical assets, in a manner that we believe keeps us from engaging in the practice of medicine or exercising control
over the medical judgments or decisions of the radiology practices or their physicians, or violating prohibitions
against fee-splitting. There can be no assurance that our present arrangements with physicians providing medical
services and medical supervision at our owned or managed diagnostic imaging centers will not be challenged, and, if
challenged, that they will not be found to violate applicable laws, thus subjecting us to potential damages, injunction
and/or civil and criminal penalties or require us to restructure our arrangements in a way that would affect the
control or quality of our services and/or change the amounts we receive from the operation of these centers and
locations. Any of these results could jeopardize our business. We have structured the fees payable to our subsidiaries
by our affiliated practice groups in such a manner that we believe complies with applicable federal, state and local
laws. Although the relevant laws have been subject to limited judicial and regulatory interpretation, we believe that
we are in compliance with applicable state laws in relation to the corporate practice of medicine. However,
regulatory authorities or other parties may assert that despite these management arrangements between our
subsidiaries and affiliated physician groups, we or our manager subsidiaries are engaged in the corporate practice of
medicine or that the contractual arrangements with the affiliated physician groups constitute unlawful fee splitting or
another violation of corporate practice of medicine rules. Should such an event occur, we or our affiliated physician
groups could be subject to administrative, civil or criminal remedies or penalties, our management services contracts
could be found to be legally invalid and unenforceable, in whole or in part, or we could be required to restructure
our contractual arrangements with our affiliated physician groups.


-----

**_Recently enacted and future federal legislation, regulatory changes or payment changes implemented by_**
**_commercial payors could limit the prices we can charge for our services and/or the amount we are reimbursed for_**
**_our services, which would reduce our revenue and adversely affect our operating results._**

Our revenue is derived from a diverse mix of third-party payors, including private payors, managed care capitated
payors and government payors. We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from direct billings to governmental
healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and private health insurance companies and/or health plans,
including but not limited to those participating in the Medicare Advantage program. For services for which we bill
Medicare directly or indirectly, including through contracted radiologists, we are paid under the Medicare Physician
Fee Schedule. Because governmental healthcare programs generally reimburse on a fee schedule basis rather than on
a charge-related basis, we generally cannot increase our revenues from these programs by increasing the amount of
charges for services. Any negative changes in governmental capitation or fee-for-service rates or methods of
reimbursement for the services we provide could have a significant adverse impact on our revenue and financial
results.

Generally, commercial insurance companies reimburse us, directly or indirectly, including through the contracted
radiology groups elsewhere, on the basis of agreed upon rates. These rates are negotiated and may differ materially
with rates set forth in the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule for the particular service. The patients may be
responsible for certain co-payments or deductibles.

Government and private payors have taken and may continue to take steps to control the cost, eligibility for, use, and
delivery of healthcare services, including diagnostic imaging services, as a result of budgetary constraints, cost
containment pressures and other reasons. For example, reimbursement by government payors for a number of
diagnostic imaging procedures, including many that we or our managed radiology practices perform, has been
materially reduced over the last number of years. Certain private payors have followed suit and reduced
reimbursement for certain diagnostic imaging procedures. Given the recent history, we expect that reimbursement
for certain diagnostic imaging services that we or our managed radiology practices provide, may be reduced in the
future, which would adversely impact our business. Additionally, CMS and other payors are seeking to shift from a
primarily fee for service reimbursement paradigm to a more value based model. We cannot predict what such
changes will ultimately look like or how they may ultimately impact our business or financial performance, which
creates significant uncertainty for our business.

**_There may be gaps in our insurance coverage relating to events which transpired prior to our acquisition of our_**
**_centers in Pennsylvania and Delaware._**

When we acquired the assets of our centers in Pennsylvania and Delaware on April 21, 2016, we also agreed to
indemnify the physician-owned radiology practices which serviced those centers pursuant to management services
agreements with those entities. The Company has not insured against risks which pre-date its acquisition of those
centers and, as a result, it could be liable, without the benefit of insurance proceeds, for damages suffered as a result
of complaints or other proceedings against those physician-owned radiology practices relating to events which
transpired prior to April 21, 2016. These complaints could include actions for medical malpractice or wrongful
death.

**_We incur expenses as a result of being a public company and our current resources may not be sufficient to_**
**_fulfill our public company obligations._**

We incur significant legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses as a result of being a public company, which
may negatively impact our performance and could cause our results of operations and financial condition to suffer.
Compliance with applicable securities laws in Canada and the U.S. and the rules of the Toronto Stock Exchange (the
“TSX”) and The Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) substantially increases our expenses, including our legal and
accounting costs, and makes some activities more time-consuming and costly. Reporting obligations as a public
company and our anticipated growth may place a strain on our financial and management systems, processes and
controls, as well as our personnel.

We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, which is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with IFRS. Because of our inherent limitations and the


-----

fact that we are a public company and are implementing additional financial control and management systems,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. A failure to prevent or
detect errors or misstatements may result in a material impact on our financial position, liquidity, and results of
operations.

If our management is unable to certify the effectiveness of our internal controls or if material weaknesses in our
internal controls are identified, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence, which
could have a material impact on our financial position, liquidity, and results of operations. In addition, if we do not
maintain adequate financial and management personnel, processes and controls, we may not be able to accurately
report our financial performance on a timely basis, which could have a material impact on our financial position,
liquidity, and results of operations.

We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting will
prevent all error or fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and implemented, can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control
system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered
relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide
absolute assurance that all control issues within an organization are detected. The inherent limitations include the
realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or
mistakes. Controls can also be circumvented by individual acts of certain persons, by collusion of two or more
people or by management override of the controls. Due to the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system,
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected in a timely manner or at all. If we cannot
provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results could be materially adversely
effected, which could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which in turn
could have a material impact on our financial position, liquidity and results of operations.

**_Our senior management team has limited experience managing a public company, and regulatory compliance_**
**_may divert its attention from the day-to-day management of our business._**

We are publicly listed on the TSX and have recently listed on Nasdaq. The individuals who now constitute our
senior management team have relatively limited experience managing a publicly traded company and limited
experience complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies compared to senior
management of other publicly traded companies. Our senior management team may not successfully or efficiently
manage a public company subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under Canadian and
U.S. securities laws. In particular, these new obligations will require substantial attention from our senior
management and could divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of our business.

**_The forward-looking statements contained in this offering memorandum may prove to be incorrect._**

There can be no assurance that any estimates and assumptions contained in this offering memorandum will prove to
be correct. Actual results of the Company in the future may vary significantly from the historical and estimated
results and those variations may be material. There is no representation by us that actual results achieved by the
Company in the future will be the same, in whole or in part, as those included in this offering memorandum. See
“Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements”.

**_Volatility of current global economic or financial conditions_**

Current global economic or financial conditions have been subject to continued volatility. Trade wars, import tariffs,
Brexit, public protests, rising consumer debt levels, epidemics, pandemics, or outbreaks of new infectious diseases
or viruses (including, most recently, COVID-19) and the risk of sovereign debt defaults in many countries have
caused and continue to cause significant uncertainties in the markets. Although the Company takes appropriate
measures and safeguards to protect its staff from infection, these events can result in volatility and disruption to our
operations which may be beyond the control of the Company, and which could adversely affect the availability of
supplies and materials, labor, interest rates, credit ratings, credit risk, inflation, business operations, financial
markets, exchange rates and other factors material to the Company.

**Risks Related to the Notes**

**_We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us_**
**_from fulfilling our obligations under the notes._**

We have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of June 30, 2020, on an as adjusted basis for this offering we
would have had total debt of $396 million (at face value) (including the notes offered hereby and finance leases, but
excluding other lease liabilities), all of which would have been secured indebtedness. As of June 30, 2020, on an as
adjusted basis for this offering and the use of proceeds therefrom, we would have had $0.1 million of issued and
undrawn letters of credit outstanding and up to $75 million of unused commitments under our New Revolving
Credit Facility that will be available to be borrowed thereunder. See “Capitalization.”

Subject to the limitations in the indenture and the New Revolving Credit Facility, we may also incur significant
additional indebtedness in the future. Our substantial indebtedness may:

    - make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and
interest payments on the notes and our other indebtedness;

    - increase our vulnerability to adverse economic, regulatory and industry conditions;

    - limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or
other general business purposes;

    - limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital
expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;

    - require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments,
thereby reducing funds available for operations and other purposes;

    - limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;

    - make us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates; and

    - place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors.

Further, borrowings under our New Revolving Credit Facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to
interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would
increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income would decrease.

**_Our level of indebtedness may increase and reduce our financial flexibility._**

After giving effect to this offering and the effectiveness of our New Revolving Credit Facility we expect to have
$396 million (at face value) aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding (including the notes offered hereby and
finance leases, but excluding other lease liabilities), $0.1 million of issued and undrawn letters of credit outstanding
and up to $75 million available to be drawn under our New Revolving Credit Facility. Under the agreements
governing our indebtedness, we may incur additional indebtedness under the credit facilities, through the issuance of
notes, term loans or otherwise in the future. We are exposed to changes in interest rates on our cash, bank
indebtedness and long-term debt. Debt issued at variable rates exposes us to cash flow interest rate risk. Debt issued
at fixed rates exposes us to fair value interest rate risk. Our borrowings, current and future, will require interest
payments and need to be repaid or refinanced, could require us to divert funds identified for other purposes to debt
service and could create additional cash demands or impair our liquidity position and add financial risk for us.
Diverting funds identified for other purposes for debt service may adversely affect our business and growth
prospects. If we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt, we may need to refinance
our debt, dispose of assets, reduce or delay expenditures or issue equity to obtain necessary funds. We do not know
whether we would be able to take any of these actions on a timely basis, on terms satisfactory to us, or at all.


-----

Our level of indebtedness could affect our operations in several ways, including the following:

    - a significant portion of our cash flows could be used to service our indebtedness;

    - the covenants contained in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness may limit our
ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets, pay dividends and make certain investments;

    - our debt covenants may also affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in the
economy and in our industry;

    - a high level of debt would increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry
conditions;

    - a high level of debt may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are
less leveraged and therefore may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our indebtedness
would prevent us from pursuing; and

    - a high level of debt may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working
capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions or other purposes.

In addition to our debt service obligations, our operations require material expenditures on a continuing basis. Our
ability to make scheduled debt payments, to refinance our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and to fund
capital and non-capital expenditures necessary to maintain the condition of our operating assets and properties, as
well as to provide capacity for the growth of our business, depends on our financial and operating performance.
General economic conditions and financial, business and other factors affect our operations and our future
performance. Many of these factors are beyond our control. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to
pay the interest on our debt, and future working capital, borrowings or equity financing may not be available to pay
or refinance such debt.

**_We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt obligations, including our obligations under_**
**_the notes._**

Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the notes, will depend on our financial
and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain
financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from
operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness,
including the notes.

If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to
reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or
refinance our indebtedness, including the notes. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not
permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we
could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet
our debt service and other obligations. The indenture governing the notes will restrict, and our New Revolving
Credit Facility will restrict our ability to dispose of assets, use the proceeds from any disposition of assets and to
refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we
could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.

The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted, and we expect will continue to negatively impact, our cash flow
and liquidity profile. See “Summary—Recent Developments—COVID-19”. If our cash flows and capital resources
are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell
assets, seek to obtain additional equity capital or restructure our debt. In the future, our cash flows and capital
resources may not be sufficient for payments of interest on and principal of our debt, and such alternative measures
may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.

**_Despite our current level of indebtedness, we may still be able to incur substantially more indebtedness. This_**
**_could exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness._**

We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The terms of the
indenture governing the notes will limit and we expect the terms of our New Revolving Credit Facility to limit, but
do not prohibit, us or our restricted subsidiaries (including our professional service affiliates) from incurring
additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness. As of June 30, 2020, on an as adjusted basis for this
offering and the use of proceeds therefrom, we expect to have up to $75 million available for future borrowings
under our New Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, the terms of the indenture will permit us in certain
circumstances to incur additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, which may also be guaranteed by
the guarantors. If new indebtedness or other liabilities are added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we
and our subsidiaries now face could intensify.

**_Claims of holders of the notes will be structurally subordinate to claims of creditors of our subsidiaries that do_**
**_not guarantee the notes, and we have made and we may make additional equity investments in joint ventures and_**
**_minority investments that will be junior to the debt and other liabilities of such joint ventures and minority_**
**_investments. In addition, our joint ventures and minority investments will not guarantee the notes and therefore_**
**_will have no obligations to pay any amounts due on the notes._**

As described under “Description of Notes—Guarantees”, the notes will not be guaranteed by certain of our
subsidiaries and minority investments. Accordingly, claims of holders of the notes will be structurally subordinated
to the claims of creditors of our non-guarantor subsidiaries and minority investments, including trade creditors. All
obligations of our non-guarantor subsidiaries and minority investments will have to be satisfied before any of the
assets of these entities would be available for distribution, upon a liquidation or otherwise, to us or a guarantor of the
notes. In the event of the liquidation, dissolution, reorganization, bankruptcy or similar proceeding of the business of
a subsidiary, that is not a guarantor or of the businesses in which we have a minority investment, creditors of that
entity would generally have the right to be paid in full before any distribution is made to us or the holders of the
notes. In any of these events, we may not have sufficient assets to pay amounts due on the notes with respect to the
assets of that subsidiary. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, our non-guarantor subsidiaries represented
approximately 6% of our total revenue. As of June 30, 2020, our non-guarantor subsidiaries held approximately 3%
of our total assets and approximately 0.5% of our total liabilities.

Unless they are guarantors of the notes, our subsidiaries will not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the
notes or to make funds available to the issuer or the guarantors for that purpose. Our non-guarantor subsidiaries and
the businesses in which we have minority investments may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make
distributions or payments, as applicable, to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness, including the
notes. Each non-guarantor subsidiary and the businesses in which we have minority investment is a distinct legal
entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from
our non-guarantor subsidiaries and minority investments. In addition, the guarantees of certain guarantors may be
released under certain other circumstances, including in connection with a transfer of such guarantor in a transaction
not prohibited by the indenture that will govern the notes or upon certain other events described in “Description of
Notes—Guarantees.”

**_In addition, in furtherance of our business strategy, we have made and may make additional minority_**
**_investments in joint ventures. Such joint ventures will not be subject to the covenants described under_**
**_“Description of Notes—Certain Covenants” and the earnings, if any, of any such joint venture may not be_**
**_available to us, including to the extent needed to service our debt. Our equity interests in such joint ventures_**
**_would be junior to the debt and other liabilities, including trade payables, of such joint ventures, and there may_**
**_be restrictions on our right to receive cash flow from such joint ventures. We will depend on the cash flows of our_**
**_subsidiaries, minority investments and professional service affiliates in order to satisfy obligations under the_**
**_notes._**

We will rely on distributions and advances from our subsidiaries, minority investments and professional service
affiliates in order to meet our payment obligations under the notes and our other obligations. If our subsidiaries,
minority investments and professional service affiliates are unable to pay dividends or otherwise make payments to
us, we may not be able to make debt service payments on the notes. We are a holding company and conduct
substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries, minority investments and professional service affiliates.


-----

Our operating cash flows and consequently our ability to service our debt, including the notes, is therefore
principally dependent upon our subsidiaries’, minority investments’ and professional service affiliates’ earnings and
their distributions of those earnings to us and may also be dependent upon loans, advances or other payments of
funds to us by those subsidiaries, minority investments and professional service affiliates. Our subsidiaries, minority
investments and professional service affiliates are separate legal entities and to the extent they do not guarantee the
notes have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amount due pursuant to the notes or to make any funds
available for that purpose. In addition, the ability of our subsidiaries, minority investments and professional service
affiliates to provide funds to us to make payments in respect of the notes may be subject to restrictions under charter
documents, joint venture agreements or other agreements binding on such entities and may be subject to the terms of
our subsidiaries’, minority investments’ and professional service affiliates’ future indebtedness, as well as the
availability of sufficient surplus funds under applicable law.

**_If we default on our obligations to pay our indebtedness, we may not be able to make payments on the notes._**

Any default under the agreements governing our indebtedness, including a default under our New Revolving Credit
Facility, that is not waived by the required lenders thereunder, and the remedies sought by the holders of such
indebtedness, could prevent us from paying principal, premium, if any, and interest on the notes and substantially
decrease the market value of the notes. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow and are otherwise unable to
obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, or
if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants, including financial and operating covenants, in the
instruments governing our indebtedness (including a financial covenant in our New Revolving Credit Facility), we
could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness, including our New Revolving
Credit Facility, and the indenture. In the event of such default, the holders of such indebtedness could elect to
declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, the
lenders under our New Revolving Credit Facility could elect to institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets,
and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If our operating performance declines, we may in the future
need to obtain waivers from the required lenders under our New Revolving Credit Facility, to avoid being in default.
If we breach our covenants under our New Revolving Credit Facility and seek a waiver, we may not be able to
obtain a waiver from the required lenders. If this occurs, we would be in default under our New Revolving Credit
Facility, and the lenders could exercise their rights, as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or
liquidation.

**_Your right to receive payments on the notes and the guarantees is effectively subordinated to the extent that any_**
**_other indebtedness is secured by liens on assets not constituting Collateral._**

The indenture will permit us to secure additional indebtedness on assets other than the Collateral (as defined in
“Description of Notes”) in the future which may include financing for potential acquisitions, working capital, capital
expenditures, financing and capital leases or general corporate purposes. The notes will also be effectively
subordinated, or otherwise subordinated by operation of applicable law, to any of ours and the guarantors’
obligations that are secured by liens on assets that have a priority, effectively or by operation of applicable law, to
the liens securing the notes, to the extent of the value of the assets or property securing such obligations including,
as of June 30, 2020, approximately $14 million of finance leases and $1 million related to the face value of the
Wesley Chapel Loan.

If we or a guarantor becomes insolvent or is liquidated, the lenders under our or such guarantor’s indebtedness
secured by liens on assets other than the collateral will have claims on those assets securing their indebtedness and
will have priority over any claim for payment under the notes or the guarantees to the extent of such security.
Holders of the notes will participate in our remaining assets ratably with all holders of our unsecured indebtedness
that is deemed to be of the same class as the notes, and potentially with all of our other general creditors and it is
possible that there would be no assets remaining after satisfaction of the claims of such secured creditors or, if any
assets remained, they might be insufficient to fully satisfy claims of the holders of the notes.

**_The value of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the notes, our New Revolving_**
**_Credit Facility and any other secured indebtedness._**

No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has been made in connection with this offering, and the fair market value
of the Collateral is subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, general economic conditions


-----

and similar factors. The amount to be received upon a sale of the Collateral would be dependent on numerous
factors, including, but not limited to, the actual fair market value of the Collateral at such time, the timing and the
manner of the sale and the availability of buyers. By its nature, portions of the Collateral may be illiquid or
intangible and may have no readily ascertainable market value. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy
or similar proceeding, the Collateral may not be sold in a timely or orderly manner, and the proceeds from any sale
or liquidation of this Collateral may not be sufficient to pay our obligations under the notes (after taking into all of
our other obligations secured thereby on a first-priority basis). Any claim for the difference between the amount, if
any, realized by holders of the notes from the sale of the Collateral securing the notes and the obligations under the
notes will rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness and other
obligations, including trade payables. In addition, in the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar
proceeding, the lenders under our New Revolving Credit Facility will share the proceeds of the Collateral ratably
with the holders of the notes, thereby diluting the Collateral coverage.

In addition, the security interest of the notes collateral agent will be subject to practical problems generally
associated with the realization of security interests in Collateral. For example, the notes collateral agent may need to
make additional filings and obtain the consent of a third party to obtain or enforce a security interest in a contract,
and the notes collateral agent has no obligation to make such filings. We cannot assure you that the notes collateral
agent will be able to make these filings or obtain any such consent on a timely basis or at all. We also cannot assure
you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. These
requirements may limit the number of potential bidders for certain Collateral in any foreclosure or other auction and
may delay any sale, either of which events may have an adverse effect on the sale price of the Collateral. Therefore,
the practical value of realizing on the Collateral may, without the appropriate consents and filings, be limited. Also,
certain items included in the Collateral may not be transferable (by their terms or pursuant to applicable law) and
therefore the notes collateral agent may not be able to realize value from such items in the event of a foreclosure.
Accordingly, the notes collateral agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets and the value of the
Collateral may significantly decrease.

On the issue date, we will enter into the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement with the trustee, the notes collateral
agent, the administrative agent under our New Revolving Credit Facility, the collateral agent under our New
Revolving Credit Facility and the other parties thereto, which agreement will set forth the respective rights of the
holders of the notes, the lenders under our New Revolving Credit Facility and certain future creditors of debt
permitted to rank equally with the notes and the obligations under our New Revolving Credit Facility. The First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement will provide that proceeds from enforcement of the Collateral will be shared ratably among
lenders under our New Revolving Credit Facility, the holders of the notes and such future creditors. The value
realized through enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to pay all obligations under the notes and the
guarantees as well as all other obligations entitled to receive a ratable portion of such enforcement proceeds. The
indenture will also permit the issuer and the guarantors to create additional liens on the Collateral under specified
circumstances, some of which liens may be pari passu with the liens securing the notes. Any obligations secured by
such liens may further dilute the Collateral and limit the recovery from the realization of the Collateral available to
satisfy holders of the notes.

**_Holders of the notes may have only limited control over many decisions related to the Collateral._**

The rights of the holders of the notes with respect to the Collateral will be subject to the First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement among all holders of obligations secured on a first-priority basis by that Collateral, including the
obligations under our New Revolving Credit Facility (including undrawn portions under the revolving credit portion
of our New Revolving Credit Facility and any incremental facilities provided for under our New Revolving Credit
Facility) and certain future creditors of debt permitted to rank equally with the notes and the obligations under our
New Revolving Credit Facility. Under the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, the collateral agent under
our New Revolving Credit Facility will have the exclusive right (subject to limited exceptions) to exercise remedies
and take enforcement actions relating to the Collateral acting at the direction of the administrative agent under our
New Revolving Credit Facility until the earlier of (i) such date as obligations and commitments under our New
Revolving Credit Facility(and any designated refinancing thereof) have been paid in full and termination in
accordance with its terms or (ii) the date that is 120 days subsequent to the occurrence of an event of default under
the indenture or any other agreement governing first lien debt (other than our New Revolving Credit Facility)
subject to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement if the authorized representative of the holders of such debt


-----

represents the largest outstanding aggregate principal amount of indebtedness secured by a first-priority lien on the
Collateral (other than our New Revolving Credit Facility), such debt is then due and payable in full in accordance
with the terms of the agreement, and such authorized representative has complied with the applicable notice
provisions, provided that the agent under our credit facilities has not commenced and is not diligently pursuing the
exercise of remedies with respect to such Collateral or a material portion of the Collateral or the grantor of the
security interest in such Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) an insolvency or
liquidation proceeding. At any time that the administrative agent or collateral agent under our New Revolving Credit
Facility does not have the right to direct the actions with respect to the Collateral securing the notes pursuant to the
First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, the right to direct such actions will, subject to the terms and limitations of the
immediately preceding sentence, pass to the authorized representative of holders of the then largest outstanding
principal amount of indebtedness secured by a first-priority lien on the Collateral. If we have, at such time,
outstanding indebtedness that is equal in priority to the liens securing the notes and the guarantees in a greater
principal amount than the aggregate principal amount of the notes, then the authorized representative for such
indebtedness may be next in line to exercise rights under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, rather than the
notes collateral agent. The indenture and the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement permit us to incur further
indebtedness secured by liens ranking equally with the liens securing the notes and the guarantees and the
obligations under our New Revolving Credit Facility. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the notes may not
be able to act quickly or at all to have the notes collateral agent realize on the Collateral in the event of a default
with respect to the notes. See “Description of notes—Security—First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.”

Also, under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, in the event that the holders of the notes obtain possession of any
Collateral or realize any proceeds or payment in respect of any such Collateral at any time prior to the discharge of
each of the other obligations secured on a first-priority basis by the Collateral, then such holders will be obligated to
hold such Collateral, proceeds, or payment in trust for the other holders of such other first-priority obligations and
promptly transfer such Collateral, proceeds, or payment, as the case may be, to the controlling collateral agent under
the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, to be distributed in accordance with the provisions of the First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement ratably among all the holders of obligations secured on a first-priority basis by the
Collateral subject thereto.

In addition, under the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, if at any time the controlling collateral agent
under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any resulting
in a sale thereof, the lien securing the notes on such Collateral will be automatically released and discharged
(provided that any proceeds from such sale are applied ratably among all the then outstanding first-priority
obligations secured on a first priority basis by the Collateral). The Collateral so released will no longer secure our
and the guarantors’ obligations under the notes and the guarantees.

To the extent that liens securing obligations under our New Revolving Credit Facility, pre-existing liens, liens
permitted under the indenture and other rights, including liens on excluded assets, such as those securing purchase
money obligations and capital lease obligations granted to other parties (in addition to the holders of any other
obligations secured by higher priority liens to the extent permitted under the indenture), encumber any of the
Collateral securing the notes and the guarantees, those parties may have or may exercise rights and remedies with
respect to the Collateral that could adversely affect the value of the Collateral and the ability of the notes collateral
agent, the trustee under the indenture or the holders of the notes to realize or foreclose on the Collateral. By
accepting a note, you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions and will be deemed to have authorized the
notes collateral agent and the trustee to execute and deliver the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. As a result of
these restrictions, holders of the notes may not be able to act quickly or at all to have the notes collateral agent
realize on the Collateral in the event of a default with respect to the notes.

As of June 30, 2020, on an as adjusted basis, after giving effect to this offering as if it had occurred on June 30,
2020, we would have had $380 million (at face value) in indebtedness outstanding (including the notes offered
hereby (but excluding the finance leases, Wesley Chapel Loan, subordinated notes-earn-out and other lease
liabilities)), $0.1 million of issued and undrawn letters of credit outstanding and up to $75 million of unused
revolving commitments under our New Revolving Credit Facility which are secured by liens on the Collateral
ranking equal in priority with the liens securing the notes and the guarantees.

The value of the Collateral may not be sufficient to pay off all amounts we may borrow under our New Revolving
Credit Facility, the notes and additional indebtedness that we may incur that would be secured by liens on the


-----

Collateral on a pari passu basis as the notes. If the proceeds of any sale of Collateral are not sufficient to repay all
amounts due on the notes (after taking into account all of our other obligations secured thereby), the holders of the
notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only a senior unsecured,
unsubordinated claim against our and the guarantors’ remaining assets with respect to such deficiency.

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the notes under which the Collateral securing the_**
**_notes and the guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the trustee or the_**
**_notes collateral agent, and you may not realize any payment upon disposition of such Collateral._**

Under various circumstances, Collateral securing the notes will be released automatically, including:

    - a sale, transfer or other disposal of such Collateral (other than to us or one of the guarantors) in a
transaction not prohibited under the indenture and the security documents;

    - with respect to collateral held by a guarantor, upon the release of such guarantor from its guarantee in
accordance with the indenture;

    - upon satisfaction and discharge of the indenture or upon a legal defeasance or a covenant defeasance as
described under “Description of Notes—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance;”

    - with respect to all or substantially all of the Collateral, with the consent of holders holding two-thirds
or more of the principal amount of the notes (including without limitation consents obtained in
connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for, or purchase of, the notes) outstanding;

    - with respect to any guarantor that initially provided its guarantee of the notes pursuant to the covenant
described under “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Additional Subsidiary Guarantees”
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, does not include any guarantor as of the issue date), upon the
release or discharge (other than a release or discharge by or as a result of payment under such
guarantee or payment in full of such indebtedness) of the guarantee by such guarantor of the
indebtedness that resulted in the requirement for such guarantor to provide its guarantee of the notes;

    - with respect to any Collateral that becomes Excluded Property (as defined under “Description of
Notes— Security—General”), upon such Collateral becoming Excluded Property pursuant to a
transaction or circumstance not prohibited by the terms of the indenture;

    - with respect to Collateral that is capital stock, upon the dissolution of the issuer of that capital stock in
accordance with the indenture; and

    - with respect to any Collateral, in accordance with the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

The indenture will also permit us to designate one or more of our restricted subsidiaries that is a guarantor as an
unrestricted subsidiary. If we designate a guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of the indenture, all of
the liens on any Collateral owned by that subsidiary or any of its subsidiaries and any guarantees by that subsidiary
or any of its subsidiaries will be released under the indenture. Designation of an unrestricted subsidiary will reduce
the aggregate value of the Collateral to the extent that liens on the assets of the unrestricted subsidiary and its
subsidiaries are released. In addition, the creditors of the unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries will have a
senior claim on the assets of such unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries.

**_The lenders under our New Revolving Credit Facility will have the discretion to release certain guarantors under_**
**_our New Revolving Credit Facility under a variety of circumstances, which will cause those certain guarantors to_**
**_be released from their guarantees of the notes._**

So long as any obligations under our New Revolving Credit Facility remain outstanding, the guarantees of certain
guarantors added after the issue date may be released without action by, or consent of, any holder of the notes or the
trustee under the indenture governing the notes if, at the discretion of lenders under our New Revolving Credit
Facility, such guarantor’s guarantee of our New Revolving Credit Facility is released. The lenders under our New
Revolving Credit Facility will have the discretion to release such guarantees under our New Revolving Credit


-----

Facility in a variety of circumstances. Certain guarantors of the notes added after the issue date that are released as
guarantors under our New Revolving Credit Facility will automatically be released as guarantors of the notes. You
will not have a claim as a creditor against any entity that is no longer a guarantor of the notes, and the indebtedness
and other liabilities, whether secured or unsecured, of all released subsidiaries will effectively be senior to your
claims as a holder of the notes.

**_The value of the Collateral may not be sufficient to secure post-petition or post-filing interest, fees, and expenses_**
**_in an Insolvency Proceeding of us or any of the guarantors. In the event of an Insolvency Proceeding of us or_**
**_any of the guarantors, the holders of the notes would be deemed to have an unsecured claim to the extent that our_**
**_obligations in respect of the notes and all of our other obligations secured by the Collateral equal or exceed the_**
**_fair market value of the Collateral._**

In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or similar proceeding brought by or against us
or any guarantors under Title 11 U.S.C. (the “Bankruptcy Code”), the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (the
“CCAA”), the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (the “BIA”) or any similar Federal, state, provincial or foreign law for
the relief of debtors, and includes the plan of arrangement provisions of the Business Corporations Act (Ontario) and
any other applicable Federal, state or provincial corporate statute relating to the compromise or arrangement of
indebtedness (together with the Bankruptcy Code, the CCAA and the BIA, “Insolvency Law”) (such proceeding an
“Insolvency Proceeding”) located in the United States, holders of the notes will only be entitled to post-petition
interest, fees, and expenses under the Bankruptcy Code to the extent that the value of their security interest in the
Collateral securing the notes, taken in order of priority with all the other obligations secured by the Collateral, is
greater than the amount of their pre-bankruptcy claim (and all other claims against us or the guarantors that are
secured by the Collateral on a first-priority basis). While the law is not as clear in the case of an Insolvency
Proceeding located in Canada, the result would likely be the same in Canada. In such event, holders of the notes
would be deemed to have an unsecured claim to the extent that our obligations in respect of the notes (and all of our
other first-priority obligations) exceed the fair market value of the Collateral. No appraisal of the fair market value
of the Collateral has been prepared in connection with this offering and we therefore cannot assure you that the
value of the holders’ of the notes interest in the Collateral equals or exceeds the principal amount of the notes and
such other first-priority obligations. Holders of the notes that have a security interest in Collateral with a value equal
or less than the amount of their pre-insolvency claim will not be entitled to post-petition interest, fees, and expenses
under the Bankruptcy Code, and the result would likely be the same in Canada. In addition, it is possible that the
bankruptcy trustee, the debtor-in-possession or competing creditors will assert that the fair market value of the
Collateral with respect to the notes on the date of the filing of the Insolvency Proceeding was less than the then
current principal amount of the notes (and all of our other first-priority obligations). Upon a finding by a court of
competent jurisdiction presiding over an Insolvency Proceeding (a “Bankruptcy Court”) that the notes are undercollateralized, the claims in the Insolvency Proceeding with respect to the notes would be bifurcated between a
secured claim equal to the value of the interest in the Collateral and an unsecured claim, and the unsecured claim
would not be entitled to the benefits of security in the Collateral. The consequences of a finding of undercollateralization would include, among other things, a lack of entitlement on the part of the holders of the notes to
receive post-petition interest, fees, and expenses or to receive “adequate protection” under U.S. federal bankruptcy
laws on the part of the unsecured portion of the notes. In addition, if any payments of post-petition interest had been
made at the time of such a finding of under-collateralization, those payments could be recharacterized by the
Bankruptcy Court as a reduction of the principal amount of the secured claim with respect to the notes.

**_Our professional service affiliates are independent entities with independent credit risks. These independent_**
**_credit risks may cause our professional service affiliates to potentially find themselves in a position where they_**
**_elect to file for bankruptcy or related relief for reasons wholly unconnected to Akumin’s operations or the notes._**
**_If our professional service affiliates file for bankruptcy separately from these notes, the holders of the notes may_**
**_be unable to enforce claims and remedies against them._**

Our professional service affiliates constitute independent business entities with separate operations and assets, and
liabilities unrelated to the notes. As a result, they could potentially find themselves in a position where they elect to
file for bankruptcy or related relief for reasons wholly unconnected to Akumin’s operations or the notes. We have
not done any independent analysis of the credit risks these individual/separate entities face with respect to their own
operations and liabilities, and therefore can provide no assessment or assurance as to whether or not these entities
would potentially file for bankruptcy for reasons wholly unrelated to Akumin’s operations or the notes/debt. If they


-----

were to file for bankruptcy protection for unrelated reasons (including at a time when we were not in default under
the notes), applicable bankruptcy law would impact the holders of the notes’ ability to enforce claims and remedies
against them and the Collateral they are providing under their guaranties.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Bankruptcy Code allows debtors to seek disallowance of certain
types of contingent claims, including claims for reimbursement or contribution from guarantors or similar parties.

**_We will in most cases have control over the Collateral and the sale of assets could reduce the pool of assets_**
**_securing the notes and the guarantees._**

The security documents that will relate to the notes and the guarantees allow us and the guarantors, subject to certain
exceptions, to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, operate and collect, and invest and dispose of
certain income from the Collateral that will secure the notes. If we sell assets, including Collateral in which the
holders of the notes have a first-priority lien, we may replace such Collateral with other assets that would not
constitute Collateral or use the net proceeds for such sale to repay certain indebtedness. In some cases, we may sell
some or all of the Collateral in which the holders of the notes have a first-priority lien and not be required to offer to
repurchase the notes. For example, if we sell an operating business and subsequently acquire a different operating
business, the holders of the notes may lose some or all of the benefit of first-priority collateral if the acquired
business has less Collateral than the business that was sold. To the extent the proceeds from any sale of Collateral do
not constitute Collateral under the security documents, the pool of assets securing the notes and any guarantees will
be reduced, and the notes and any guarantees will not be secured by such proceeds.

**_There are also certain categories of property that are excluded from the Collateral, including property subject to_**
**_certain classes of permitted liens._**

The Collateral securing the notes will be subject to liens permitted under the terms of the indenture, whether arising
on or after the date the notes are issued, including, but not limited to, liens arising by operation of law or in the
ordinary course of business. The beneficiaries of such liens will not be required in all circumstances to join the First
Lien Intercreditor Agreement and therefore may take actions in respect of the Collateral that adversely affect the
interests of holders of the notes. The existence of any permitted liens could adversely affect the value of the
Collateral as well as the ability to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. The Collateral may also secure future
indebtedness and other obligations of us and any guarantors to the extent permitted by the indenture and the security
documents. Any future liens on the Collateral may reduce the extent of the value of the Collateral that would be
available to pay obligations under the notes and the guarantees. In addition, the imposition of certain permitted liens
may cause the relevant assets to become “excluded property,” which will not secure the notes. Assets subject to liens
in favor of third parties to secure purchase money indebtedness and capital lease obligations may be automatically
excluded from the Collateral where the agreement governing such indebtedness or obligation prohibits the grant of a
lien on such assets to the notes collateral agent or requires the consent of any person other than us or any of our
consolidated subsidiaries.

Other categories of assets that are excluded from the Collateral include, amongst other categories, fee interests in
real property, leasehold real property, vehicles, certain equity interests and certain contracts and other assets. See
“Description of Notes—Security—General” for more information regarding these and other categories of excluded
assets.

The rights of holders of the notes with respect to such excluded property will be equal to the rights of our and the
guarantors’ general unsecured creditors (and effectively junior to the rights of our and the guarantors’ creditors
whose obligations are secured by a lien on such excluded property) to the extent of the value of such excluded
property in the event of any bankruptcy filed by or against us or the guarantors under applicable U.S. federal
bankruptcy laws.

**_Certain laws and regulations may impose restrictions or limitations on foreclosure or other enforcement._**

Our obligations under the notes and the guarantors’ obligations under any guarantees are secured only by the
Collateral described in this offering memorandum. The security interests of in the Collateral will be subject to
practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral. The notes collateral
agent’s ability to foreclose on the Collateral on behalf of the holders of the notes may be subject to perfection,


-----

priority issues, state, provincial, territorial or other applicable law requirements, applicable Insolvency Law, and
practical problems associated with the realization of the notes collateral agent’s security interest in or lien on the
Collateral, including cure rights, foreclosing on, or otherwise enforcing against, the Collateral within the time
periods permitted by third parties or prescribed by laws, obtaining third-party consents, making additional filings,
statutory rights of redemption and the effect of the order of foreclosure or other enforcement. We cannot assure you
that the consents of any third parties and approvals by governmental entities or courts of competent jurisdiction will
be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure or other enforcement on such assets. Therefore, we cannot assure
you that foreclosure or other enforcement on the Collateral will be sufficient to make all payments on the notes. In
addition, to the extent that other permitted liens encumber any of the Collateral, those parties may have or exercise
rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral that could adversely affect the value of the Collateral and the
ability of the notes collateral agent to realize, foreclose on or otherwise enforce against the Collateral. Liquidating
the Collateral may not result in proceeds in an amount sufficient to pay any amounts due under the notes, our New
Revolving Credit Facility and any other pari passu secured indebtedness after also satisfying the obligations to pay
any creditors with prior liens. Furthermore, our professional service affiliates are guarantors under the notes;
however, in states where corporate practice of medicine laws prohibit any entity other than a professional
corporation or similar professional organization from practicing medicine, holders of the notes may not be permitted
to hold the equity in such entities following foreclosure on such Collateral. Likewise, we cannot be sure that such
Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in its liquidation.

**_Under certain local laws, liens securing the notes and guarantees may not have the priority described in this_**
**_offering memorandum, and may rank junior to other secured indebtedness, and you must rely on the First Lien_**
**_Intercreditor Agreement to ensure that enforcement proceeds of the Collateral are allocated in the priority_**
**_described in this offering memorandum._**

Furthermore, under local law, the security interests securing the notes and the guarantees may be subject to legal
doctrines that effectively rank them behind the security interests in favor of other obligations. Therefore, the
allocation of enforcement proceeds of the Collateral depends on the enforceability of the First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement. As a result, if the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement is found unenforceable or invalid for any reason, or
if any administrator, liquidator, or similar officer appointed under the laws of any relevant jurisdiction refuses to
give effect to it, the notes may rank junior to other outstanding secured indebtedness. In addition, certain
jurisdictions may provide certain creditors with priorities of payment in the event of a guarantor’s bankruptcy or
insolvency.

**_The collateral is subject to casualty risks._**

We currently maintain and intend to maintain insurance or otherwise insure against hazards in a manner appropriate
and customary for our business. There are, however, certain losses that may be either uninsurable or not
economically insurable, in whole or in part. Insurance proceeds may not compensate us fully for our losses. If there
is a complete or partial loss of any of the pledged Collateral, the insurance proceeds may not be sufficient to satisfy
all of the secured obligations, including the notes and the guarantees.

**_Security interests over certain of the Collateral may not be in place or perfected by the time the notes are issued._**
**_Any issues that we are not able to resolve in connection with the granting of such security interests may impact_**
**_the value of the Collateral. Creation or perfection of such security interests after the issuance of the notes_**
**_increases the risk that the liens granted by those security interests could be avoided in an Insolvency Proceeding._**

Certain security interests in favor of the notes collateral agent may not be in place by the time the notes are issued.
To the extent any liens on or security interest in the Collateral are not perfected on or prior to the issuance of the
notes, we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to have all such security interests perfected promptly
following the issuance of the Notes. Any issues that we are unable to resolve in connection with the delivery and
recordation of such security interests may negatively impact the value of the Collateral. Additionally, certain filings
and other actions required for perfection of the liens securing the notes, prior to, on and after the date of the issuance
of the notes may not be completed as a result of the occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic, including as a result of
any applicable registration system, filing offices or related service not being available. To the extent a security
interest in certain of the Collateral is perfected following the issuance of the notes, any such security interest that is
perfected within 90 days (or in some cases, potentially a year) of the commencement of an Insolvency Proceeding
would be at risk of being avoided or voided as a preferential transfer by the pledgor, as debtor in possession, by its


-----

trustee in bankruptcy, or potentially by our other creditors, which could impact the value of the Collateral, even after
the security interests perfected on the issuance date of the notes were no longer subject to such risk.

**_Rights of holders of the notes in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security_**
**_interests in certain Collateral, whether now owned or acquired in the future._**

The security interest in the Collateral securing the notes includes certain assets, both tangible and intangible,
whether now owned or acquired or arising in the future. Applicable law requires that a security interest in certain
property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest can only be perfected at the time such
property and rights are acquired and identified. The trustee and the notes collateral agent are not obligated to, and
will not, monitor, and we may not inform the trustee or the notes collateral agent of, the future acquisition of
property and rights that constitute collateral, so the necessary action may not be taken to properly perfect the
security interest in such after-acquired collateral. Similarly, the necessary perfection steps may not be taken in
respect of security over Collateral currently owned for various reasons. We will have limited obligations to perfect
the security interest of the holders of the notes in specified collateral. For example, we will not be required to
provide control agreements in respect of our deposit accounts or securities accounts and we will only be required to
make filings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the United States Copyright Office and the Canadian
Intellectual Property Office, as applicable, with respect to material intellectual property owned on the date the notes
are issued. Such failure may result in the loss of the security interest therein or the priority of the security interest in
favor of the notes against third parties. In addition, even if the liens on collateral acquired in the future are properly
perfected, such liens may (as described further herein) potentially be avoidable as a preference or otherwise in an
Insolvency Proceeding under certain circumstances. See “—Any future pledge of collateral or guarantee might be
avoidable in bankruptcy.” Neither the trustee nor the notes collateral agent have any duty to take any steps to perfect
or protect the security interest of the Collateral, or to otherwise monitor the compliance by us of our obligations
under the indenture and the Security Documents.

**_The Collateral securing the notes may be diluted under certain circumstances._**

The Collateral that will secure the notes will also secure our obligations under our New Revolving Credit Facility.
The Collateral may also secure additional senior indebtedness, including additional note offerings, that we incur in
the future, subject to restrictions on our ability to incur debts and liens under our New Revolving Credit Facility and
the indenture. Your rights to the collateral would be diluted by any increase in the indebtedness secured by the
collateral on a pari passu or priority basis.

**_Rights of holders of the notes in the Collateral may be adversely affected by Insolvency Proceedings in the United_**
**_States or Canada._**

The right of the notes collateral agent to repossess and dispose of the Collateral securing the notes upon an event of
default is likely to be significantly impaired (or at a minimum delayed) by Insolvency Law if Insolvency
Proceedings are commenced by or against us or a guarantor prior to or possibly even after the security agent has
repossessed and disposed of the Collateral.

_United States Insolvency Proceedings_

Under applicable U.S. federal bankruptcy laws, upon the commencement of a bankruptcy case, an automatic stay
goes into effect which, among other things, stays:

    - the commencement or continuation of any action or proceeding against the debtor that was or could
have been commenced before the commencement of the bankruptcy case to recover a claim against the
debtor that arose before the commencement of the bankruptcy case;

    - any act to obtain possession of, or control over, property of the debtor’s bankruptcy estate or the
debtor;

    - any act to create, perfect or enforce any lien against the property of the bankruptcy estate; and


-----

    - any act to collect or recover a claim against the debtor that arose before the commencement of the
bankruptcy case.

Under the Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor, such as the notes collateral agent, is prohibited from repossessing its
security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security repossessed from a debtor, without prior
Bankruptcy Court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances).

Moreover, U.S. bankruptcy law permits the debtor to continue to retain and to use collateral, including cash
collateral, and the proceeds, products, rents or profits of the collateral, even though the debtor is in default under the
applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection”. The meaning of the
term “adequate protection” may vary according to the circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the value
of the secured creditor’s interest in the collateral and may include cash payments or the granting of additional or
replacement security, if and at such time as the court in its discretion determines, for any diminution in the value of
the collateral as a result of the stay of repossession or disposition or any use of the collateral by the debtor during the
pendency of the bankruptcy case. A Bankruptcy Court may determine that a secured creditor may not require
compensation for a diminution in the value of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the debt it secures.
Generally, adequate protection payments, in the form of cash payments or otherwise, are not required to be paid by a
debtor to a secured creditor unless the Bankruptcy Court determines that the value of the secured creditor’s interest
in the collateral is declining during the pendency of the bankruptcy case, and any adequate protection payments
approved by the Bankruptcy Court are limited to the aggregate amount of diminution in value of the secured
creditors’ interest in the collateral occurring after the bankruptcy filing. In view of both the lack of a precise
definition of the term “adequate protection” under the Bankruptcy Code and the broad discretionary powers of a
Bankruptcy Court, it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under the notes could be made following
the commencement of a bankruptcy case or the length of the delay in making any such payments; whether or when
the notes collateral agent could or would repossess or dispose of the collateral; the value of the Collateral at any time
during the course of the bankruptcy; or whether or to what extent or in what form holders of the notes would be
compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral through the requirements of “adequate
protection” or otherwise. Furthermore, in the event the Bankruptcy Court determines that the value of the Collateral
is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the notes (and all of our other obligations that are secured by the
Collateral on a first-priority basis), the holders of the notes would have “undersecured claims” as to the difference.
U.S. federal bankruptcy laws do not permit the payment or accrual of interest, costs, expenses and attorneys’ fees
during the debtor’s bankruptcy case to holders of “undersecured claims.” As a result, bankruptcy laws may act to
limit the holders of the notes’ ability to realize upon the Collateral and to limit their ability to receive postbankruptcy interest, fees or expenses or “adequate protection” with respect to any unsecured portion of the notes.

In addition, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement will impose limitations on the ability of the holders of the notes
to object to a proposed debtor-in-possession financing or the use of cash collateral or to the Liens (or court-ordered
charges) securing the same (assuming certain protections and other requirements are in place in connection
therewith with respect to their liens on the Collateral and certain related rights) unless the authorized agent for the
lenders under our New Revolving Credit Facility opposes or objects thereto. See “Description of Notes—Security—
First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.” After such a filing, the value of the Collateral could materially deteriorate, and
holders of the notes would be unable to raise an objection.

_Canadian Insolvency Proceedings_

We are incorporated in, and subject to, the laws of the province of Ontario and the federal laws of Canada applicable
therein. Canadian Insolvency Law, which are principally contained in the CCAA and the BIA, are different from the
corporate insolvency or bankruptcy laws of the United States, however can be generally understood as analogous to
Chapter 11 and Chapter 7, respectively. These statutes apply across the country and allow for either a liquidation
type proceeding or a restructuring type proceeding.

As a result of these laws, among other things, noteholders and beneficiaries of guarantees could be stayed from
enforcing upon their notes, guarantees and corresponding security after the commencement of Insolvency
Proceedings in Canada, or retaining security enforced upon prior to the commencement of such proceedings.
Moreover, in such proceedings, subject to the oversight of the applicable Bankruptcy Court, the issuer or guarantor
(or its trustee in bankruptcy, receiver or similar representative) may be permitted to continue to use Collateral,
including cash collateral, even though the issuer and/or guarantor is in default under the applicable notes and/or


-----

guarantees. Moreover, there is no guarantee that payments will be made on account of secured debt, such as the
notes and guarantees, during the pendency of a Canadian Insolvency Proceeding, or whether and to what extent
holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delays in payment, if any, of principal, interest and costs,
including the fees and disbursements of the notes collateral agent. Canadian Insolvency Law does not include the
concept of “adequate protection” liens or payments.

In addition, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement will impose limitations on the ability of the holders of the notes
to take certain positions in a Canadian Insolvency Proceeding. See “Description of notes—Security—First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement.”

Canadian Insolvency Proceedings - Liquidation

Bankruptcy proceedings in Canada can be either voluntarily commenced by a debtor or commenced against the
debtor by a creditor. Upon a bankruptcy occurring, all of the assets of the bankrupt (with a few limited exceptions)
vest in a trustee in bankruptcy, with the proceedings being subject to the oversight of both the Superintendent of
Bankruptcy and the relevant Bankruptcy Court. Typically, a trustee in bankruptcy proceeds to liquidate the assets of
the bankrupt and distribute the proceeds to creditors in accordance with their legal priorities.

The BIA and certain other federal and provincial statutes in Canada provide super-priority status to certain claims.
These super-priority status claims are secured on certain assets of the debtor and such security may rank in priority
to the security of other secured creditors, including security granted in connection with the notes and guarantees.
After the claims subject to statutory super-priorities are paid, the BIA provides that secured creditors are to be paid
prior to unsecured creditors.

The BIA imposes a stay of proceedings on unsecured creditors in a bankruptcy and leave is required to proceed, or
continue, with any actions against the bankrupt entity; the stay generally does not apply to secured creditors, though
a stay may apply to secured creditors for up to six months in certain circumstances. If no stay applies, secured
creditors are free to commence or continue to enforce their security against the assets of the bankrupt, subject to
satisfying the trustee in bankruptcy that they have valid and perfected security over the same.

A secured creditor may also appoint a “receiver” or “receiver-manager” over the assets of a debtor, or may seek
court appointment of a receiver or receiver and manager. A receivership is intended as a mechanism for realizing on
collateral through a liquidation or a going-concern sale. The receivership remains subject to many of the
considerations in a bankruptcy, including super-priorities, reporting obligations, etc. although certain priorities will
be different where no bankruptcy is involved. Receivers appointed by the court are routinely authorized to borrow to
fund the receivership proceedings, on a super-priority basis. A receiver is often appointed where only the secured
creditors are likely to be paid out of the realizations or there is an opportunity to realize higher returns through a
going-concern sale of the business than a piecemeal liquidation. Ultimately, however, the effect is the same: the
realization on the debtor’s assets in favor of those creditors legally entitled to the proceeds.

Canadian Insolvency Proceedings - Restructuring

Generally, restructuring proceedings of insolvent entities are commenced under one of the CCAA or BIA, although
it is also possible to restructure a solvent enterprise under the reorganization or arrangement provisions of the
applicable federal or provincial corporate statute. Any such restructuring can, and almost always will, involve a stay
of proceedings with respect to creditors’ rights and remedies and a compromise of the debt, including secured debt,
owing by the restructuring entity. Such stays of proceedings, unlike under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, are
not automatic.

For large or complex restructurings, the most commonly used statute is the CCAA. The granting of an order for
relief under the CCAA is in the discretion of the court, but if granted, a CCAA initial order typically involves a
broad stay of proceedings (applying to secured and unsecured creditors), protection from the termination of
contracts by third parties, and, in certain cases, the granting of super-priority security interests or charges (which
could be in priority to the security of existing secured creditors) on the assets of the applicant debtor company to
secure the payment of any amounts to be borrowed from debtor-in-possession lenders to facilitate the restructuring,
any amounts owing for the fees and costs of professionals involved in the restructuring, obligations of directors of
the company with respect to their statutory liabilities and sometimes other amounts. Unlike a Chapter 11 proceeding,


-----

post-filing assets of a debtor company are encumbered by pre-filing security interests, and so there are no
unencumbered assets (including cash collateral) against which adequate protection liens could be granted.
Accordingly, secured creditors who are primed by debtor-in-possession financing or other charges are not given
replacement liens to the extent of their subordination.

Debtors in Canada may also proceed with a restructuring under the proposal provisions of the BIA. The proposal
provisions of the BIA (the “Proposal Provisions”) provide for a process that is generally similar to, but less flexible
than, restructuring proceedings under the CCAA. Upon filing a proposal (or a notice of intention to make a
proposal), the BIA provides an automatic stay of proceedings, however the stay only applies to secured creditors if
the proposal includes an offer to secured creditors. Such stay will remain in place until the trustee administering the
proposal proceedings is discharged (e.g., the proposal is implemented and the proceedings concluded) or the debtor
becomes bankrupt (e.g., via a failed proposal, as discussed below). The stay does not prevent a secured creditor from
(i) dealing with the assets of the insolvent person if it took possession of the secured assets for the purpose of
realization before the filing of the proposal or notice of intention to file a proposal and (ii) enforcing its security
against the debtor if the secured creditor gave the required notice under the BIA more than ten days before the filing
of the proposal or notice of intention to file a proposal, or if the debtor consents to the enforcement by the secured
creditor in accordance with the BIA. In the case of any proceedings under the Proposal Provisions, the applicant
debtor is protected from the termination of most contracts by third parties.

The Proposal Provisions allow for the granting of super priority charges (similar to the CCAA), including to secure
debtor-in-possession financing. Like in the CCAA, no adequate protection payments or liens are available under the
Proposal Provisions, because there are no unencumbered assets created by the filing.

Canadian Insolvency Proceedings – Recognition Proceedings

In the event of a foreign insolvency proceeding, both the CCAA and the BIA allow a representative, authorized in a
foreign proceeding in respect of a debtor, to seek recognition of the foreign insolvency proceeding in Canada (which
is similar to a Chapter 15 type proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code). The CCAA and the BIA each provide for a
modified version of the UNCITRAL model insolvency law.

**_In the event of an Insolvency Proceeding of us or any of the guarantors, holders of the notes may be deemed to_**
**_have an unsecured claim to the extent that our obligations in respect of the notes and all of our other obligations_**
**_secured by the Collateral exceed the value of the collateral available to secure the notes and such other_**
**_obligations._**

No appraisal of the fair market value of the Collateral securing the notes has been made in connection with this
offering and the value of the Collateral will depend on market and economic conditions, the availability of buyers
and other factors. The book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such
assets. We cannot assure you of the value of the Collateral or that the net proceeds received upon a sale of the
Collateral would be sufficient to repay all, or would not be substantially less than, amounts due on the notes
following a foreclosure upon the Collateral (and any payments in respect of prior liens) or a liquidation of our assets
or the assets of the guarantors that may grant these security interests. (after taking into account all of our other
obligations that are also secured by the Collateral on a first-priority basis).

In any Insolvency Proceeding with respect to us or any of the guarantors, it is possible that the bankruptcy trustee,
the debtor-in-possession, any official committee of unsecured creditors appointed in such Insolvency Proceeding or
any other creditor (secured or unsecured) will assert that the value of the Collateral securing the notes and all of our
other obligations secured by the Collateral is less than the aggregate amount of the principal and other amounts
outstanding under the notes and such other obligations. Upon a finding by the Bankruptcy Court that the notes are
under-collateralized, the claims in the Insolvency Proceeding with respect to the notes would be bifurcated between
secured claims up to the value of the collateral securing the notes and an unsecured claim for any deficiency. The
consequences of a finding of under-collateralization would include, among other things, (i) a lack of entitlement on
the part of the holders of the notes to receive post-petition interest, fees, costs and expenses otherwise payable under
the notes, and (ii) a lack of entitlement to receive “adequate protection” under U.S. Insolvency Laws with respect to
the unsecured portion of the notes. In addition, if any payments of post-petition interest, fees, costs and expenses had
been made on account of the notes at or before the time of such a finding of under-collateralization, those payments
could be recharacterized by the Bankruptcy Court as a reduction of the principal amount of the notes. For these


-----

purposes, the value of any collateral that the collateral trustee does not have a perfected security interest in will be
zero.

In the event of a liquidation, foreclosure or other enforcement, the value of the Collateral securing the notes is
subject to fluctuations based on factors that include general economic conditions, the actual fair market value of the
Collateral at such time, the timing and the manner of the sale and the availability of buyers and similar factors. The
value of the assets pledged as Collateral for the notes also could be impaired in the future as a result of our failure to
implement our business strategy, competition or other future trends. In addition, courts could limit recoverability
with respect to the Collateral if they apply certain laws to a proceeding and deem a portion of the interest claim
usurious in violation of applicable public policy. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral may be illiquid and may
have no readily ascertainable market value. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Collateral will be saleable or, if
saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in its liquidation. A portion of the Collateral may include assets that
may only be usable, and thus retain value, as part of our existing operating business. Accordingly, any such sale of
the Collateral separate from the sale of certain of our operating businesses may not be feasible or of significant
value. To the extent that liens, rights and easements granted to third parties encumber assets located on property
owned by us or the subsidiary guarantors or constitute senior, pari passu or subordinate liens on the Collateral, those
third parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property subject to such encumbrances
(including rights to require marshalling of assets) that could adversely affect the value of the Collateral located at a
particular site and the ability of the trustee to realize, foreclose on or otherwise enforce against the Collateral at that
site.

**_Lien searches may not reveal all liens on the Collateral and lien searches may not be completed until after the_**
**_date of the Offering Memorandum._**

We cannot guarantee that the lien searches on the Collateral that will secure the notes and any guarantees will reveal
any or all existing liens on such Collateral. Any such existing lien, including undiscovered liens, could be
significant, could be prior in ranking to the liens securing the notes and guarantees thereof and could have an
adverse effect on the ability of the notes collateral agent to realize or foreclose upon the Collateral securing the notes
and any guarantees thereof.

Lien searches on the collateral may not be completed until after the date of this offering memorandum. These lien
searches, once completed, could reveal a prior lien or multiple prior liens on the Collateral and these prior liens may
prevent or inhibit the collateral agent from foreclosing on the liens that will secure the notes and may impair the
value of the Collateral.

**_Any future pledge of collateral or guarantee might be avoidable._**

Any security interests or guarantees issued after the issue date of the notes may be treated under Insolvency Law as
if they were delivered to secure or guarantee previously existing indebtedness. Accordingly, any future pledge of
collateral or future issuance of a guarantee in favor of the notes collateral agent or the holders of the notes, including
pursuant to security documents or guarantees delivered in connection therewith after the date of the indenture, might
be avoidable by the pledgor or guarantor (as debtor-in-possession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy (or potentially by
certain of our other creditors) as a preference or otherwise if certain events or circumstances exist or occur,
including, among others, if (i) the pledgor or guarantor is insolvent at the time of the pledge or the issuance of the
guarantee, (ii) the pledge or the issuance of the guarantee permits the holders of the notes to receive a greater
recovery than they would receive if the pledge or guarantee had not been given and the pledgor or guarantor were
liquidated under a hypothetical case under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code or, in Canada, the pledge or the
issuance of the guarantee has the effect of giving the recipient creditor a preference, and (iii) an Insolvency
Proceeding in respect of the pledgor or guarantor is commenced within 90 days following the pledge or the
perfection thereof or the issuance of the guarantee (as applicable), or, in certain circumstances, a longer period.
Accordingly, if an Insolvency Proceeding was commenced in respect of us or any guarantor after the issue date of
the notes and (1) any liens not granted on the issue date of the notes were perfected, or (2) any guarantees not issued
on the issue date of the notes (as applicable) were issued, within 90 days (or potentially one year for any “insiders”
or a recipient not “dealing at arms length”) before the commencement of such Insolvency Proceeding, such liens or
guarantees would be more likely to be avoided as a preference by the Bankruptcy Court than if delivered and
promptly recorded on the issue date of the notes (even if the liens perfected or other guarantees issued on the issue
date of the notes would no longer be subject to such risk). To the extent that the grant of any such mortgage or other


-----

security interest and/or guarantee is avoided as a preference or otherwise, holders of the notes would lose the benefit
of the mortgage or security interest and/or guarantee (as applicable).

Under certain applicable law in Canada, such pledges or issuances could be voided by a Canadian court even if the
pledgor or issuer was not insolvent at the time of the pledge or issuance, and no Insolvency Proceeding was
subsequently commenced, if the pledgor or issuer intended to defeat, delay or prejudice one or more of its creditors
by making the pledge or issuance.

**_There are restrictions on your ability to transfer or resell the notes without registration under applicable_**
**_securities laws._**

This offering is being made pursuant to an exemption from registration under United States and applicable state
securities laws. Therefore, you may transfer or resell the notes in the United States only in a transaction registered
under or exempt from the registration requirements of the United States and applicable state securities laws, and you
may be required to bear the risk of your investment for an indefinite period of time. See “Transfer Restrictions.” By
receiving the notes, you will be deemed to have made certain acknowledgments, representations and agreements as
set forth under “Transfer Restrictions.” We will not be required to, and do not intend to, register the notes with the
SEC pursuant to a registration rights agreement.

**_The indenture has not been and will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and we will not be required to_**
**_comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act._**

The indenture has not been and will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (the “Trust Indenture
Act”) and we will not be required to comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act. Therefore, holders of the
notes will not be entitled to the benefit of the provisions and protection of the Trust Indenture Act except to the
extent there are similar provisions in the indenture.

**_Your ability to transfer the notes may be limited by the absence of an active trading market, and an active trading_**
**_market may not develop for the notes._**

The notes are a new issue of securities for which there is currently no market. We do not intend to have the notes
listed on a national securities exchange or to arrange for quotation on any automated dealer quotation system. The
initial purchasers are not obligated to make a market in the notes, and, to the extent that the initial purchasers make a
market in the notes, they may discontinue their market-making activities at any time without notice. Therefore, we
cannot assure you as to the development or liquidity of any trading market for the notes. The liquidity of any market
for the notes will depend on a number of factors, including:

    - the number of holders of the notes;

    - our operating performance and financial condition;

    - the market for similar securities;

    - the interest of securities dealers in making a market in the notes; and

    - prevailing interest rates.

Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial
volatility in the prices of securities similar to the notes. The market, if any, for the notes may face similar disruptions
that may adversely affect the prices at which you may sell your notes. Therefore, you may not be able to sell your
notes at a particular time and the price that you receive when you sell may not be favorable.


-----

**_The notes or a subsidiary guarantee (or the related security interests) could be voided if it constitutes a fraudulent_**
**_transfer or fraudulent conveyance under Insolvency Law, or similar state or provincial law, which would prevent_**
**_the holders of the notes from relying on us or that subsidiary (or the related security interests) to satisfy claims._**

_Preferences and Fraudulent Transfers in the United States_

Under U.S. bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance laws,
the notes or a guarantee (or the related security interests) can be voided, or claims under the notes or the guarantee
may be subordinated to all other debts of the issuer or that guarantor if, among other things, the issuer or the
guarantor, at the time it incurred the indebtedness evidenced by the notes or its guarantee or, in some states, when
payments become due under the notes or the guarantee, received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair
consideration for the incurrence of the notes or the guarantee (and the related security interests) and:

    - was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence;

    - was engaged (or about to engage) in a business or transaction for which the issuer’s or the guarantor’s
remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital; or

    - intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay those debts as they
mature.

The notes or a guarantee (or the related security interests) may also be voided, without regard to these factors, if a
court finds that the issuer issued the notes or the guarantor entered into the guarantee (and provided the related
security interests) with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud its creditors.

As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation,
property is transferred or a valid antecedent indebtedness is satisfied. A court would likely find that the issuer or a
guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the notes or such guarantee and/or
lien if the issuer or such guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the notes
or the applicable guarantee and/or lien. Thus, if the guarantees were legally challenged, any guarantee could be
subject to the claim that, since the guarantee was incurred for the issuer’s benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit
of the guarantor, the obligations of the applicable guarantor were incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value
or fair consideration. Therefore, a court could void the obligations under the Guarantees and the related liens,
subordinate them to the applicable guarantor’s other indebtedness or take other action detrimental to the holders of
the notes. If a court were to void a guarantee, you would no longer have a claim against the guarantor. Sufficient
funds to repay the notes may not be available from other sources, including the remaining guarantors, if any. In
addition, the court might direct you to repay any amounts that you already received from the subsidiary guarantor.

The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance laws vary depending upon
the governing law, such that we cannot be certain as to: the standards a court would use to determine whether or not
the issuer or the guarantors were solvent at the relevant time, or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, that it
would not determine that the issuer or a guarantor was indeed insolvent on that date; that any payments to the
holders of the notes (including under the guarantees) did not constitute preferences, fraudulent conveyances or
fraudulent transfers on other grounds; or that the issuance of the notes and the guarantees would not be subordinated
to the Issuer’s or any guarantor’s other indebtedness. Generally, the issuer or a guarantor would be considered
insolvent if:

    - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, were greater than the fair value of all its assets;

    - the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount that would be required to pay its
probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and
mature; or

    - it could not pay its debts as they become due.

Each subsidiary guarantee will contain a provision intended to limit the guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount
that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its subsidiary guarantee to be a fraudulent


-----

transfer or fraudulent conveyance. However, this provision may not be effective as a legal matter or otherwise to
protect the subsidiary guarantees from being voided under fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance law, or may
reduce that guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its guarantee worthless.

In addition, any payment by the issuer pursuant to the notes or by a guarantor under a guarantee made at a time the
issuer or such guarantor was found to be insolvent could be voided and required to be returned to the issuer or such
guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the issuer’s or such guarantor’s creditors if such payment is made to an
insider within a one-year period prior to a bankruptcy filing or within 90 days for any non-insider party and such
payment would give such insider or non-insider party (as the case may be) more than such creditor would have
received in a distribution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case.

Finally, as a court of equity, the bankruptcy court may otherwise subordinate the claims in respect of the notes or the
guarantees to other claims against the issuer or the guarantors under the principle of “equitable subordination”, if the
court determines that: (i) the holders of the notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct; (ii) such inequitable
conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holders of the notes; and
(iii) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

_Preferences, Transfers-at-Undervalue and Fraudulent Conveyances in Canada_

In the context of Canadian Insolvency Proceedings, a trustee in bankruptcy, monitor or proposal trustee may be
required to review asset transfers and transactions undertaken by the bankrupt or insolvent debtor within specified
time periods prior to the commencement of the Insolvency Proceedings to determine if the debtor was engaged in
any preferential transactions or transfers at undervalue. In the case of transfers at undervalue, the review period is
one year (or five years for parties not dealing at arm’s length) and preferences are subject to review if they occurred
within three months (or twelve months for parties not dealing at arm’s length). Provincial laws regarding fraudulent
preferences, transfers at undervalue and fraudulent conveyances may also apply, and may have longer applicable
review periods.

A note issued, secured granted, or guarantee given (each an “Issuance”) to an arm’s length party could be voided as
a preference if the issuer made the Issuance with the intent of defeating, delaying or defrauding creditors or with a
view to giving the creditor a preference (if the Issuance has the effect of bestowing a preference, intent is presumed)
and could be voided as a transfer at undervalue if (1) the issuer was insolvent at the time the Issuance was made, or
rendered insolvent by reason of the Issuance and (2) the issuer did not receive any consideration for the Issuance, or
if the consideration received for the Issuance was conspicuously less than the fair market value of the Issuance. In
the case of parties not dealing at arm’s length, neither the insolvency nor the intention of the party making the
Issuance is relevant to the determination of whether or not the Issuance was a preference or a transfer at undervalue
in the first twelve months prior to such Issuance.

Provincial legislation applicable in Canada also provides for an Issuance to be voided if it is preferential or
determined to be a fraudulent conveyance. The standard of proof and look-back periods vary, but generally the
transfer must be made with the intention to defeat, delay or prejudice creditors, and in many cases do not require the
issuer to be insolvent or rendered insolvent by the Issuance in order for the Issuance to be voided.

If a court were to find that the Issuance was a preference, transfer at undervalue or fraudulent conveyance, the court
could void the payment obligations under the note or guarantee or subordinate the corresponding security to
presently existing and future indebtedness of the applicable guarantor, or require the holders of the Notes or
guarantees to repay any amounts received. In the event of a finding that a preference, transfer at undervalue or
fraudulent conveyance occurred, the holders of the Notes may not receive any repayment on the Notes.

We cannot be certain that the issuance of the guarantees or any security would not be subordinated to any of the
issuer or guarantors’ other debt or determined by a court to be void.

**_Upon a change of control of us, we may not have the funds necessary to finance the change of control offer_**
**_required by the indenture, which would violate the terms of the notes._**

Upon the occurrence of a change of control of us, holders of the notes will have the right to require us to purchase
all or any part of the notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any,


-----

to the date of purchase. We may not have sufficient financial resources available to satisfy all of our obligations
under the notes in the event of a change in control. Accordingly, we may be unable to satisfy our obligations to
purchase the notes. Our failure to purchase the notes as required under the indenture would result in a default under
the indenture and a cross-default under our New Revolving Credit Facility, each of which could have material
adverse consequences for us and the holders of the notes. In addition, our New Revolving Credit Facility provides
that a change of control is a default that permits lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings under it.

**_Certain covenants contained in the indenture will not be applicable during any period in which the notes are_**
**_rated investment grade._**

The indenture governing the notes will provide that certain covenants will not apply to us and our restricted
subsidiaries (including our professional service affiliates) during any period in which the notes are rated investment
grade by both Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and no default or event of
default has otherwise occurred and is continuing under the indenture. The covenants that would be suspended
include, among others, limitations on and our restricted subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends, incur indebtedness,
sell certain assets and enter into certain other transactions. Any actions that we take while these covenants are not in
force will not constitute an event of default even if the notes are subsequently downgraded below investment grade
and such covenants are subsequently reinstated. See “Description of Notes–Suspension of covenants.” There can be
no assurance that the notes will ever be rated investment grade, or that if they are rated investment grade, the notes
will maintain such ratings.

**_The trading prices for the notes will be directly affected by many factors, including our credit rating._**

Credit rating agencies continually revise their ratings for companies they follow, including us. Any ratings
downgrade could adversely affect the trading price of the notes, or the trading market for the notes, to the extent a
trading market for the notes develops. The condition of the financial and credit markets and prevailing interest rates
have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future, and any fluctuation may impact the trading price
of the notes.

**_Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to_**
**_increase significantly._**

Borrowings under our New Revolving Credit Facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate
risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness could increase even
though the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for
servicing our indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease. As of June 30, 2020, on an as adjusted basis after
giving effect to this offering and assuming we have not made any drawings under our New Revolving Credit
Facility, approximately $5 million of our debt would have been variable rate debt (a derivative financial instrument).
Our interest expense for this debt for the six months ended June 30, 2020 was approximately $0.4 million. In the
future, we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in
order to reduce interest rate volatility. However, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our
variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk.

**_We will not be subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002._**

Because we will not register the notes under the Securities Act after this offering, we will not be subject to the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires public companies to have and maintain effective disclosure controls
and procedures to ensure timely disclosure of material information, and have management review the effectiveness
of those controls on a quarterly basis. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 also requires public companies to have and
maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and preparation of financial statements, and have management review the effectiveness of
those controls on an annual basis (and have the independent accountant attest to the effectiveness of such internal
controls). We will not be required to comply with these requirements, and therefore we will not have comparable
procedures in place as compared to public companies.

**_Holders of notes may not be able to determine when a change of control giving rise to their right to have the_**
**_notes purchased has occurred following a sale of “substantially all” of our assets._**


-----

The definition of change of control in the indenture includes a phrase relating to the sale of “all or substantially all”
of our assets. There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, the ability of a holder of notes to require us to purchase the notes as a result of a sale of less than all
our assets to another person may be uncertain. See “Description of Notes—Change of Control.”

**_We are not providing all of the financial and other information that would be required if this offering were being_**
**_registered with the SEC._**

This offering memorandum does not include all of the information that would be required if we were registering this
offering of the notes with the SEC. In particular, the offering memorandum does not include certain pro forma
financial information that would otherwise have been required to be prepared in accordance with Article 11 of
Regulation S-X as promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act. We urge you to consider this factor in
connection with your evaluation of your investment in the notes.

**_Interest paid on the notes may be treated as U.S. source interest, in which case, U.S. federal withholding tax of_**
**_30% may apply unless a non-U.S. holder qualifies for an exemption from such withholding tax._**

It is contemplated that the net proceeds of this offering will directly or indirectly be on-lent by us to a wholly-owned
U.S. subsidiary of the issuer and used to repay outstanding obligations of such U.S. subsidiary. As a result, the IRS
could argue that the issuance of the notes, together with the contemplated on-lending, is a tax avoidance plan and
that interest on the notes is U.S. source interest, which if paid to a non-U.S. holder is subject to withholding tax at
30% unless the non-U.S. holder qualifies for an applicable exemption.

Although not free from doubt, we do not believe that the issuance of the notes and the contemplated on-lending
constitute a tax avoidance plan because we expect holders of the notes to be U.S holders or non-U.S. holders who
qualify for an exemption from the 30% withholding tax. In this regard, to assist us in establishing that no tax
avoidance plan exists, each investor will, if requested by us, take commercially reasonable efforts to provide an
applicable U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 or W-9.

**_We are in the process of negotiating the terms of our New Revolving Credit Facility with potential revolving_**
**_lenders and as such we cannot assure you that the New Revolving Credit Facility will become effective on the_**
**_issue date on the terms set forth in this offering memorandum or at all._**

We expect to enter into the New Revolving Credit Facility on the issue date and expect to have up to $75 million of
availably borrowing capacity thereunder. However, since we are still negotiating with lenders we cannot assure you
that we will be able to receive commitments equal to $75 million and it is possible that the aggregate amount of
revolving credit commitments under our New Revolving Credit Facility is significantly less than $75 million. In
addition, the entry into the New Revolving Credit Facility is subject to market conditions and there can be no
assurance that we will be able to obtain revolving commitments on the terms set forth herein or at all.


-----

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We estimate that our net proceeds from this offering, after deducting initial purchaser discounts and commissions,
will be approximately $    million. We intend to use such proceeds to repay in full all outstanding borrowings and
terminate all commitments under our Existing Credit Agreement and to pay related financing fees and expenses.

Certain of the initial purchasers, or their affiliates, are lenders under our Existing Credit Agreement that will be
repaid with the proceeds of this offering. As such, certain of the initial purchasers, or their affiliates, will receive a
portion of the proceeds from this offering. See “Plan of Distribution”.

The table below sets forth the estimated sources and uses of funds in connection with this offering, based on
estimated amounts outstanding at the closing of this offering. Actual amounts may vary from the estimated amounts
shown below depending on several factors, including accrued interest on our indebtedness, working capital needs,
and differences from our estimated fees, costs, and expenses.

You should read the following together with the information included under the sections entitled “Capitalization”
and “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information and Other Data” included elsewhere in

(5) Excludes other lease liabilities of $135 million as of June 30, 2020.

(6) We expect to enter into our New Revolving Credit Facility on the issue date, but the effectiveness of such New Revolving Credit Facility is
not a condition to the issuance of the notes offered hereby. The New Revolving Credit Facility is expected to have up to $75 million of
available revolving credit commitments thereunder which we expect to be undrawn on the issue date. Although we are seeking revolving
credit commitments of up to $75 million from financial institutions, no assurance can be made that we will be able to secure revolving
commitments in this amount (or at all) and the actual amount of revolving credit commitments under our New Revolving Credit Facility may
be less than $75 million.

**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF**
**OPERATIONS**

_You should read the following discussion of the results of operations and financial condition of the Company_
_together with the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. Amounts_
_stated in this section, including RVUs and dollar amounts, are in thousands, unless otherwise stated._

**Overview**

We are a provider of outpatient diagnostic imaging services in the United States, with freestanding centers located
across Florida, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Texas, Georgia, Illinois and Kansas. Our centers provide physicians with
imaging capabilities to facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of diseases and disorders and may reduce unnecessary
invasive procedures, minimizing the cost and amount of care for patients. Our services include magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), ultrasound, X-ray,
mammography and other diagnostic or interventional radiology procedures.

We seek to develop leading positions in regional markets in order to leverage operational efficiencies. Our scale and
density within selected geographies in the United States provides for long-term relationships with key payors,
radiology groups and referring physicians. Our operations team is responsible for managing relationships with local
physicians and payors, meeting our standards of patient service and improving profitability. We provide corporate
training programs, standardized policies and procedures and sharing of best practices among the physicians in our
regional networks.

**Summary of Factors Affecting Our Performance**

**_Number of Clinics_**

We have a meaningful opportunity to continue to grow the number of our diagnostic imaging facilities in the United
States through organic growth and acquisition. The opening and success of new facilities is subject to numerous
factors, including our ability to finance acquisitions, build relationships with referring doctors in new regions, and
negotiate suitable lease terms for new locations, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control.

The following table shows the number of our diagnostic imaging facilities:


**As at**
**June 30, 2020**


**As at**
**Dec 31, 2019**


**As at**
**Dec 31, 2018**


**As at**
**Dec 31, 2017**


Number of Diagnostic Imaging Facilities...... 128 129 96 74

**_Competition_**

The market for diagnostic imaging services is highly competitive. We compete principally on the basis of our
reputation, our ability to provide multiple modalities at many of our facilities, the location of our facilities and the
quality of our diagnostic imaging services. In the markets in which we are operating, or anticipate operating, we
compete locally with groups of radiologists, established hospitals, clinics and other independent organizations that
own and operate imaging equipment.

We also face competition from other diagnostic imaging companies in acquiring diagnostic imaging centers, which
makes it more difficult to find attractive acquisition targets on favorable terms.

Our multi-modality imaging offering provides a one-stop-shop for patients and referring physicians and diversifies
our revenue sources. Our scalable and integrated operating platform is expected to create value from future
acquisitions, cost efficiencies, and organic growth.


-----

**_Industry Trends_**

Our revenue is impacted by changes to U.S. healthcare laws, our partners’ and contractors’ healthcare costs, and/or
reimbursement rates by payors.

**How We Assess the Performance of Our Business**

The key performance indicator measures below are used by management in evaluating the performance of and
assessing our business. We refer to certain key performance indicators used by management and typically used by
our competitors in the diagnostic imaging industry, certain of which are not recognized under IFRS. See “Non-IFRS
Measures”.

**_IFRS Measures_**

Our revenue is comprised of service fee revenue and other revenue. The following is a brief description of the
components of our revenue:

    - Service fee revenue, net of contractual allowances and discounts, consists of net patient fees received
from various payers and patients based mainly on established contractual billing rates, less allowances
for contractual adjustments and discounts and allowances. This service fee revenue is primarily
comprised of fees for the use of our diagnostic imaging equipment and provision of medical supplies.
Service fee revenue is recorded during the period in which our performance obligations are satisfied,
based on the estimated collectible amounts from the patients and third-party payers. Third party payers
include federal and state agencies (such as Medicare and Medicaid programs), managed care health
plans, commercial insurance companies, other payors, and employers. Estimates of contractual
allowances are based on the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements. Contractual
payment terms in managed care agreements are based on predetermined rates per discounted fee-forservice rates. A provision for credit losses is also recorded, based partly on historical collection
experience. We regularly attempt to estimate its expected reimbursement for patients based on the
applicable contract terms. We believe our review process enables us to identify instances on a timely
basis where such estimates need to be revised.

    - Other revenue consists of miscellaneous fees under contractual arrangements, including service fee
revenue under capitation arrangements with third party payers, management fees and fees for other
services provided to third parties. Revenue is recorded during the period in which our performance
obligations under the contract are satisfied by us.

**_Non-IFRS Measures_**

This offering memorandum makes reference to certain non-IFRS measures. For a discussion on how we utilize nonIFRS measures, see “Non-IFRS Measures”. For a reconciliation of Non-IFRS measures to the most directly
comparable IFRS financial performance measure see “Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Other
Information.”

**Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results**

**_Acquisition Activity_**

The timing of acquisitions and the opening of new facilities impacts our revenue and the comparability of our results
from period to period. In addition, facilities operating in different regions in the United States may have dissimilar
results due to prevailing reimbursement rates for diagnostic imaging services or other factors.

**_Newly Adopted Accounting Standards_**

Our condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the significant accounting
policies consistent with those applied in our December 31, 2019 consolidated financial statements, except as
described in Note 3 of the condensed interim consolidated financial statements relating to the amendments to IFRS 3
and IAS 1 and IAS 8 which became effective January 1, 2020. The adoption of the amendments to these standards


-----

did not have a material impact on the condensed interim consolidated financial statements in the current or
comparative periods. We were not required to make retrospective adjustments as a result of adopting these
standards.

**_Segments_**

We identify our reporting segments based on the organizational units used by management to monitor performance
and make operating decisions. We have identified one operating segment: outpatient diagnostic medical imaging
services.

**Recent Developments**

**_Tuck-in Acquisitions_**

On January 1, 2020, we acquired, through a subsidiary, in two separate transactions, a single outpatient diagnostic
imaging center in Coral Springs, Florida and a single outpatient diagnostic imaging center in Crystal Lake, Illinois,
for aggregate cash consideration of approximately $3.3 million (the “2020 Acquisitions”). Both acquisitions were
opportunities for us to increase its presence in their respective markets.

**_COVID-19_**

Commencing during the first quarter of 2020 and continuing through second quarter of 2020 and beyond, a
pandemic relating to the novel coronavirus known as COVID-19 occurred causing significant financial market
disruption and social dislocation. The pandemic is dynamic with various cities, counties, states and countries around
the world responding or having responded in different ways to address and contain the outbreak, including the
declaration of a global pandemic by the World Health Organization, a National State of Emergency in the United
States and state and local executive orders and ordinances forcing the closure of non-essential businesses and
persons not employed in or using essential services to “stay at home” or “shelter in place”. At this stage, we have no
certainty as to how long the pandemic, or a more limited epidemic, will last, what regions will be most affected or to
what extent containment measures will be applied.

Imaging centers are healthcare facilities and as such are generally considered an essential service and expected to
continue to operate during any epidemic or pandemic. However, there is potential that actions taken by government,
or referring physicians or individual actions, in response to containment or avoidance of this coronavirus could
impact a patient’s ability or decision to seek imaging services at a given time which could have a significant impact
on volume at our imaging centers leading to temporary or prolonged staff layoffs, reduced hours, closures and other
cost containment efforts. Further, there is potential that certain services which are not urgent and can be deferred
without significant harm to a patient’s health may be delayed, either by us in response to local laws or good public
health practice or voluntarily by the patient. In addition, there is potential that the outbreak of the coronavirus could
impact supply chains, including our supply of personal protective equipment, and lead to personnel shortages, each
of which could impact our ability to safely perform imaging services. It is also possible that social distancing efforts
and sanitization and decontamination procedures could cause delays in the performance of imaging services.
Depending on the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is potential for us to incur incremental
credit losses beyond what is currently expected and potential reduction in revenue and income and asset
impairments.

**_Government Payments_**

During April 2020, we received approximately $1 million under the first appropriation made by HHS to Medicare
providers pursuant to the CARES Act. Additional grants may be available to us through subsequent appropriations
under this program. Further, we received approximately $3 million of accelerated Medicare payments under the
expanded Accelerated and Advance Payments Program from CMS. These payments are to be repaid beginning one
year after their receipt in April through the adjudication of Medicare claims over a future period.


-----

**_Amendment to Existing Credit Agreement_**

The Existing Credit Agreement was amended on June 2, 2020 to, among other things, increase our Existing
Revolving Credit Facility from $50 million to $69 million. Any drawing on our Existing Revolving Credit Facility
that would cause the aggregate principal amount drawn under our Existing Revolving Credit Facility to exceed
$50 million will require the consent of lenders holding more than two-thirds of the outstanding principal amount of
the Term Loan B facility and lenders holding more than two-thirds of the outstanding principal amount of the other
senior credit facilities. As at the date of this offering memorandum, we have approximately $28.4 million drawn
under our Existing Revolving Credit Facility.

In addition, among other things, the amendment adjusted our leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios for the four
quarters ended March 31, 2021, providing us with greater flexibility in meeting our financial ratio covenants. While
no prepayment is required, if a prepayment is made on the Term Loan B facility, an additional premium equal to 2%
of the amount prepaid will need to be paid at the time of prepayment until June 2, 2021 and equal to 1% of the
amount prepaid within the subsequent 12 months.

**_Exercise of Certain RSUs and Warrants_**

As at December 31, 2019, we had 337,500 RSUs outstanding. All of these RSUs vested between January 1, 2020
and March 12, 2020. 285,000 of these RSUs were settled for common shares on March 12, 2020 in accordance with
the terms of the RSU Plan, resulting in 52,500 vested RSUs outstanding as at March 31, 2020. All of the remaining
52,500 RSUs were settled for common shares in accordance with the terms of the RSU Plan during the three-month
period ended June 30, 2020. As at June 30, 2020, we had no RSUs outstanding.

During May 2018, we had issued 525,000 warrants to purchase common shares on a 1:1 basis at an exercise price of
$4.00 per common share. These warrants were not exercised into common shares and expired on May 2, 2020.

**Volume and revenue. RVUs related to service fee revenues in the six-month period ended June 30, 2020 were**
2,619 (in thousands) compared to 2,229 in the six-month period ended June 30, 2019. In fiscal 2019, we completed
an acquisition in Davie, Florida effective April 1, 2019 (the “Davie Acquisition”), the ADG Acquisitions (as defined
herein), an acquisition in Deltona, Florida effective May 31, 2019 (the “Deltona Acquisition”), an acquisition in El
Paso, Texas effective August 16, 2019 (the “El Paso Acquisition”) and an acquisition in West Palm Beach, Florida
effective October 4, 2019 (the “West Palm Beach Acquisition” and, together with the Davie Acquisition, the ADG
Acquisitions, the Deltona Acquisition and the El Paso Acquisition, collectively, the “2019 Acquisitions”). Excluding
the 2019 Acquisitions (except pro-rating for the Davie Acquisition, the Deltona Acquisition and the ADG
Acquisitions) and the 2020 Acquisitions, on a same-center basis, RVUs were 1,864 in the six-month period ended
June 30, 2020 compared to 2,209 in the six-month period ended June 30, 2019, which represents a decrease of
approximately 16%.

Revenue was $124,890 and $101,536 for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The
variance is mainly due to the 2019 Acquisitions and 2020 Acquisitions, partly offset by impact of COVID-19
pandemic. In the six-month period ended June 30, 2020, approximately 32% of service fee revenue was earned from
auto/attorney payors, compared to approximately 18% in the six-month period ended June 30, 2019.

**Employee compensation. Payroll and staffing costs, as a percentage of revenue, decreased from 36% to 33% in the**
six-month period ended June 30, 2020 compared to the six-month period ended June 30, 2019. This decrease is
mainly attributable to the 2019 Acquisitions and 2020 Acquisitions and cost control measures taken in response to
impact of COVID-19 pandemic.

**Reading fees. For the six-month period ended June 30, 2020, reading fees, as a percentage of revenue were 15% and**
for the six-month period ended June 30, 2019, reading fees, as a percentage of revenue were 15%.

**Rent and utilities. For the six-month period ended June 30, 2020 compared to the six-month period ended**
June 30, 2019, rent and utilities increased from 4% of revenue to 5% of revenue. Excluding the impact of IFRS 16,
rent and utilities were 11% of revenue in the six-month period ended June 30, 2020 compared to 10% in the sixmonth period ended June 30, 2019. The increase is mainly due to reductions in revenue arising from COVID-19
pandemic and the relatively fixed nature of rent and utilities expense.

**Third party services and professional fees. For the six-month period ended June 30, 2020, third party services and**
professional fees as a percentage of revenue were 9%, compared to 7% in the six-month period ended June 30, 2019.
This increase is mainly attributable to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on revenues.

**Administrative expenses and medical supplies and other expenses. For the six-month period ended**
June 30, 2020 compared to the six-month period ended June 30, 2019, administrative expenses and medical supplies
and other expenses were approximately 9% and 9% of revenue, respectively. Excluding the impact of IFRS 16, the
administrative expenses and medical supplies were 9% of revenue in the six-month periods ended June 30, 2020 and
9% of revenue in the six-month period ended June 30, 2019.


-----

**Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020 was $28,691 compared to**
$21,542 for the six-month period ended June 30, 2019. The variance is mainly attributable the 2019 Acquisitions
and the 2020 Acquisitions, partly offset by the negative impact of COVID-19 starting in March 2020. Adjusted
EBITDA Margin for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020 was 23% compared to 21% for the six-month period
ended June 30, 2019. The higher margin was mainly due to the 2019 Acquisitions, 2020 Acquisitions and cost
control measures, partly offset by negative impact of COVID-19.

**Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Akumin. The net loss attributable to shareholders of Akumin**
was $1,499 (1% of revenue) for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020 and net income for the six-month period
ended June 30, 2019 was $1,208 (1% of revenue). This decrease in net income is mainly due to disruption to volume
due to COVID-19, partly offset by timing of the above noted 2019 Acquisitions and 2020 Acquisitions, HHS grants
received and gain on revaluation of ADG Acquisition Earn-out liability.

(1) Total debt consists of borrowing under the Existing Loans, subordinated debt, subordinated debt-earn-out, Wesley Chapel Loan, derivative
financial instrument liabilities and leases (including finance leases and other leases), including both the current and non- current portions.

Cash was $28,075 as at June 30, 2020, an increase of $4,686, as compared to $23,389 as at December 31, 2019. The
increase in cash during the six-month period ended June 30, 2020 was due to $14,891 from operating activities,
partly offset by $7,915 used in investing activities and $2,290 used in financing activities.

Accounts receivable were $91,881 as at June 30, 2020, an increase of $9,014, as compared to $82,867 as at
December 31, 2019. This increase is mainly due to lower cash collections due to impact of COVID-19 and 2020
Acquisitions.

As at June 30, 2020, assuming pre-COVID-19 revenue levels, our days of sales outstanding (“DSO”) were
approximately 108 days (approximately 108 days at March 31, 2020). Excluding attorney/auto payors, DSO were
approximately 70 days (approximately 74 days at March 31, 2020). The relative stability in overall DSO is mainly
due to impact of COVID-19 on cash collections, higher proportion of accounts receivable from attorney/auto payors
with a longer collection cycle, continued rationalization of our billing systems and processes, and billing disruption
resulting from our efforts to consolidate the attorney/auto billing team across the Company.

Property and equipment was $204,678 as at June 30, 2020, an increase of $5,054, as compared to $199,624 as at
December 31, 2019. This increase is mainly attributable to property and equipment recognized in the purchase price
allocations for the 2020 Acquisitions (collectively, $4,214), additions to right of use assets ($8,588), and capital
expenditures ($10,730) partly offset by depreciation ($15,745) and net disposals ($2,733).

Intangible assets were $8,033 as at June 30, 2020, a decrease of $1,354, as compared to $9,387 as at
December 31, 2019. This decrease is mainly due to amortization recorded in the period.

Goodwill was $344,023 as at June 30, 2020, an increase of $1,801 of as compared to $342,222 as at
December 31, 2019. This increase is attributable to goodwill recognized from the 2020 Acquisitions (collectively,
$1,675) and working capital settlement adjustments related to 2019 Acquisitions.


-----

Total debt (excluding other lease liabilities) was $367,082 as at June 30, 2020, an increase of $16,646 as compared
to $350,436 as at December 31, 2019. This increase is attributable to increases in the amended Existing Loans
($6,300), non-cash interest accretion and paid-in-kind interest ($2,121), loss on revaluation of derivative financial
instruments liability ($4,238), loss on modification of the amended Existing Loans ($3,125), loss on revaluation of
Subordinated Note – Earn-out ($8) and increase in finance lease liabilities ($5,387), partly offset by loan repayments
($1,851) and debt issuance costs ($2,682).

Our shareholders’ equity was $138,351 as at June 30, 2020, a decrease of $341 as compared to $138,692 as at
December 31, 2019. This decrease is due to net loss of $1,499 earned by us during the six-months ended June 30,
2020, partly offset by stock-based compensation of $1,158.

Non-controlling interests were $3,291 as at June 30, 2020, an increase of $387, as compared to $2,904 as at
December 31, 2019. The non-controlling interests are associated with the acquisition of Preferred Medical Imaging,
LLC effective August 9, 2017 (such acquisition, the “Texas Acquisition”). In the six-month period ended June 30,
2020 net income attributable to the non-controlling interests was $1,101, partly offset by distributions of $714.

During the quarterly periods presented above, we experienced significant RVU growth through acquisitions. The
quarter-to-quarter results have been impacted by the timing of these acquisitions. See “—Recent Developments” and
“—Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results” for additional information.

The table below shows selected non-IFRS financial information on a last twelve-month (“LTM”) basis for the
following periods. All of the following periods include contribution from any acquisition made during the period
only starting from the date of such acquisition. For example, the 2020 Acquisitions are included only from and after
January 1, 2020. Similarly, the 2019 Acquisitions occurred at various times during 2019. As a result, the LTM
period ended June 30, 2020 does not contain a full twelve months contribution from the 2020 Acquisitions or the
2019 Acquisitions, except for the Davie Acquisition. The LTM period ended June 30, 2020 was impacted by
COVID-19 during March 2020 and during the three-month period ended June 30, 2020. We monitor the following
information to measure our overall financial performance.

**Volume and revenue. RVUs related to service fee revenues in the year ended December 31, 2019 were 5,247 (in**
thousands) compared to 3,291 in the year ended December 31, 2018. In fiscal 2018, we completed several
acquisitions (collectively, the “2018 Acquisitions”). In fiscal 2019, we completed the 2019 Acquisitions. Pro-rating
the 2018 Acquisitions and excluding the 2019 Acquisitions, on a same-center basis, RVUs were 3,481 in the year
ended December 31, 2019 compared to 3,276 in the year ended December 31, 2018, which represents an increase of
approximately 6%. We continue to experience volume growth across multiple markets in which we operate.

Revenue was $247,436 and $154,782 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The variance
is mainly due to the 2018 Acquisitions and 2019 Acquisitions. In the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately
25% of service fee revenue was earned from auto/attorney payors, compared to approximately 10% in the year
ended December 31, 2018.

**Employee compensation. Payroll and staffing costs, as a percentage of revenue, decreased from 37% to 35% in the**
year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease is mainly attributable
to the 2018 Acquisitions and 2019 Acquisitions.

**Reading fees. For the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, reading fees,**
as a percentage of revenue, increased from 13% to 14%. This increase is a result of the 2018 and 2019 Acquisitions.


-----

**Rent and utilities. For the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, rent and**
utilities decreased from 11% to 4% of revenue. This decrease is mainly attributable to the adoption of IFRS 16.
Excluding the impact of adoption of IFRS 16, rent and utilities would have been 10% of revenue in the year ended
December 31, 2019.

**Third party services and professional fees. For the year December 31, 2019, third party services and professional**
fees as a percentage of revenue were 8%, compared to 7% in the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase is
mainly attributable to the 2018 Acquisitions and 2019 Acquisitions.

**Administrative expenses and medical supplies and other expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2019**
compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, administrative expenses and medical supplies and other expenses
decreased from 9% to 8% of revenue, partly due to the fixed nature of certain costs and the adoption of IFRS 16.
Excluding the impact of adoption of IFRS 16, the administrative expenses and medical supplies and other expenses
would have been 9% of revenue in the year ended December 31, 2019.

**Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $59,813 compared to $31,775**
for the year ended December 31, 2018. The variance is mainly attributable to the acquisition of all of the outstanding
non-controlling interests in seven of its existing Texas-based diagnostic imaging centers (the “NCI Acquisitions”),
the 2018 Acquisitions, the 2019 Acquisitions and increased contribution from the legacy Florida operations.
Adjusted EBITDA Margin for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 24% compared to 21% for the year ended
December 31, 2018. The higher margin was mainly due to the ADG Acquisitions.

**Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Akumin. The net income attributable to shareholders of Akumin**
was $6,541 (3% of revenue) for the year ended December 31, 2019 and net income for the year ended
December 31,2018 was $5,000 (3% of revenue). This increase in net income is mainly due to timing of the above
noted 2018 Acquisitions and 2019 Acquisitions, partly offset by income tax expense of $2,793 for the year ended
December 31, 2019 compared to an income tax recovery of $1,527 in 2018.

(1) Total debt consists of borrowing under the credit facility, subordinated debt, subordinated debt-earn-out, Wesley Chapel Loan and lease
liabilities (including finance leases and other leases), including both the current and non-current portions.

Cash was $23,389 as at December 31, 2019, an increase of $4,063, as compared to $19,326 as at
December 31, 2018. The increase in cash during the year ended December 31, 2019 was due to $19,859 and
$215,311 provided by operating activities and financing activities, respectively, partly offset by $231,107 used in
investing activities.

Accounts receivable were $82,867 as at December 31, 2019, an increase of $53,056, as compared to $29,811 as at
December 31, 2018. This increase is mainly due to (a) $27,814 of accounts receivable recognized in the purchase
price allocations for acquisitions forming part of the 2018 Acquisitions and the 2019 Acquisitions and (b) growth in
revenue due to 2018 Acquisitions and 2019 Acquisitions.

As at December 31, 2019, our days of sales outstanding (“DSO”) were approximately 98 days (approximately 98
days at September 30, 2019). Excluding attorney/auto payors, DSO were approximately 66 days (approximately 77


-----

days at September 30, 2019). The stability in total DSO and the improvement in the DSO excluding attorney/auto
payors as at December 31, 2019 relative to September 30, 2019, are mainly due to improved collections in the
quarter as we continue to focus on integrating previously announced acquisitions onto our revenue cycle platform.
The stability in total DSO has occurred despite contribution from the following items during the three-month period
ended December 31, 2019 (as compared to the three-month period ended September 30, 2019): (a) higher revenue
contribution mainly due to El Paso Acquisition and West Palm Beach Acquisition; (b) increase in accounts
receivable acquired due to the West Palm Beach Acquisition and (c) higher proportion of revenue mix from
attorney/auto payors with a longer collection cycle, partly offset by collections in the quarter.

Property and equipment was $199,624 as at December 31, 2019, an increase of $144,056, as compared to $55,568 as
at December 31, 2018. This increase is mainly attributable to property and equipment recognized in the purchase
price allocations for Davie Acquisition ($598), ADG Acquisitions ($28,135), Deltona Acquisition ($449), El Paso
Acquisition ($7,606) and West Palm Beach Acquisition (16,058), right of use assets recognized upon adoption of
IFRS 16 ($98,744), additions to right of use assets ($3,585), and capital expenditures ($17,099) partly offset by
depreciation ($26,317) and net disposals ($1,900).

Intangible assets were $9,387 as at December 31, 2019, an increase of $5,718, as compared to $3,669 as at
December 31, 2018. This increase is mainly due to intangible assets recognized in the purchase price allocations for
ADG Acquisitions ($5,870), El Paso Acquisition ($720) and West Palm Beach Acquisition ($1,080), partly offset by
amortization recorded in the period.

Goodwill was $342,222 as at December 31, 2019, an increase of $211,682 of as compared to $130,540 as at
December 31, 2018. This increase is attributable to goodwill recognized from the 2019 Acquisitions, partly offset by
a reduction in goodwill of $5,105 mainly due to accounts receivable recognized in 2019 in the purchase price
allocation for certain of the 2018 Acquisitions.

Total debt (excluding other lease liabilities) was $350,436 as at December 31, 2019, an increase of $232,929 as
compared to $117,507 as at December 31, 2018. This increase is attributable to proceeds from the Existing Loans
($354,114), non-cash interest accretion ($1,928), loss on revaluation upon settlement of the credit agreement dated
August 15, 2018 (the “Syndicated Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of five financial institutions (under the terms
of the Syndicated Credit Agreement, we received a term loan (“Syndicated Term Loan”) of $100,000 (face value)
and a revolving credit facility of $30,000, of which, $11,900 was utilized as of May 30, 2019 (the “Syndicated
Revolving Facility”, and together with the “Syndicated Term Loan”, the “Syndicated Loans”)) and subordinated
note ($1,850), loss on revaluation of derivative financial instruments liability ($952), loss on revaluation of
Subordinated Note – Earn-out ($15) and increase in finance lease liabilities ($4,238), partly offset by loan
repayments ($113,887), repayment of subordinated note ($1,500) and debt issuance costs ($14,781).

Our shareholders’ equity was $138,692 as at December 31, 2019, an increase of $34,754 as compared to $103,938
as at December 31, 2018. This increase is due to issuance of $23,437 in common shares related to the ADG
Acquisitions, $1,311 in warrants exercised, stock-based compensation of $3,555 and net income of $6,451 earned by
us during the year ended December 31, 2019.

Non-controlling interests were $2,904 as at December 31, 2019, an increase of $437, as compared to $2,467 as at
December 31, 2018. The non-controlling interests are associated with the Texas Acquisition. In the year ended
December 31, 2019, net income attributable to the non-controlling interests was $2,200, partly offset by distributions
of $1,763.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

**_General_**

Our objective is to maintain a capital structure that supports its long-term growth strategy, maintains creditor and
customer confidence, and maximizes shareholder value.

Our capital structure consists of capital stock, warrants, contributed surplus and debt.


-----

Our primary uses of capital are to finance operations, increase non-cash working capital and capital expenditures.
Our objectives when managing capital are to ensure we will continue to have enough liquidity so we can provide our
services to our customers and returns to our shareholders. As we have primarily grown through acquisitions, we
have raised debt and equity to partly finance such transactions. The details regarding such issuances are noted in our
condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30,
2020.

As at June 30, 2020, we had cash of $28,075.

As at June 30, 2020, we had $367,082 of senior loans payable, derivative financial instruments liability,
Subordinated Note – Earn-out (as defined below) and finance lease liabilities. As of June 30, 2020, $6,306 of these
liabilities are due within one year.

Substantially all of our assets are pledged as security for senior loans. We are subject to certain financial
performance debt covenants and we are currently in compliance with them.

As at June 30, 2020, we had other lease liabilities of $135,322, consisting mainly of leases with remaining term of
more than one year, primarily for office space. As of June 30, 2020, $9,692 of these liabilities are due within one
year. As at June 30, 2020, we had finance lease liabilities of $13,803. As of June 30, 2020, $2,590 of these liabilities
are due within one year.

We believe that our current sources of liquidity and capital will be sufficient to finance our continued operations,
growth strategy and additional expenses we expect to incur for at least the next 12 months. We have in the past
financed our growth through acquisitions via privately issued capital in the equity and/or debt markets and publicly
issued equity and we expect to continue to do so. We expect to gain additional access to the public equity and/or
debt capital markets to support our growth strategy. There can be no assurance, however, that our business will
generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available under our credit facility or
otherwise to enable us to service our indebtedness, or to make capital expenditures in the future. Our future
operating performance and our ability to service or extend our indebtedness, will be subject to future economic
conditions and to financial, business, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. See “Risk Factors”
for additional information.

**Lending Arrangements and Debt**

**_Amended Existing Loans_**

On June 2, 2020, we entered into an amendment to our senior credit agreement which amended the credit agreement
signed effective May 31, 2019. Under the terms of the Existing Credit Agreement, as amended, we received in
May 2019 a term loan A and term loan B of $66,000 and $266,000, respectively (face value) and a revolving credit
facility of $50,000, which was increased to $69,000 on June 2, 2020. Sixteen million dollars of the Term Loan A
was subject to a delayed draw, which was drawn by us in October 2019 to partly finance the West Palm Beach
Acquisition. The term of the Existing Term Loans is five years from May 31, 2019. The Existing Term Loans can be
increased by an additional $100,000 subject to certain conditions. The proceeds of the Existing Term Loans were
used during 2019 to settle the Syndicated Loans for $112,482, the principal outstanding under Subordinated Note
and related accrued and unpaid interest for $1,596, partly finance the ADG Acquisitions and Deltona Acquisition in
May 2019 and pay related debt issuance costs. As at December 31, 2019, the Existing Term Loans had a balance of
approximately, $339.4 million. In June 2020, the amendment costs related to the Existing Credit Agreement were
netted against the balance of the Existing Term Loans. The above-noted amendment to the senior credit agreement
in June 2020 was considered debt modification for accounting purposes and a loss of approximately $3.1 million
was recognized as a result of this amendment in the condensed interim consolidated statements of net income (loss)
and comprehensive income (loss). As at June 30, 2020, the Existing Term Loans had a face value of approximately
$361.6 million (amortized cost of approximately, $346.6 million).

**_Wesley Chapel Loan_**

We, through a subsidiary, have a purchase money secured loan (the “Wesley Chapel Loan”) of $2,000 (face value)
as of August 15, 2018 which was used to finance the purchase of equipment and related installation for a new clinic


-----

location around Tampa Bay, Florida. It has an annual interest rate of 5.0%, matures on August 15, 2023, has
monthly repayments of $38 and is secured only against the equipment financed. The Wesley Chapel Loan was
recognized at fair value of $1,908 on August 15, 2018 using an effective interest rate. As of June 30, 2020, the face
value of the Wesley Chapel Loan was $1,324 (amortized cost of $1,266).

**_Subordinated Note Payable – Earn-out_**

As part of an acquisition, our wholly-owned indirect subsidiary assumed a subordinated 6% note and security
agreement with the seller’s secured lender on May 11, 2018 (the “Subordinated Note”) with a face value of $1,500
and a term of four years. The Subordinated Note was recognized at fair value of $1,491 on May 11, 2018 using an
effective interest rate. According to the Subordinated Note agreement, the interest on the Subordinated Note is
accrued and added to the principal amount on each anniversary of the Subordinated Note agreement.

In accordance with the terms of the Subordinated Note, we used part of the proceeds of the Existing Term Loans to
settle the principal outstanding under Subordinated Note on May 31, 2019 together with accrued and unpaid interest,
for $1,596 (face value of $1,500 and accrued interest of $96). We also recorded a fair value loss of $7 on the
extinguishment of the Subordinated Note, which was reflected in the consolidated statements of net income (loss)
and comprehensive income (loss).

The principal balance of the Subordinated Note is subject to increase by an earn-out (the “Subordinated Note—
Earn-out”) of up to an additional $4.0 million during the three-calendar year period beginning on January 1, 2019
and ending on December 31, 2021, subject to the satisfaction of certain revenue-based milestones. Management
estimated the fair value of the Subordinated Note – Earn-out as at May 11, 2018 of $161. The Subordinated Note—
Earn-out was revalued at $192 as at June 30, 2020 and the change in fair value was recognized in the condensed
interim consolidated statement of net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss).

**_ADG Acquisition – Earn-out_**

A portion of the purchase price payable in respect of our acquisition of our Georgia business on May 31, 2019, is
subject to an earn-out (the “ADG Acquisition Earn-out”) based on its annualized revenues earned in the first two
quarters of 2020 less certain costs including certain operating expenses, capital expenditures and incremental
working capital. In accordance with the purchase agreement, 50% of this liability is expected to be settled in the
latter half of 2020 and the balance in the first half of 2021.

Management estimated the fair value of the ADG Acquisition Earn-out liability as at May 31, 2019 at approximately
$15 million. Subsequently, the ADG Acquisition – earn-out liability estimate was revalued at approximately
$15 million as at December 31, 2019 and at approximately $8 million as at March 31, 2020 and the respective
changes in fair value were recognized in financial instruments revaluation in the related consolidated statements of
net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss). The ADG Acquisition Earn-out liability estimate was revalued
at approximately $6.2 million as at June 30, 2020 and the change in fair value was recognized in the condensed
interim consolidated statements of net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss). The final value of the ADG
Acquisition Earn-out is subject to review by the sellers of the Georgia business in accordance with the terms of the
purchase agreement between the parties.

**Financial Instruments**

Our financial instruments consist of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, Existing
Term Loans, Wesley Chapel Loan, Subordinated Note – Earn-out, ADG Acquisition Earn-out, leases and derivative
financial instruments. The fair values of these financial instruments, except the Existing Loans, Wesley Chapel
Loan, Subordinated Note – Earn-out, ADG Acquisition Earn-out, and the derivative financial instruments,
approximate carrying value because of their short-term nature. The carrying value of the non-current portion of
leases approximates their fair value given the difference between the discount rates used to recognize the liabilities
in the consolidated balance sheets and the normalized expected market rates of interest is insignificant. Effective
November 14, 2018, we entered into a derivative financial instrument contract with a financial institution in order to
mitigate interest rate risk under the variable interest rate Syndicated Loans. The derivative financial instrument is an
interest rate cap rate of 3.75% (LIBOR) per annum on a notional amount of 50% of the face value of the Syndicated
Term Loan ($50,000 as of November 14, 2018). The termination date of this arrangement is August 31, 2021.


-----

In addition, effective July 31, 2019, we entered into a further derivative financial instrument, an interest rate collar
contract (which was most recently amended in February 2020), with a financial institution in order to mitigate
interest rate risk under the Existing Term Loans. This derivative financial instrument has an underlying notional
amount of 100% of the face value of Term Loan B ($266,000 as at July 31, 2019) and a termination date of July 31,
2022 with (i) a cap rate of 3.00% (LIBOR) per annum and (ii) a floor rate of 1.1475% (LIBOR) per annum.

Financial assets measured at amortized cost include cash and accounts receivable. Financial liabilities measured at
amortized cost include accounts payable and accrued liabilities, leases, Existing Term Loans and Wesley Chapel
Loan. Amortization is recorded using the effective interest rate method. We classify the derivative financial
instruments as financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. We classify the Subordinated Note –
Earn-out and ADG Acquisition Earn-out, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.

Our financial instruments are exposed to certain financial risks including credit risk, liquidity risk, currency risk and
interest rate risk. Refer to note 17 of our December 31, 2019 consolidated financial statements for further discussion
regarding risk management arising from financial instruments. There have been no significant changes to those risks
impacting us since December 31, 2019, nor has there been a significant change in the composition of our financial
instruments since December 31, 2019.

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019:

**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**

We have not engaged in any off-balance sheet financing transactions except for letters of credit related to facilities
leases of approximately $100 as at June 30, 2020.

**Share Information**

As of the date of this offering memorandum, we have 70,178,428 common shares issued and outstanding. If all of
our stock options that have been issued and are outstanding pursuant to our stock option plan were to be exercised,
including options that are not yet exercisable, we would be required to issue up to an additional 5,767,120 common
shares, or approximately 8.22% of our issued and outstanding common shares as of the date of this offering
memorandum on a non-diluted basis.

As of the date of this offering memorandum, there are no RSUs or warrants outstanding.

**Related Party Transactions**

In the normal course of business, we engage in transactions with our wholly owned and controlled subsidiaries.
Balances and transactions between us and our wholly owned and controlled subsidiaries have been eliminated on
consolidation in our consolidated financial statements.

We transact with key individuals from management who have the authority to plan, direct, and control our activities,
including through employment agreements and stock-based compensation plans. Key management personnel are


-----

defined as our executive officers and the board of directors, including the President and Chief Executive Officer,
Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Secretary and Senior
Vice Presidents. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions”.

**Critical Accounting Estimates**

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Actual results could
differ from these estimates. As additional information becomes available or actual amounts are determinable, the
recorded estimates are revised and reflected in operating results in the period in which they are determined.

**Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses**

Accounts receivable are recognized initially at net realizable value and subsequently measured at amortized cost less
loss allowances. During the six-month period ended June 30, 2020, we applied the simplified approach to measure
expected credit losses, permitted by IFRS 9, which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all accounts
receivable.

Accounts receivable are considered to be in default when customers have failed to make the contractually required
payments when due. A provision for credit losses is recorded as a reduction in revenue with an offsetting amount
recorded as an allowance for credit losses, reducing the carrying value of the receivable. When a receivable is
considered uncollectible, the receivable is written off against the allowance for credit losses account.

**Impairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets**

Management tests at least annually whether goodwill suffered any impairment. Property and equipment are
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be
recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately
identifiable cash flows.

Management makes key assumptions and estimates in determining the recoverable amount of our cash generating
units (“CGUs”) or groups of CGUs, including future cash flows based on historical and budgeted operating results,
growth rates, tax rates and appropriate after-tax discount rates.

We evaluate our long-lived assets (property and equipment) and intangible assets, other than goodwill, for
impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. The accounting standards require that if the sum of the
undiscounted expected future cash flows from a long-lived asset or definite-lived intangible asset is less than the
carrying value of that asset, an asset impairment charge must be recognized. The amount of the impairment charge is
calculated as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value, which generally represents the discounted
future cash flows from that asset.

**Income Taxes**

We are subject to government audits and the outcome of such audits may differ from original estimates.
Management believes that a sufficient amount has been accrued for income taxes. Further, management evaluates
the realizability of the net deferred tax assets and assesses the valuation allowance periodically. If future taxable
income or other factors are not consistent with our expectations, an adjustment to our allowance for net deferred tax
assets may be required. For net deferred tax assets, we consider estimates of future taxable income, including tax
planning strategies, in determining whether net deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized.

**Business Combinations**

Significant judgment is required in identifying tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of acquired businesses,
as well as determining their fair values. We apply the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The
consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities


-----

incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by us. The consideration transferred
includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable
assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at
their fair values at the acquisition date. We recognize any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at fair value of the
recognized amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.

**Contractual Allowances**

Net patient service revenue is reported at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients, third party payors, and
others for services rendered and recognized in the period in which the services are performed. Net patient service
revenue is recorded based on established billing rates, less estimated discounts for contractual allowances.
Contractual adjustments result from the differences between the established rates charged for services performed
and expected reimbursements by government-sponsored healthcare programs and other payors for such services.

**Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting**

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures to
provide reasonable assurance that all material information relating to us is gathered and reported to senior
management on a timely basis so that appropriate decisions can be made regarding public disclosure. Management is
also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial reports for
external purposes in accordance with IFRS. In designing such controls, it should be recognized that due to inherent
limitations, any controls, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of
achieving the desired control objectives and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Additionally, management is
required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures.


-----

**BUSINESS**

**Business Overview**

We are a leading provider of outpatient diagnostic imaging services in the United States, with 128 freestanding,
fixed-site outpatient diagnostic imaging centers. Our centers provide physicians with imaging capabilities to
facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of diseases and disorders in order to help reduce unnecessary invasive
procedures, determine the appropriate amount of care and minimize cost for patients. Our services include magnetic
resonance imaging (“MRI”), computed tomography (“CT”), positron emission tomography (“PET”), ultrasound, Xray, mammography as well as other diagnostic and interventional radiology procedures.

We seek to develop leading positions in regional markets in order to leverage operational efficiencies. Our 128
centers are located in seven states, including: Florida (72), Texas (24), Pennsylvania (14), Delaware (8), Georgia (6),
Illinois (3), and Kansas (1). Our scale and density within selected geographies in the United States drives long-term
relationships with key payors, radiology groups and referring physicians. Our operations team is dedicated to
meeting our standards of patient care, managing relationships with local physicians and payors and improving
profitability. We provide corporate training programs, standardize policies and procedures and share best practices
among the physicians in our regional networks so that they can be implemented.

Our scalable and integrated operating platform supports our ability to drive organic growth, realize cost efficiencies
and create value from integrating acquisitions. Strategic acquisitions and organic growth have helped us strengthen
our position in core geographies. Since our inception, we have successfully integrated more than 100 outpatient
diagnostic imaging centers into our platform. In our highly fragmented market, we are the second largest publicly
traded provider of outpatient diagnostic imaging services, with the top 5 operators representing approximately 12%
of total U.S. outpatient imaging centers. We believe our scale and track record of being able to achieve material cost
synergies enable us to successfully compete for acquisitions against smaller operators in overlapping markets and
potential new entrants in markets where we have an existing presence.

Substantially all of our revenue is derived, directly or indirectly, from fees charged for diagnostic imaging services
performed at our centers. This stream of revenue is diversified across multiple geographies, mixed modality
offerings and a number of different payors. We report volume of diagnostic imaging procedures based on relative
value units (“RVUs”). RVUs are a standard measure of value used in the U.S. Medicare reimbursement formula for
physician services. Our RVUs in the twelve-month period ended June 30, 2020 were 5.637 million compared to
4.098 million in the twelve-month period ended June 30, 2019. Furthermore, RVUs in the three-month period ended
September 30, 2020 are expected to be approximately 1.485 million. Although RVUs for the three-month period
ended September 30, 2020 are not yet finalized, this estimate reflects our preliminary expectations for RVUs for the
period based on information currently available to us. The below charts provide the breakdown of our RVUs across
modalities and payors for the last twelve-month period ended June 30, 2020:


**Modality and Payor Mix (by RVUs)**


-----

For the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, our net revenues were $271 million and Adjusted EBITDA was $67
million. Normalized for the impact of COVID-19, based on annualizing our RVUs for the three month period ended
September 30, 2020, we believe we would have had net revenues of $285 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $74
million for the twelve-month period ended June 30, 2020. See “—Recent Developments—COVID-19” and
“Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information and Other Data” for a reconciliation of
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Normalized for COVID-19 to the most comparable IFRS measure.

**Industry Overview**

**_Essential Healthcare Service Industry Poised for Consolidation_**

Outpatient diagnostic imaging centers are primarily used to provide internal imaging services to patients referred by
a third-party physician. Standard offerings include imaging procedures such as X-ray and ultrasound along with
more complex and costly services, such as MRI, CT, PET and mammography in addition to other diagnostic and
interventional radiology procedures. By providing diagnostic imaging services in a more cost effective setting
compared to traditional hospitals, outpatient diagnostic imaging centers are able to cater to the diverse needs of their
markets and in turn, have become one of the fastest growing sectors in healthcare.

The size of the freestanding outpatient diagnostic imaging market in the United States is estimated at more than $19
billion in annual industry revenue. The diagnostic imaging market is highly competitive, consisting of owneroperator radiologists, freestanding outpatient diagnostic imaging centers and hospitals. We also face competition
from other diagnostic imaging companies in acquiring diagnostic imaging centers. According to publicly available
sources, there are estimated to be more than 6,000 freestanding outpatient diagnostic imaging centers in the United
States. The landscape in the outpatient diagnostic imaging industry is highly fragmented. This fragmentation is
evidenced by the top 5 players representing only approximately 12% of the total market share of outpatient imaging
centers, a prime indicator of market consolidation potential. Akumin’s primary competitors in terms of scale are
RadNet, CDI and SimonMed Imaging.

We believe the outpatient diagnostic imaging industry will remain stable for the foreseeable future. Contributing to
this outlook is the expectation of stable Medicare reimbursement rates, increasing imaging volumes and growing
acceptance of imaging procedures. Since becoming a mainstream medical diagnostic mechanism in the 1990’s, the
utilization of diagnostic imaging has drastically increased. Over the last few decades, the imaging industry has
developed significantly through improvements in technology, the development of various imaging venues
(outpatient vs. hospital), and the continued increase in the number of patients seeking out imaging procedures.

Large outpatient imaging center operators, such as Akumin, are in a position to benefit from these industry
dynamics. Scale, reputation and operating excellence will likely be key drivers of performance for the various
industry players.

**_Stable Pricing Environment_**

After a downward trend in reimbursement from 2007 to 2014, Medicare reimbursements have generally stabilized.
From 2015 to 2020, there has been limited fluctuation in reimbursements. The stabilized reimbursement
environment has allowed operators to accurately forecast their financial needs and more appropriately run their
operations.


-----

**Figure 1: Top 5 MRI CPT Codes**


**_Freestanding Imaging is an Attractive Alternative to Hospitals_**

The gap in pricing between traditional hospital and freestanding outpatient facilities has increased over time. In
effect, this has caused a shift in policy for payors. In an effort to curtail costs, commercial payors, specifically
Anthem and United Healthcare, have begun to transition away from traditional hospital imaging and move towards
recommending, or in some cases, requiring imaging to take place at outpatient facilities. In 2017, Anthem
announced it would no longer fund various advanced imaging procedures at hospital-based facilities due to the
substantial price difference between hospital-based procedures and outpatient-based procedures. UnitedHealthcare’s
policy now requires a site-of-care authorization prior to the imaging procedures taking place. As commercial and
government payors continue to squeeze budgets and healthcare costs continue to rise, this gap is expected to
continue to increase.

Historical pricing pressures from government and commercial payors, along with increased requirements for preauthorization of advanced diagnostic procedures (in an effort to ensure the medical necessity of tests in the United
States and to enforce national clinical guidelines for imaging services) are expected to help drive some procedure
volume from hospitals to freestanding outpatient facilities. Moreover, the combination of pricing pressure and
favorable volume outlook for outpatient imaging centers have facilitated consolidation in the sector and created a
favorable environment for operators of scale.

**Favorable Market Tailwinds**

**_Aging Demographics_**

The population aged 65 years and older in the United States is expected to increase significantly, largely owing to
the subset of aging baby boomers. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the “65+” population will outnumber
individuals under the age of 18 by 2034. As the overall U.S. population continues to age, the need for affordable and
easily accessible healthcare procedures will expand proportionally. According to the U.S. Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services, senior citizens, defined as those who are 65 years old or older, made up only 13% of the total
U.S. population, yet accounted for 34% of healthcare-related spending. The vast growth in the elderly population is
expected to positively impact the financial landscape of the overall healthcare industry.

**_Greater Consumer Awareness for Earlier Intervention and Preventative Screening_**

Greater consumer awareness for early intervention, increased emphasis on preventive screening and many
technological advances have changed the perception of imaging from a luxury service to an essential part of the
diagnostic process. Additionally, we believe that further technological advancements will allow for even earlier
diagnosis of diseases and disorders through less invasive methods, further driving demand for diagnostic imaging
services.

There is significant benefit for patients and payors in stopping a health issue before it begins. As such, commercial
payors have continued to shift their views of imaging procedures towards encouraging and allowing further


-----

preventative screenings to help cut costs in the long run. Additionally, the industry is seeing a shift towards the
adoption of innovative technology in areas such as Artificial Intelligence (“AI”)which has the potential to transform
diagnostic imaging and help with early diagnosis.

**Competitive Strengths**

**_Leading Outpatient Diagnostic Imaging Provider in the United States_**

We pride ourselves on our commitment to excellence and were founded with a focus on helping today’s healthcare
consumers become more active participants in managing their health. Akumin leverages its combined clinical
experience and the latest advances in technology and information systems, to offer hospital-level expertise within a
local setting. Through education, innovation and patient engagement, we have become one of the leading providers
of outpatient diagnostic imaging services in the United States. Akumin strives to provide quality service, short wait
and turnaround times and convenience to all patients. As at June 30, 2020, we operated 128 imaging centers,
entrenching our position as the second largest publicly traded provider of diagnostic imaging services in the United
States.

As Akumin continues to grow, we will continue to experience enhanced benefits of scale such as unlocking
additional physician referrals in markets with center network density and enabling stronger partnerships with payors.
This will help further drive growth and margins while creating even more operating leverage with a centralized
management team and service delivery.

The following table shows the number of Akumin diagnostic imaging facilities as of the dates indicated:


**As at**

Number of Diagnostic Imaging
Facilities ..................................... 128 129 96 74

**_Stable and Diversified Revenue Base_**

Akumin benefits from a well-diversified stream of revenues that span multiple geographies, modality offerings and
physician networks. We operate diagnostic imaging centers in 7 states, each located in densely populated
metropolitan areas. Each market leverages a network of radiologists with some radiologists working on-site and
others working remotely. Given our vast network of radiologists and dynamic IT platform, we do not rely heavily on
any single radiologist to drive business. Our scale and density within selected geographies allows us to create close,
long-term relationships with local radiology groups and referring physicians.

Our multi-modality imaging offering provides a one-stop-shop for patients and referring physicians. MRI, CT and
ultrasound accounted for 78% of total RVUs generated by us in the twelve-month period ended June 30, 2020. MRI
and CT offer higher margins resulting in our attractive modality mix. Further, as imaging becomes standard in
preventive screenings, MRI, CT and ultrasound will become more commonplace. The remaining modalities offered
are typically utilized for specific purposes on a case-by-case basis.

Akumin enjoys a diversified payor mix which leverages relationships with major commercial payors and important
federally funded programs such as Medicare. Substantially all of our revenues are derived from in-network
providers. We are able to leverage our scale and density in core markets to partner with payors looking for low-cost
imaging alternatives to traditional hospitals.

We believe we are the ideal imaging partner for payors who seek to provide high quality care to patients at a low
cost. By partnering with the vast majority of all major payors in our geographic footprint, we are able to provide
significant savings to our payor partners by ensuring patients stay within their networks using our system of
conveniently located facilities. Payor reimbursement levels are negotiated via contracts with each individual payor.
These contracts allow for separate reimbursement schedules for each of the payor’s respective clients, depending on
the members’ individual coverage plan.


-----

**_Proven Growth Strategy_**

We have deployed a growth strategy that drives growth via both organic and inorganic means. Our organic growth
strategy is based on a marketing platform which utilizes relationships with local referring physicians to drive new
business. Additionally, in markets with robust demand, we will consider adding modalities in centers that are
currently only single or dual modality centers. Multi-modality centers help diversify risk while contributing
positively to our margins. To attain growth and offer a competitive differentiator in key markets, we will also
consider replacing or adding new technologies and equipment. While reimbursement rates may not change with
newer equipment, we believe this strategy will offer us a market advantage which will ultimately lead to increased
volumes. An example of this is our investment in 3D digital mammography, which is now being reimbursed by
many of the large national insurance payors in addition to Medicare.

Akumin stresses the importance of operational excellence which ultimately manifests itself in shorter wait times. In
an effort to capitalize on organic growth opportunities, we employ a marketing strategy that places the utmost
importance on relationships with third-party referring physicians. Referring physicians drive a material portion of
our revenues. To ensure the continued strength of relationships with referring physicians, we employ a marketing
team whose primary responsibility is establishing new relationships and maintaining existing relationships with
referring physicians. Relationships with new referring physicians are developed through our value proposition (i.e.
consistent service, contracts with substantially all payors, convenience and access to top subspecialty radiologists).
Existing relationships are maintained by ensuring we continue to deliver our value proposition in a consistent
manner.

The table above shows year-over-year RVU growth on a same-center basis excluding the 2020 Acquisitions (as
defined below) and the 2019 Acquisitions (as defined below), except for the Davie Acquisition and pro-rating for
the Deltona Acquisition and the ADG Acquisitions (each as defined below).

**_Incremental Benefits of Organic Growth_**

We are able to further drive profitability by leveraging our scale to further improve margins. The following
operating costs, as disclosed in our financial statements, are variable or semi-variable in nature: employee
compensations (as organic growth does not require additions to certain corporate and back office functions), reading
fees, medical supplies and other expenses. These costs, in the aggregate, make up 51% of net revenue on a LTM
basis as of June 30, 2020. Given the variable and semi-variable nature of these cost components, we believe that
$1.00 of additional organic revenue growth at our existing imaging centers generates a minimum of approximately
$0.49 of incremental Adjusted EBITDA growth with the potential for higher margin contribution given the semivariable nature of employee compensation.

**_Well Positioned as a High Growth Consolidator_**

The outpatient diagnostic imaging market in the United States is highly fragmented. According to publicly available
sources, there are estimated to be more than 6,000 outpatient diagnostic imaging centers operating in the United
States. The top 5 players by number of centers represent approximately 12% of the total U.S. outpatient imaging
centers.


-----

Changing legislation and regulation are expected to impact spending in the healthcare sector. As a result, the
industry is expecting insurance providers to consolidate, leading to fewer, large insurance providers with more
bargaining power. Small imaging operators will see margins tighten providing an opportunity for large consolidators
to acquire assets at attractive valuations. Akumin’s scale, reputation and successful history of integrating
acquisitions makes it the ideal partner for smaller imaging operators.

The increasing barriers to entry limit access to the market for new entrants due to the limited desire from payors to
enter into new network contracts, high startup costs associated with opening new freestanding imaging centers, the
continued significant capital investment required for maintaining and upgrading equipment, and the increasing costs
of regulatory compliance.

**_Proven Acquisition Strategy_**

Our acquisition strategy is led by our President and Chief Executive Officer, Riadh Zine. Mr. Zine has grown Akumin
through a carefully executed, highly acquisitive, strategy based on a distinct set of criteria: (i) market density,
(ii) market growth potential, (iii) operational integration potential, (iv) assets and compliance assessment, and
(v) attractive valuation multiples. Of the multiple factors, market density plays the most significant role. We look to
acquire individual or portfolios of centers that have a meaningful presence in their respective market. An increased
geographic footprint improves our ability to partner with commercial payors. We expect to focus our acquisition
growth in markets where we currently maintain a significant foothold; however, acquisitions of material size in new
markets remain possible. Once we have gained market density, management begins dialogue with smaller local
operators to build trust over time and establish the foundation for attractive future in-market, tuck-in acquisitions.

**_Value from Integrating Acquisitions_**

The consumer is at the heart of our strategy as increasing out of pocket costs are changing consumer behavior in
healthcare services. For example, the percentage of U.S. workers enrolled in high deductible plans with a health
savings account increased from approximately 4% in 2007 to approximately 19% in 2017. Our commitment to
operational excellence and service delivery optimizes the consumer’s experience at our clinics.

We provide a consistent customer experience, standardized through technology and investments in our people and
processes. All patient facing employees are trained on delivering the Akumin brand, which strives to provide
engaging, innovative and inclusive services to all. After appropriate integration periods following acquisitions,
individual centers are expected to be designed for remodel with interiors and signage expected to be put in place to
conform with the standard Akumin facility design.

Our branding strategy is focused on aligning our position in the market in the space between traditional hospitals
and outpatient clinics. By combining the best qualities of these diagnostic imaging providers, we hope to become the
go-to provider of outpatient diagnostic imaging services to all patients in our service areas. We strive to provide
shorter waiting times, convenient locations, competitive fees, quality equipment and software, subspecialty
radiologists and top-tier expertise and consistency.

As we continue to scale our operations, cost synergies associated with each acquisition will become more impactful.

**_Strong Alignment of Interest_**

We have assembled a management team with extensive experience and deep-domain expertise in all aspects:
Operations, Finance, Legal & Compliance, Revenue Cycle Management, Clinical Development, Technology
Solutions, and Branding & Business Development.

The equity ownership of our directors and officers provides strong alignment of interests with all stakeholders given
focus on long term value creation. In addition, equity has been issued in the past to fund larger acquisitions. Issuing
equity reduces the leverage risks relating to the acquisition growth strategy and helps maintain a flexible capital
structure and manageable leverage ratios.


-----

**Business Strategy**

**_Diverse Service Offerings Centered on Patient Needs_**

As consumerism continues to emerge in healthcare, we are committed to putting the patient at the center of our
brand strategy. We plan to continue to organize our service offerings based upon patient needs. This may include
specialty imaging, women’s imaging needs and personal injury imaging in addition to traditional imaging needs. By
providing these service offerings, we are able to more closely relate to our consumers and be responsive to their
needs. This strategy also has the benefit of expanding revenue streams and diversifying market segments and
consumer demand.

We place a high emphasis on these broad service offerings and providing access to multi-modality procedures.
Doing so allows us to become a one-stop shop for patients, referring physicians and payors, giving them access to
full slate of imaging procedures through a modality mix which includes: MRI, CT, PET/CT, ultrasound,
Mammography, bone density (DEXA), x-ray and other screening, diagnostic or interventional procedures.

**_Focus on Service Delivery & Operations_**

Our entrepreneurial culture promotes innovation. We intend to continue to invest in technology to help strengthen
our infrastructure, workflow processes and centralized data information platforms. We are standardizing our
transaction workflow process in order to provide an efficient and effective service for all parties involved. Our
centralized platforms and back office functions are improving service delivery and are decreasing the administrative
burden placed on our centers. The ultimate goal is a consistent consumer experience across our service offerings on
the Akumin platform.

**_Prioritizing Clinical Outcomes_**

Standardizing clinical protocols is also a priority for Akumin to ensure consistent patient care and radiologist
efficiency. In addition, the radiology industry is adopting AI as a means of supporting radiologists’ ability to
identify and monitor critical findings for our patients. We intend to connect our operating systems to these AI tools
and libraries to improve clinical outcomes. We also hope to improve the overall experience of care for patients to
provide not just diagnostic but also increased screening procedures so that more patients learn about their health
risks and predispositions, and consequently we can help prevent disease in the first place.

Further, we also plan to invest in advanced software and equipment to provide the latest available procedures.
These upgrades not only help provide consistent service, they also provide an attractive return on investment
through increased volumes as a result of increased referrals and efficiency.

**_Maintaining Strong Relationships with Referring Physicians, Radiologists and Payors_**

We maintain strong relationships with referring physicians as they are the source of our patients and therefore our
revenue base. Providing a consistent level of service, quick turnaround time for radiology reports, and timely access
to relevant information are key to maintaining a strong relationship with referring physicians.

We engage large pools of radiologists, many of whom are fellowship trained subspecialty radiologists, located in or
near to the markets we serve. We build relationships with these subspecialty trained radiologists, who are generally
compensated on a per-read basis. Our relationships with subspecialty trained radiologists ensure proper coverage in
our markets and that radiology reports can be provided within our required service standards. Contracts are
negotiated with individual radiologists and radiology groups on a stand-alone basis, meaning that the Company does
not have a standard per-read price.

Akumin builds relationships with payors in each state it serves by looking to build density in multiple markets in
each state. This strategy makes us relevant to those payors and allows us to provide a low cost, reliable imaging
provider solution for those payors and their members.


-----

**_Disciplined Organic and Acquisition Growth_**

We have a strategic and thoughtful approach to growth that is focused on profitability over the long term. Our
future growth will be comprised of organic growth as well as opportunistic acquisitions. Organic growth will be a
combination of marketing and operational initiatives to increase volumes in our existing clinics, introducing new
service offerings in our key markets and opening new centers where supported by consumer demand. We expect the
near term focus of our acquisition growth will be in the markets where we currently maintain a significant foothold.

**Affiliated Physicians Groups**

In some states, our Company is affiliated with medical practices organized in traditional practice group structures
which operate certain of our imaging clinics. In accordance with applicable state laws, these affiliated practice
groups are responsible for the provision of medical care to patients at the imaging centers operated by those
affiliated practice groups. Most of our other imaging centers are organized as independent diagnostic testing
facilities or “IDTFs”. Our affiliated practice groups are separate legal entities organized under state law generally as
limited liability companies but could also be organized as business corporations, professional associations,
professional corporations or partnerships. Each of our affiliated physician groups is owned by one or more licensed
physicians affiliated with the Company through employment or another contractual relationship.

Our affiliated physician practices employ or engage radiologists and other medical professionals to provide clinical
services at certain of our imaging centers. In most of our affiliated physician groups, the physicians who own the
equity in the affiliated physician group have entered into a contractual relationship with the Company which provide
for restrictions on the transfer of such equity interest.

Further, many states have laws that prohibit or restrict the ability for business corporations, like Akumin, from
practicing medicine, employing physicians to practice medicine, exercising control over medical decisions by
physicians, or engaging in certain arrangements, such as fee splitting, with physicians. In light of these restrictions,
we operate certain of our imaging centers by maintaining long-term administrative management services contracts
through our subsidiaries with affiliated physician groups. Under the terms of these services contracts, our subsidiary
has been engaged as the exclusive manager and provider of the affiliated physician group’s administrative and nonclinical affairs. Subject to applicable state laws and other regulations, our subsidiary provides services as manager
for the affiliated physician group, which services typically include billing patients and third-party payors, providing
and maintaining medical equipment and, procuring non-clinical staff and performing other back-office
administrative services. Under the terms of our management agreements with the affiliated physician groups,
Akumin, or its affiliate, is typically paid for its services based on the performance of the applicable affiliated
physician group. Our subsidiaries do not represent that they offer medical services and do not exercise influence or
control over the practice of medicine by the physicians employed or engaged by the affiliated physician groups.

We, directly or indirectly, have exclusive management of the administrative and non-clinical affairs of the following
affiliated physician groups (as defined below) and the table below sets forth their respective jurisdictions of
incorporation or formation, as the case may be:

**Name of Affiliated Physician Group** **Jurisdiction of Incorporation/Formation**

**Acquisitions**

_Preferred Medical Imaging_ – On August 9, 2017, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding equity interests in
Preferred Medical Imaging, LLC (“Akumin Texas”) for $94 million. Akumin Texas, through its wholly-owned,
controlled and managed subsidiaries, operates diagnostic imaging centers predominantly in the Dallas-Fort Worth,
Texas area, as well as additional diagnostic imaging centers in other parts of Texas, in Chicago, Illinois and in
Wichita, Kansas. The acquisition included the acquisition by Akumin Texas of all of the issued and outstanding
equity interests in SyncMed, LLC, which operates a medical equipment maintenance business which exclusively
serves Akumin Texas and its subsidiaries.

_West Florida Acquisition – On May 11, 2018, we acquired four diagnostic imaging centers in and around the_
Tampa, Florida area, commencing operations on Florida’s west coast.


-----

_Texas Non-Controlling Interest Acquisition – On May 24, 2018, the Company, through Akumin Texas, acquired all_
of the outstanding non-controlling interests in seven of its existing Texas-based diagnostic imaging centers for an
aggregate purchase price of approximately $21.6 million, of which approximately $17.9 million was paid in cash
and the balance of approximately $3.7 million was paid by the issuance of common shares.

_Rose Radiology Acquisition – On August 15, 2018, we acquired the assets of eleven diagnostic imaging centers_
operated by Rose Radiology Centers, Inc. (“Rose Radiology”) on Florida’s west coast for approximately

in and around El Paso, Texas from Southwest X-Ray, LP.

_Other Tuck-in Acquisitions– From October, 2019 through January 1, 2020, we acquired four diagnostic imaging_
centers in Florida in two separate tuck-in transactions and one diagnostic imaging center in Illinois in a tuckin transaction.

**Seasonality**

The seasonality in our business usually leads to lower first calendar quarter revenue and profitability from typically
weaker utilization of services. Our business is also affected by the hurricane season which may impact our
operations in coastal regions, particularly in Florida, albeit the Company seeks to mitigate disruptions as a result of
hurricane damage through insurance coverage. Our geographic diversification across the Northeast, Southeast and
Central United States helps to diminish such seasonality risks.

**Competition**

The market for diagnostic imaging services is highly competitive. We compete principally on the basis of our
reputation, our ability to provide multiple modalities at many of our centers, the location of our centers and the
quality of our diagnostic imaging services. In the markets in which we are operating, or anticipate operating, we
compete locally with groups of radiologists, established hospitals, clinics and other independent organizations that
own and operate imaging equipment.

**Compliance and Internal Controls**

The Company is subject to a range of state and federal regulatory laws and statutes. Compliance and related internal
controls are managed by the Company’s Chief Compliance Officer, who chairs the Company’s Compliance
Committee. The Compliance Committee has oversight with respect to the following matters:

    - audit compliance in marketing, operations, billing, clinical, information technology, exclusions checks,
human resources and quarterly compliance checks vis-à-vis the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and
Clinical Health Act of 2009, and regulations implemented thereunder (collectively, “HIPAA”). These


-----

audits encompass members of our leadership teams within these areas and provide information related
to compliance with specific statutes, including the False Claims Act, the Anti-Kickback Statute,
HIPAA, the Stark Law and the state equivalent of the Stark Law and other similar statutes. The
Compliance Committee analyzes this information to recommend and implement solutions;

    - risk analysis for each of above areas (completed quarterly). This analysis focuses on regulatory
compliance and is used for building the structure of audits for each area. Items identified are assigned
scores which include likelihood of occurrence, resulting impact of occurrence and trending data for
mitigating risk;

    - oversight to investigations and trends within compliance program (ongoing). The Chief Compliance
Officer guides his team regarding investigations and, where appropriate, completes these investigations
directly and reports findings to both the Compliance Committee and the Compliance Board;

    - review and modify policies and procedures, as needed (ongoing); and

    - review and modify company training (ongoing).

The Company’s compliance program also includes annual training for Compliance Committee members, a
compliance hotline and compliance management software.

The Company’s internal controls for mitigating regulatory risk include:

    - policies and procedures which address specific compliance issues, including marketing, operations,
and compliance with specific statutes such as the False Claims Act, the Anti-Kickback Statute,
HIPAA, the Stark Law and other similar statutes;

    - training and education of employees on prevention of fraud and abuse, including with respect to
HIPAA. One of the basic tools of this training is our Code of Conduct;

    - employee-specific training provided for different job titles within the Company to address risks
pertaining to their role;

    - training provided to employees through our compliance management software platform which
provides information including training reports for individual employees;

    - management of a company-wide compliance hotline. Employees are trained to use it any time they see
or suspect compliance issues. This hotline is available via phone, email, and fax and employees can
maintain complete anonymity without fear of retaliation;

    - having a Compliance Committee and a Compliance Board; and

    - having a Chief Compliance Officer and other compliance staff.

**Healthcare Laws**

**_The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute_**

Federal law known as the Anti-kickback Statute prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or
receipt of any form of remuneration in return for, or to induce, the referral of a person, the furnishing or arranging
for the furnishing of items or services reimbursable under the Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs
or the purchase, lease or order or arranging or recommending purchasing, leasing or ordering of any item or service
reimbursable under the Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs. The Anti-kickback Statute is broad,
and it prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry.
The Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has issued regulations as
"safe harbor" guidelines which if met in form and substance, will assure healthcare providers that they will not be
prosecuted for violation of the Anti–kickback Statute. Although full compliance with these provisions ensures


-----

against prosecution under the federal Anti-kickback Statute, the failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit within a
specific safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the transaction or arrangement is illegal or that prosecution under
the federal Anti-kickback Statute will be pursued.

**_Stark Law_**

The Stark Law prohibits a physician from referring Medicare patients to an entity providing designated health
services in which the physician (or immediate family member) has an ownership or investment interest or with
which the physician (or immediate family member) has entered into a compensation arrangement. The Stark Law
also prohibits the entity from billing for any such prohibited referral. Under the Stark Law, radiology and certain
other imaging services and radiation therapy services and supplies are services included in the designated health
services subject to the self-referral prohibition. Such services include the professional and technical components of
any diagnostic test or procedure using X-rays, ultrasound or other imaging services, CT, MRI, radiation therapy and
diagnostic mammography services (but not screening mammography services). PET and nuclear medicine
procedures are also included as designated health services under the Stark Law. The Stark Law, however, excludes
from designated health services: (i) X-ray, fluoroscopy or ultrasound procedures that require the insertion of a
needle, catheter, tube or probe through the skin or into a body orifice; (ii) radiology procedures that are integral to
the performance of, and performed during, non-radiological medical procedures; and (iii) invasive or interventional
radiology, because the radiology services in these procedures are merely incidental or secondary to another
procedure that the physician has ordered.

The Stark Law provides that a request by a radiologist for diagnostic radiology services or a request by a radiation
oncologist for radiation therapy, if such services are furnished by or under the supervision of such radiologist or
radiation oncologist pursuant to a consultation requested by another physician, does not constitute a referral by a
referring physician. If such requirements are met, the Stark Law self-referral prohibition would not apply to such
services. The effect of the Stark Law on the radiology practices, therefore, will depend on the precise scope of
services furnished by each such practice’s radiologists and whether such services derive from consultations or are
self-generated.

**_Federal False Claims Act_**

The Federal False Claims Act prohibits a person from knowingly presenting, or caused to be presented, a false or
fraudulent request for payment from the federal government, or from making a false statement or using a false
record to get a claim approved. The federal False Claims Act further provides that a lawsuit thereunder may be
initiated in the name of the United States by an individual, a “whistleblower,” who is an original source of the
allegations. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a
violation of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute or the Stark Law constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for
purposes of the civil False Claims Act.

**_State Law Equivalents_**

Many states have adopted laws similar anti-kickback and false claims laws. Some of these state prohibitions apply to
referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
Although we believe that we comply with both federal and state Anti-kickback laws, any finding of a violation of
these laws could subject us to criminal and civil penalties or possible exclusion from federal or state healthcare
programs. Such penalties would adversely affect our financial performance and our ability to operate our business.

**_Licensing and Certification Laws_**

Ownership, construction, operation, expansion and acquisition of diagnostic imaging facilities are subject to various
federal and state laws, regulations and approvals concerning licensing of facilities and personnel. In addition,
freestanding diagnostic imaging facilities that provide services not performed as part of a physician office must meet
Medicare requirements to be certified as an independent diagnostic testing facility before it can be authorized to bill
the Medicare program.


-----

**_Radiologist Licensing_**

The radiologists providing professional medical services at our facilities are subject to licensing and related
regulations by the states in which they provide services. As a result, we require the radiology groups with which we
contract to require those radiologists to have and maintain appropriate licensure. We do not believe that such laws
and regulations will either prohibit or require licensure approval of our business operations, although no assurances
can be made that such laws and regulations will not be interpreted to extend such prohibitions or requirements to our
operations.

**_Corporate Practice of Medicine and Professional Fee-Splitting_**

Certain states prohibit a lay person or any entity other than a professional corporation or other similar professional
organization from practicing medicine, including by employing professional persons or by having any ownership
interest or profit participation in or control over any medical professional practice. The laws of such states also
prohibit a lay person or a non-professional entity from exercising control over the medical judgments or decisions of
physicians and from engaging in certain financial arrangements, such as splitting professional fees with physicians.
We structure our relationships with the radiology practices, including the purchase of diagnostic imaging facilities,
in a manner that we believe keeps us from engaging in the practice of medicine, exercising control over the medical
judgments or decisions of the radiology practices or their physicians, or violating the prohibitions against feesplitting.

**Data Privacy & Security Laws**

Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, including consumer protection laws and regulations, govern the
collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality and security of personal information, including healthrelated information. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data
breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws and
regulations (e.g., Section 5 of the FTC Act), that govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of healthrelated and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners. For example,
HIPAA imposes privacy, security and breach notification obligations on certain health care providers, health plans,
and health care clearinghouses, known as covered entities, as well as their business associates that perform certain
services that involve creating, receiving, maintaining or transmitting individually identifiable health information for
or on behalf of such covered entities. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a breach of
unsecured protected health information, a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by HHS, may be subject to
significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations
if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA
non-compliance. Further, entities that knowingly obtain, use, or disclose individually identifiable health information
maintained by a HIPAA covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA may be subject to
criminal penalties.

Even when HIPAA does not apply, according to the FTC, violating consumers’ privacy rights or failing to take
appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure may constitute unfair acts or practices in or
affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The FTC expects a
company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of
consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve
security and reduce vulnerabilities. Individually identifiable health information is considered sensitive data that
merits stronger safeguards.

In addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some
of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not
have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can
result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. For example, California
recently enacted the CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA, among other things, creates new
data privacy obligations for covered companies and provides new privacy rights to California residents, including
the right to opt out of certain disclosures of their information. The CCPA also creates a private right of action with
statutory damages for certain data breaches, thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach.


-----

**Coverage and Reimbursement**

Our revenue is derived from a diverse mix of third-party payors, including private payors, managed care capitated
payors and government payors. We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from direct billings to governmental
healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and private health insurance companies and/or health plans,
including but not limited to those participating in the Medicare Advantage program. For services for which we bill
Medicare directly or indirectly, including through contracted radiologists, we are paid under the Medicare Physician
Fee Schedule. Medicaid rates are set by the individual states for each state program and Medicaid patients may be
responsible for a modest co-payment. Generally, commercial insurance companies reimburse us, directly or
indirectly, including through the contracted radiology groups elsewhere, on the basis of agreed upon rates. These
rates are negotiated and may differ materially with rates set forth in the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule for the
particular service. The patients may be responsible for certain co-payments or deductibles.

Government and private payors have taken and may continue to take steps to control the cost, eligibility for, use, and
delivery of healthcare services as a result of budgetary constraints, cost containment pressures and other reasons. For
example, reimbursement by government payors for a number of diagnostic imaging procedures has been materially
reduced over the last number of years. Certain private payors have followed suit and reduced reimbursement for
certain diagnostic imaging procedures. Further, CMS and other payors are seeking to shift from a primarily fee for
service reimbursement paradigm to a more value based model.

**Employees**

As at December 31, 2019, we had approximately 1,737 employees.

We employ site managers who are responsible for overseeing day-to-day and routine operations at each of our
outpatient diagnostic imaging centers, including staffing, modality and schedule coordination, referring physician
and patient relations and ordering of materials. These site managers report to regional directors, who are responsible
for oversight of the operations of all outpatient diagnostic imaging centers within their region, including operations,
marketing and contracting. The regional directors, along with our directors of contracting, marketing, facilities,
management/purchasing and human resources all report to our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating
Officer. Our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, and our Chief Financial Officer and Corporate
Secretary report directly to our President and Chief Executive Officer.

None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we have had no labor-related work
stoppages.

**Environmental and Corporate Responsibility**

Management seeks to keep individual and collective exposure to doses of radioactive materials and radiation sources
“as low as reasonably achievable” (or “ALARA”). The ALARA approach focuses on actively seeking out methods
to minimize radiation exposure.

In addition to having established written policies, procedures and instructions to foster the ALARA concept within
the Company, we have a dedicated Radiation Safety Officer (“RSO”). The RSO performs quarterly and annual
reviews and implements changes driven by regulatory or industry requirements.

Modifications to procedures, equipment and facilities that could reduce radiation exposure are considered and
reviewed by the RSO with management annually. In addition to maintaining doses to individuals ALARA, the sum
of the doses received by all exposed individuals are also maintained ALARA. The RSO reviews the results of
personnel monitoring every quarter and addresses any increased levels.

Radioactive material licenses issued to Akumin are maintained by the RSO and reviewed by a contracted licensed
medical physicist every quarter. The radioactive materials held by the Company for equipment calibration and
patient use are of low level. None of our facilities release radioactive material into the environment. All radioactive
waste is held for storage in-house and decayed to background level prior to disposal.


-----

Our board of directors (“Board”) has also adopted a written code of conduct (the “Code of Conduct”) that applies to
all of our directors, officers and employees. The objective of the Code of Conduct is to provide guidelines for
maintaining our and our subsidiaries’ integrity, reputation, honesty, objectivity and impartiality. The Code of
Conduct addresses conflicts of interest, protection of our assets, confidentiality, fair dealing with shareholders,
competitors and employees, insider trading, compliance with laws and reporting any illegal or unethical behavior.
As part of the Code of Conduct, any person subject to the Code of Conduct is required to avoid or fully disclose
interests or relationships that are harmful or detrimental to our best interests or that may give rise to real, potential or
the appearance of conflicts of interest. Our Board has ultimate responsibility for the stewardship of the Code of
Conduct and monitors compliance through our Governance Committee. Directors, officers and employees are
required to annually certify that they have not violated the Code of Conduct.

**Litigation**

We are, from time to time, involved in legal proceedings, regulatory actions and investigations of a nature
considered normal to our business. Health care companies are subject to numerous investigations by various
government agencies. In addition, private parties have the right to bring “qui tam”, or “whistleblower” suits against
companies under the FCA. On or about August 27, 2019, Akumin Inc. was served with a Civil Investigative
Demand from the United States Department of Justice, United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Delaware
investigating whether our operations in Delaware and Texas complied with the supervision requirements for MRI
procedures and other diagnostic imaging tests. We believe that none of the litigation and investigations in which we
are currently involved, or have been involved since the beginning of the most recently completed financial year,
individually or in the aggregate, is material to our consolidated financial condition or results of operations, nor are
any such proceedings known by us to be contemplated. See further discussion under “Risk Factors” above.

**Corporate Integrity Agreements**

Prior to our acquisition of Akumin Texas, PIC, then a wholly-owned subsidiary of Akumin Texas which was
merged into Akumin Texas effective September 30, 2017, was the subject of an investigation by the DOJ premised
upon an allegation that PIC and its affiliates violated U.S. federal law by performing and billing for certain imaging
services without on-site physician supervision. In or about June, 2016, PIC entered into a no-fault settlement
agreement with the DOJ with respect to those allegations, which included PIC paying $3.5 million to the U.S.
government and entering into a CIA with the Office of the Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services. PIC’s CIA expires June 29, 2021. Also, prior to our acquisition of the imaging centers operated by
Rose Radiology, Rose Radiology (through its predecessor, Rose Radiology Centers, Inc.) was the subject of an
investigation by the DOJ premised upon allegations that Rose Radiology violated the False Claims Act for billing
Medicare for ineligible procedures and certain other healthcare laws. Upon our acquisition of Rose Radiology’s
assets, Rose Radiology, a physician-owned radiology practice, retained Akumin as its manager for administrative
and other non-clinical matters. In or about December, 2015, Rose Radiology entered into a no-fault settlement
agreement with the DOJ with respect to those allegations which included Rose Radiology paying $8.7 million to the
U.S. government and entering into a CIA. Rose Radiology’s CIA expires December 29, 2020.

The compliance measures and the reporting and auditing requirements contained in the CIAs include:

    - continuing the duties and activities of the Compliance Officer and Compliance Committee;

    - maintaining written policies and procedures addressing matters included in our Compliance Program;

    - continuing general compliance training;

    - engaging an independent third party to perform an annual review of our compliance with the CIAs,
including a claims review for PIC and Rose Radiology and an arrangements review for Rose
Radiology;

    - continuing the confidential disclosure program and hotline to enable employees or others to disclose
issues or questions regarding possible inappropriate policies or behavior;


-----

    - continuing the screening program to ensure that we do not hire or engage employees or contractors
who are ineligible persons for federal healthcare programs;

    - reporting any material deficiency which resulted in an overpayment to us by a federal healthcare
program; and submitting annual reports to the OIG which describe in detail the operations of the
corporate Compliance Program.

Material, uncorrected violations of the CIA could lead to our exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid
and other federal and state healthcare programs. In addition, we are subject to possible civil penalties for failure to
substantially comply with the terms of the CIA, including stipulated penalties ranging between $1,000 and $2,500
per day. We are also subject to a stipulated penalty of $50,000 for each false certification made by us or on our
behalf, pursuant to the reporting provisions of the CIA. The CIA increases the amount of information we must
provide to the federal government regarding our practices at our healthcare facilities and our compliance with
federal regulations. The reports we provide in connection with the CIA could result in greater scrutiny by other
regulatory agencies.

Given the broad powers of the DOJ and other federal agencies, there can be no assurance that the obligations of
Akumin Texas and Rose Radiology pursuant to their respective CIAs, or otherwise, will not be expanded to cover
all or a greater portion of Akumin’s operations. Any action brought against us for violation of these laws or
regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, suffer
reputational harm and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business.

**CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

In the normal course of business, the Company engages in transactions with its wholly owned and controlled
subsidiaries. Balances and transactions between the Company and its wholly owned and controlled subsidiaries have
been eliminated on consolidation in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

The Company transacts with key individuals from management who have the authority to plan, direct, and control
the activities of the Company, including through employment agreements and stock-based compensation plans. Key
management personnel are defined as the executive officers of the Company and the board of directors, including
the President and Chief Executive Officer, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial
Officer and Corporate Secretary and Senior Vice Presidents.

There are no material interests, direct or indirect, of any of our directors or executive officers, any shareholder that
beneficially owns or controls or directs (directly or indirectly) more than 10% of any class or series of our
outstanding voting securities, or any associate or affiliate of any of the foregoing persons, in any transaction within
the three most recently completed financial years or during the current financial year that has materially affected or
is reasonably expected to materially affect us or any of our subsidiaries.

On February 8, 2018, Akumin Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Akumin Inc., entered into a contract with the
President and Chief Executive Officer, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial
Officer and Corporate Secretary (collectively, the “Pledgors”) to loan an aggregate of $500,000 in connection with
the purchase by such Pledgors of a total of 142,857 common shares of the Company from certain selling security
holders of PMI Partners, LLC, pursuant to the terms of a put and call option agreement made as of August 9, 2017
between Z Strategies Inc., a company controlled by the President and Chief Executive Officer, and certain selling
security holders of PMI. This loan charged interest at 6% per annum and was payable on maturity at February 8,
2021. During 2019, the Pledgors completely paid off this loan and accrued interest.


-----

**DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN OTHER INDEBTEDNESS**

_The following description is a summary of the material provisions of our material indebtedness, excluding the notes_
_offered hereby, as they exist on the date hereof and expected to be outstanding after the closing of this offering and_
_the application of the proceeds therefrom._

**_The Existing Credit Agreement_**

Our wholly owned subsidiary, Akumin Corp., is the borrower under a credit agreement dated as of August 15, 2018
(as amended on March 31, 2019 and June 2, 2020, the “Existing Credit Agreement”), which provides for a senior
secured term loan A in an aggregate principal amount of $66 million (the “Term Loan A”), a senior secured term
loan B in an aggregate principal amount of $266 million (the “Term Loan B” and, together with the Term Loan A,
the “Existing Term Loans”) and a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $69
million (the “Existing Revolving Credit Facility” and, together with the Existing Term Loans, the “Existing Loans”).
The Existing Term Loans and the Existing Revolving Credit Facility are expected to be terminated and repaid with
the proceeds of the notes offered hereunder and will not remain outstanding following the closing of this transaction
and the issuance of the notes. See “Use of Proceeds”.

**_The New Revolving Credit Agreement_**

Concurrently with the offering of the notes, the Company expects to enter into a new revolving credit agreement (the
“New Revolving Credit Agreement”) with BBVA USA, as administrative and collateral agent (the “Agent”), which
is expected to provide for a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $75 million
(the “New Revolving Credit Facility”), with sublimits for the issuance of letters of credit and for swingline loans.
Although we are seeking revolving credit commitments of up to $75 million from financial institutions, no assurance
can be made that we will be able to secure revolving commitments in this amount and the actual amount of
revolving credit commitments under our New Revolving Credit Facility may be significantly less than $75 million.
The Revolving Credit Facility is expected to mature on the date that is five years after the issue date (the “Revolving
Credit Facility Maturity Date”); provided that, if more than $50 million in aggregate principal amount of notes is
outstanding on the date that is 181 days prior to the Revolving Credit Facility Maturity Date, then the Revolving
Credit Facility Maturity Date shall instead be the date that is 181 days prior to the Revolving Credit Facility
Maturity Date.

The availability of borrowings under the New Revolving Credit Facility will be subject to customary terms and
conditions.

The New Revolving Credit Facility is expected to have negative covenants and events of default substantially
similar to the negative covenants and events of default in the indenture governing the notes. In addition, it is
expected that the New Revolving Credit Facility will contain a “springing” financial maintenance covenant based on
a first lien net leverage ratio. The financial covenant will be tested on the last day of any fiscal quarter if the
aggregate principal amount of loans outstanding under the New Revolving Credit Facility exceed a certain
percentage of the total amount of commitments under the New Revolving Credit Facility on such day.

The New Revolving Credit Facility will be required to be guaranteed by the Company’s wholly-owned restricted
subsidiaries, including our Professional Services Affiliates, that are organized under the laws of the United States or
any political subdivision thereof, in each case subject to certain exceptions. The New Revolving Credit Facility will
be secured by (i) a first-priority lien on substantially all of the tangible and intangible personal property of the
Company and the guarantors and (ii) a pledge of substantially all of the shares of stock, partnership interests and
limited liability company interests of each restricted subsidiary that are directly held by the Company or a guarantor.

The interest rates per annum applicable to loans under the New Revolving Credit Facility will be equal to, at the
Company’s option, either a LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin or a base rate plus an applicable margin. The
Company will be required to pay a commitment fee on the undrawn portion available under the New Revolving
Credit Facility.


-----

The information set forth above regarding our New Revolving Credit Facility is a summary and is subject to change.
It does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the documents governing the New
Revolving Credit Facility, including the definition of certain terms therein.

The New Revolving Credit Facility is being negotiated among the Company and the lenders thereunder and as such
the terms set forth above (including the aggregate principal amount of revolving commitments) may be changed.
Furthermore, the terms of the New Revolving Credit Facility are subject to market conditions and there can be no
assurance that the New Revolving Credit Facility will be effective on the issue date or at all.

**_Wesley Chapel Loan_**

Our subsidiary, Rose Radiology Centers, Inc., is the borrower of a purchase money secured loan (the “Wesley
Chapel Loan”) with a face value of $2 million as of August 15, 2018, which was issued to finance the purchase of
equipment and related installation for a new clinic location around Tampa Bay, Florida. It has an annual interest rate
of 5%, matures on August 15, 2023, has monthly repayments of approximately $38 thousand and is secured only by
liens on the equipment financed. As of June 30, 2020, the face value of the Wesley Chapel Loan was approximately
$1.3 million.

**_Subordinated Note_**

In connection with an acquisition, our subsidiary, Akumin FL, LLC, assumed a subordinated note from the sellers
on May 11, 2018 with a principal amount of $1.5 million due to a lender. The obligations under that subordinated
note are secured by liens on all of the assets of Akumin FL, LLC and are subordinated to a working capital loan with
a principal amount of up to $5 million owed by Akumin FL, LLC to Akumin Corp. The principal amount of $1.5
million under the subordinated note was prepaid in full in connection with the financing in 2019. However, subject
to certain contingencies related to the performance of the acquisition target during the period from January 1, 2019
through December 31, 2021, the principal amount due under the subordinated note may be increased from $0 (zero)
to a maximum of $4 million. As of June 30, 2020, this liability is estimated at approximately $0.2 million.


-----

**DESCRIPTION OF NOTES**

We will issue the notes (as used in this Description of Notes section only, the “Notes”) under an indenture to be
entered into between Akumin Inc. (the “Issuer”), the Guarantors (as defined below) and UMB Bank, National
Association, as trustee (in such capacity, the “Trustee”) and as notes collateral agent (in such capacity, the
“Collateral Agent”). The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the indenture, the
Collateral Documents (as defined below) and the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below). It does not
restate the indenture, the Collateral Documents or the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement in their entirety and is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the indenture, the Collateral Documents and the First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement, including the definitions contained in the foregoing of certain terms used below. We urge you to read
the indenture, the Notes, the Collateral Documents and the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement because they, and not
this description, will define your rights as a holder of the Notes. Copies of the proposed forms of the indenture, the
Notes, the Collateral Documents and the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement are available to you upon request.

You can find the definitions of some of the capitalized terms used in this section under the subheading “—Certain
definitions.” In this section of the offering memorandum:

- the terms “Issuer,” “we,” “us,” “our” or similar terms refer only to Akumin Inc. and not to any of our
subsidiaries; and

- references to “Guarantors” shall mean our direct and indirect Restricted Subsidiaries (including our Professional
Services Affiliates) that guarantee the Notes.

The terms of the Notes include only those terms specifically stated in the indenture and the Notes. The indenture
will not be qualified under or subject to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

**Holding Company Structure**

The Issuer is a holding company and does not have any material assets or operations other than ownership of the
Capital Stock of its subsidiaries and its relationships with its Professional Services Affiliates. All of its material
operations are conducted through its Subsidiaries. As a result, the Issuer depends on the cash flow of its Subsidiaries
to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Notes. Claims of creditors of such Subsidiaries that are
not Guarantors, including trade creditors, and claims of preferred stockholders, if any, of such Subsidiaries generally
will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of such Subsidiaries over the claims of the Issuer’s
creditors, including holders of the Notes. The Notes, therefore, are structurally subordinated to creditors, including
trade creditors, and preferred stockholders, if any, of our Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors.

**Brief Description of the Notes and the Guarantees**

**_The Notes_**

The Notes will:

- be senior secured obligations of the Issuer;

- rank equally in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s existing and future senior debt (including the Credit
Agreement Obligations);

- rank senior in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s future Subordinated Indebtedness, if any;

- be secured on a first-priority basis by Liens on the Collateral (subject to Permitted Liens and certain exceptions)
on an equal and ratable basis with all existing and future First Lien Obligations of the Issuer (including the Credit
Agreement Obligations);

- rank effectively senior to all existing and future unsecured debt and any future Junior Lien Obligations of the
Issuer, to the extent of the value of the Collateral;

- rank effectively junior to all existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is secured by Liens on assets that
do not constitute a part of the Collateral, to the extent of the value of such assets;

- be structurally subordinated to all debt and other liabilities (including trade payables) of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries
that are not Guarantors; and

- be fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Guarantors.


-----

The Notes will be issued in fully registered form only, without coupons, in minimum denominations of $2,000 and
integral multiples of $1,000.

**_The Guarantees_**

As of the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed by the Guarantors, which will include substantially all of our
direct and indirect Wholly-Owned Restricted Subsidiaries (including our Professional Services Affiliates), in each
case, that are organized under the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof. In addition,
following the Issue Date, any Restricted Subsidiary (including our Professional Services Affiliates) of the Issuer that
becomes a guarantor under certain Indebtedness must also guarantee the Notes.

Not all of our Subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of
any of these non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, these non-Guarantor Subsidiaries will be obligated to pay the holders of
their indebtedness and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to us. For the six
months ended June 30, 2020 and year ended December 31, 2019 our non-Guarantor Subsidiaries represented
approximately 6% and 6%, respectively, of our total revenue. As of June 30, 2020, our non-Guarantor Subsidiaries
held approximately 3% of our total assets and approximately 0.5% of our total liabilities. As of June 30, 2020, on an
as adjusted basis after giving effect to this offering, our non-Guarantor Subsidiaries held approximately 3% of our
total assets and approximately 0.5% of our total liabilities, to which the Notes would have been structurally
subordinated.

The Guarantee provided by each Guarantor will:

- be a senior secured obligation of such Guarantor;

- rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future senior debt of such Guarantor (including the Credit
Agreement Obligations);

- rank senior in right of payment to all future Subordinated Indebtedness of such Guarantor, if any;

- be secured on a first-priority basis by Liens on the Collateral (subject to Permitted Liens and certain exceptions)
on an equal and ratable basis with all existing and future obligations of such Guarantor under any other First Lien
Obligations (including the Credit Agreement Obligations);

- rank effectively senior to all existing and future unsecured obligations and obligations of such Guarantor under
any Junior Lien Obligations, to the extent of the value of the Collateral;

- rank effectively junior to all existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is secured by Liens on assets
that do not constitute a part of the Collateral, to the extent of the value of such assets; and

- be structurally subordinated to all debt and other liabilities (including trade payables) of any Subsidiaries (if any)
of such Guarantor that are not Guarantors.

Under certain circumstances, we will be permitted to designate certain of our Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted
Subsidiaries.” Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the restrictive covenants in the indenture. Unrestricted
Subsidiaries will not guarantee the Notes.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Notes will be issued in an aggregate principal amount of $375 million. Additional Notes (“Additional Notes”)
may be issued under the indenture from time to time in an unlimited amount, subject to compliance with the
covenants contained in the indenture. Any additional Notes will be part of the same series as the Notes offered
hereby and will vote on all matters as a single series with the Notes offered in this offering; provided, however, that
no additional notes will be issued with the same CUSIP or ISIN as the existing Notes unless the Issuer intends to
treat such additional notes and the existing Notes as fungible for U.S. and Canadian federal income tax purposes. All
references to the Notes include additional Notes.

The Notes will mature on        , 2025.

Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate per annum set forth on the cover page of this offering memorandum, and
will be payable semiannually in cash on each         and        , commencing        , 2021, to holders of
record on the immediately preceding         and        , respectively. Interest on the Notes will accrue from


-----

the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from the date of issuance.
Interest on the Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year composed of twelve 30-day months.

Solely for the purposes of disclosure pursuant to the Interest Act (Canada)., whenever any interest is calculated using
a rate based on a year of 360 days or the number of days in accordance with market practice, as the case may be,
such rate determined pursuant to such calculation, when expressed as an annual rate, is equivalent to (i) the
applicable rate based on a year of 360 days or the number of days in accordance with market practice, as the case
may be, multiplied by (ii) the actual number of days in the calendar year in which the period for such interest is
payable (or compounded) ends, divided by (iii) 360 or the number of days in accordance with market practice, as the
case may be. The principle of deemed reinvestment of interest shall not apply to any interest calculation under the
Indenture; all interest payments to be made under the Indenture shall be paid without allowance or deduction for
deemed reinvestment or otherwise, before and after demand, default and judgment. The rates of interest specified in
the Indenture are intended to be nominal rates and not effective rates, and any interest calculated thereunder shall be
calculated using the nominal rate method and not the effective rate method of calculation.

The Notes will be payable both as to principal and interest at our office or agency maintained for such purpose or, at
our option, payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the holders of the Notes at their respective
addresses set forth in the register of holders of Notes. Until otherwise designated by us, our office or agency
maintained for such purpose will be the office of the Trustee.

**Guarantees**

Each Guarantor will, jointly and severally with each other Guarantor, guarantee the Issuer’s obligations under the
Notes. The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent such Guarantee
from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under applicable law. This provision may not,
however, be effective to protect a Guarantee from being voided under fraudulent transfer or conveyance law, or may
reduce the applicable Guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its Guarantee worthless. In
addition to potentially being voidable, a Guarantee could also be subordinated by a court to all other Indebtedness
(including Guarantees and other contingent liabilities) of the Guarantor, and, depending on the amount of such
Indebtedness, a Guarantor’s liability on its Guarantee could be reduced to zero. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to
the Notes—A subsidiary guarantee could be voided if it constitutes a fraudulent transfer under U.S. bankruptcy or
similar state law or foreign law, which would prevent the holders of the notes from relying on that subsidiary to
satisfy claims.”

Each Guarantor that makes a payment or distribution under a Guarantee will be entitled upon payment in full of all
guaranteed obligations under the Indenture to a contribution from each other Guarantor in an amount equal to such
other Guarantor’s pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net worth of all the Guarantors at the
time of such payment determined in accordance with IFRS.

Each Guarantor may consolidate or amalgamate with or merge into or sell its assets to us or another Restricted
Subsidiary, or with or to other Persons in a transaction that complies with the covenants described under “—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales” or “—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets,” as
applicable.

The Guarantee of a Guarantor will be deemed automatically discharged and released upon:

(1) in connection with any direct or indirect sale, conveyance or other disposition of all the capital stock of such
Guarantor (including any such sale, conveyance or other disposition after which such Guarantor is no longer a
Restricted Subsidiary and excluding any sale, conveyance or other disposition of the Capital Stock of a
Professional Services Affiliate to another Person if such Professional Services Affiliate remains a Restricted
Subsidiary) or of all or substantially all of the assets and property of such Guarantor, if such sale or disposition
is made in compliance with the applicable provisions of the indenture (see “—Certain Covenants—Limitation
on Asset Sales”);

(2) if such Guarantor is liquidated in accordance with the provisions of the indenture;

(3) if we designate any such Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in compliance with the terms of the
indenture;

(4) with respect to any Guarantor that initially provided its guarantee of the Notes pursuant to the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Subsidiary Guarantees” (which, for the avoidance of


-----

doubt, does not include any Guarantor as of the Issue Date), upon the release or discharge (other than a release
or discharge by or as a result of payment under such guarantee or payment in full of such Indebtedness) of the
guarantee by such Guarantor of the Indebtedness that resulted in the requirement for such Guarantor to
provide its guarantee of the Notes;

(5) upon a discharge of the indenture in accordance with “—Satisfaction and Discharge” or upon any Legal
Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance of the indenture.

For the avoidance of doubt, no Guarantee of a Guarantor shall be released as a result of the issuance or sale of
Preferred Equity Interests in a Restricted Subsidiary to a Strategic Partner.

**Security**

**_General_**

The Notes and the Guarantees will be secured by first priority Liens on the Collateral, in each case subject to certain
exceptions, Permitted Liens and encumbrances described in the indenture and the Collateral Documents. The Notes
and the Guarantees will share in the benefit of such Liens on the Collateral on a pari passu basis with the other First
Lien Obligations, including the Credit Agreement Obligations.

The Liens on the Collateral that will secure the Notes and the Guarantees will be granted under the Collateral
Documents in favor of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Notes Secured Parties. By its acceptance of a Note,
each holder of the Notes authorizes the Collateral Agent and the Trustee, if applicable, to execute, deliver and
perform its obligations under the Collateral Documents, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and, if applicable,
any Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement, binding the holders to the terms thereof.

The Collateral will consist of all of the property and assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors that also secure the
Credit Agreement Obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors pursuant to the Credit Agreement Documents (and,
for the avoidance of doubt, subject to equivalent limitations and qualifications applying to the security securing the
Credit Agreement Obligations). In addition, the indenture and the Collateral Documents will exclude certain
property from the Collateral (the “Excluded Property”), including:

(1) vehicles or other assets covered by a certificate of title or ownership,

(2) any interest in real property (whether fee or leasehold or otherwise),

(3) commercial tort claims with a value of less than $5.0 million (with such value determined by the Issuer in
good faith),

(4) those assets as to which the Issuer and the Credit Agreement Administrative Agent shall reasonably determine
in writing that the costs of obtaining such security interest are excessive in relation to the value of the security
to be afforded thereby; provided that the Collateral Agent shall have received written notice of such
determination and if such assets have a fair market value (as determined by the Issuer) in excess of $7.5
million, such assets do not secure (or purport to secure) any other First Lien Obligations or any Junior Lien
Obligations,

(5) assets if the granting or perfecting of a security interest in such assets in favor of the Collateral Agent would
violate any applicable law (other than to the extent that any such term would be rendered ineffective pursuant
to Section 9-406, 9-407, 9-408 or 9-409 of the Uniform Commercial Code of any applicable jurisdiction or
other similar applicable law in any jurisdiction) or principles of equity,

(6) any right, title or interest in any instrument, permit, lease, intangible, general intangible (other than Equity
Interests), license, contract or agreement to the extent, but only to the extent that a grant of a security interest
therein to secure the Notes Obligations would, under the terms of such instrument, permit, lease, intangible,
general intangible (other than Equity Interests), license, contract or agreement, result in a breach of the terms
of, or constitute a default under, or result in the abandonment, termination, invalidation or unenforceability of,
or require the consent of any person other than the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries, which has not been
obtained under such instrument, permit, lease, intangible, general intangible, license, contract or agreement
(other than to the extent that any such term would be rendered ineffective pursuant to Section 9-406, 9-407, 9408 or 9-409 of the Uniform Commercial Code of any applicable jurisdiction or any other applicable law
(including, without limitation, Title 11 of the United States Code and the PPSA) or other similar applicable
law in any jurisdiction or principles of equity),


-----

(7) any Capital Stock acquired after the Issue Date (other than Capital Stock in a Subsidiary (including
Professional Services Affiliates) issued or acquired after such Person became a Subsidiary) in accordance with
the indenture if, and to the extent that, and for so long as, in the case of this clause (7), (i) such Capital Stock
constitutes less than 50% of all applicable Capital Stock of such Person, and the Person or Persons holding the
remainder of such Capital Stock are not Affiliates of the Issuer to the extent and for so long as a grant of a
security interest therein to secure the Notes Obligations would be prohibited by the organizational documents
of such Person, (ii) the granting or perfecting of a security interest in such assets in favor of the Collateral
Agent would violate applicable law or a contractual obligation binding on such Capital Stock and (iii) with
respect to such contractual obligations (other than contractual obligations in connection with limited liability
company agreements, stockholders’ agreements and other joint venture agreements), such obligation existed at
the time of the acquisition of such Capital Stock and was not created or made binding on such Capital Stock in
contemplation of or in connection with the acquisition of such Person,

(8) any Property purchased with the proceeds of Purchase Money Indebtedness incurred pursuant to clause (6)
under the heading “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness” if the contract or other
agreement in which the Indebtedness and/or Liens related thereto is granted (or the documentation providing
for such Capital Lease Obligation) prohibits or requires the consent of any Person other than the Issuer or any
of its Subsidiaries as a condition to the creation of any other security interest on such Property,

(9) any Capital Stock of Unrestricted Subsidiaries,

(10) any assets of any Subsidiary that is not a U.S. Subsidiary or a Canadian Subsidiary or any property that is
located outside of the United States or Canada,

(11) certain accounts that are excluded pursuant to the Credit Agreement,

(12) any intent-to use Trademark applications prior to the filing of a “Statement of Use”, “Amendment to Allege
Use” or similar filing with regard thereto, to the extent and solely during the period, in which the grant of a
security interest therein may impair the validity or enforceability of any Trademark that may issue from such
intent to use Trademark application under applicable law, and

(13) “margin stock” (within the meaning of Regulation U issued by the FRB);

provided, however, that Excluded Property shall not include (x) any Capital Stock of any Professional Services
Affiliate and any agreements described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the definition of “PC Entity Requirements” or (y)
any proceeds, substitutions or replacements of any Excluded Property referred to in clauses (1) through (13) (unless
such proceeds, substitutions or replacements would constitute Excluded Property referred to in clauses (1) through
(13)).

In addition, control agreements shall not be required with respect to deposit accounts, securities accounts, or
uncertificated securities.

**_Certain Limitations on the Collateral_**

No appraisals of any of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor in
connection with the issuance and sale of the Notes. The value of the Collateral in the event of liquidation will
depend on many factors, including, among other things, the condition of the Collateral, the ability to sell the
Collateral in an orderly sale, the condition of the international, national and local economies, the availability of
buyers and similar factors. By its nature, some of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily
ascertainable market value or market. Consequently, liquidating the Collateral may not produce proceeds in an
amount sufficient to pay any amounts due on the Notes. We are also permitted to sell assets that constitute Collateral
and may not be required to offer to purchase the Notes.

In addition, the Collateral securing the Notes Obligations is shared with other creditors, subject to all other Permitted
Liens and the security interests in the Collateral securing the Notes will be pari passu in priority with any and all
security interests at any time granted to secure the Credit Agreement Obligations and other First Lien Obligations. If
there is a default, the value of the Collateral may not be sufficient to repay the creditors of First Lien Obligations,
including the holders of the Notes. In the event of a foreclosure, enforcement, Insolvency Proceeding, or similar
proceeding, we cannot assure you that the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the Collateral will be sufficient to
pay Notes Obligations and the other First Lien Obligations. Any claim for the difference between the amount, if any,
realized by holders of the Notes from the sale of Collateral securing the Notes Obligations will rank equally in right


-----

of payment with all of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other unsecured or undersecured senior Indebtedness and
other unsubordinated Obligations, including trade payables. To the extent that third parties establish Liens on the
Collateral, such third parties could have rights and remedies with respect to the assets that, if exercised, could
adversely affect the value of the Collateral or the ability of the Collateral Agent or the holders of the Notes to realize
or foreclose on the Collateral. The Issuer may also issue additional Notes after the Issue Date as described herein or
otherwise incur First Lien Obligations that would be secured by Liens on the Collateral, the effect of which would
be to increase the amount of Indebtedness secured equally and ratably by Liens on the Collateral. As described
below, the ability of the holders of the Notes to realize on the Collateral would also be subject to certain Bankruptcy
Law limitations in the event of an Insolvency Proceeding. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—Rights
of holders of the notes in the Collateral may be adversely affected by bankruptcy proceedings.”

**_Certain Bankruptcy and Insolvency Limitations_**

The right of the Collateral Agent to foreclose upon, enforce against, repossess, and dispose of the Collateral upon
the occurrence of an Event of Default would be significantly impaired (and at a minimum delayed) by applicable
Bankruptcy Law in the event that an Insolvency Proceeding were to be commenced by or against the Issuer or any
Guarantor prior to the Collateral Agent’s having foreclosed upon, repossessed, disposed of or otherwise enforced
against the Collateral. Upon the commencement of an Insolvency Proceeding, a secured creditor such as the
Collateral Agent is prohibited from foreclosing upon, enforcing or repossessing its security from a debtor, or from
disposing of previously repossessed security, in each case, without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not
be given under the facts in any particular circumstances).

In view of the broad equitable powers of a U.S. or Canadian bankruptcy court as well as the lack of a precise
definition of the term “adequate protection”, it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under the Notes
could be made following the commencement of an Insolvency Proceeding or the length of the delay in making any
such payments, whether or when the Collateral Agent could repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value of the
Collateral at any time during an Insolvency Proceeding or whether or to what extent holders of the Notes would be
compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral (through adequate protection or otherwise).

Furthermore, in the event a bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral is not sufficient to repay all
amounts due on the Notes and all other obligations secured on a pari passu or senior basis with respect to all or any
such Collateral, the holders of the Notes would hold secured claims only to the extent of the value of the Collateral
to which the holders of the Notes are entitled, and unsecured claims with respect to such shortfall. The Applicable
Bankruptcy Law permits the payment and/or accrual of post-petition interest, fees and expenses to a secured creditor
during a debtor’s Insolvency Proceeding only to the extent the value of such creditor’s interest in the collateral is
determined by the bankruptcy court to exceed the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the obligations secured
by the collateral. See “Risk Factors—Risk Related to the Notes—The value of the Collateral may not be sufficient to
secure postpetition interest, fees, and expenses in an Insolvency Proceeding of us or any of the guarantors. In the
event of an Insolvency Proceeding of us or any of the guarantors, the holders of the notes would be deemed to have
an unsecured claim to the extent that our obligations in respect of the notes and all of our other obligations secured
by the Collateral equal or exceed the fair market value of the Collateral.”

**_Release of Liens_**

The Collateral Documents and the indenture will provide that the Liens on the Collateral owned by any Guarantor
will be automatically released when such Guarantor’s Guarantee is released in accordance with the terms of the
indenture. In addition, the Liens securing the Notes and the Guarantees will be released automatically:

(1) in whole, upon payment in full of all principal, interest and other Obligations on the Notes issued under the
Indenture or satisfaction and discharge or defeasance thereof, as provided under the heading “—Legal
Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

(2) in whole or in part, with the consent of the requisite holders of Notes in accordance with the provisions under
the heading “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver”;

(3) in part, as to any Property constituting Collateral that is disposed of to a Person other than the Issuer or a
Guarantor (other than dispositions of the equity interests of Professional Services Affiliates or of property or
assets of Professional Services Affiliates to other Professional Services Affiliates or owners of the equity
interest of Professional Services Affiliates) in a transaction permitted pursuant to the provisions under the


-----

heading “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales” and not prohibited by the indenture, the Collateral
Documents or the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement;

(4) with respect to any Collateral that becomes “Excluded Property”, upon such Collateral becoming Excluded
Property pursuant to a transaction or circumstance not prohibited by the terms of the indenture;

(5) with respect to Collateral that is Capital Stock, upon the dissolution or liquidation of the issuer of such Capital
Stock in a transaction that is not prohibited by the terms of the indenture; and

(6) as described below in accordance with the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement;

The Collateral Agent will, without recourse, representation or warranty, execute documents reasonably requested by
the Issuer or the Guarantors to evidence the release of the Collateral as set forth above in accordance with the
provisions of the indenture, at the expense of the Issuer and the Guarantors, upon receipt of an officers’ certificate of
the Issuer certifying that such release of Collateral is in accordance with the terms of the indenture and that all
conditions precedent relating to the release of Collateral have been satisfied.

For the avoidance of doubt, no Liens on Collateral shall be released as a result of the issuance or sale of Preferred
Equity Interests in a Restricted Subsidiary to a Strategic Partner.

**_After-Acquired Collateral_**

From and after the Issue Date, if the Issuer or any Guarantor creates any additional security interest upon any
Property that would constitute Collateral to secure any First Lien Obligations, the Issuer and each of the Guarantors
must grant a first-priority perfected security interest (subject to Permitted Liens) upon any such Collateral, as
security for the Notes Obligations. The foregoing will be subject to certain exceptions consistent with the exceptions
set out in the Collateral Documents as in effect on the Issue Date. These exceptions will provide, among other
things, certain grace periods for perfection of Collateral and that certain Liens need not be created or perfected
where the costs outweigh the benefits of such grant.

**_Further Assurances_**

The Collateral Documents and the indenture will provide that the Issuer and the Guarantors shall, at their expense,
duly execute and deliver, or cause to be duly executed and delivered, such further agreements, documents,
instruments, financing and continuation statements (or equivalent statements) and amendments thereto and do or
cause to be done such further acts as may be necessary or proper or reasonably requested by the Collateral Agent to
evidence, perfect, maintain and enforce the security interests and the priority thereof in the Collateral in favor of the
Collateral Agent for its benefit and for the benefit of the holders of the Notes and the Trustee, and to otherwise
effectuate the provisions or purposes of the indenture and the Collateral Documents.

**_First Lien Intercreditor Agreement_**

The Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee, the Collateral Agent, the Credit Agreement Administrative Agent and the
Credit Agreement Collateral Agent will enter into an Intercreditor Agreement (as may be amended from time to
time, the “First Lien Intercreditor Agreement”), with respect to the Collateral, which may be amended, restated,
amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time without the consent of the holders of
the Notes to add other parties holding First Lien Obligations permitted to be incurred under the indenture and the
Credit Agreement (subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement). The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement will provide, among other things, (1) that Liens on the
Collateral securing the Notes Obligations, the Credit Agreement Obligations and any other First Lien Obligations
will be pari passu and that, except as provided below, all distributions in respect of the Collateral will be shared
ratably among the Notes Secured Parties, the Credit Agreement Secured Parties and any Future First Lien Secured
Parties, and (2) for certain procedures for exercising rights and remedies in respect of the Liens on the Collateral.

Pursuant to the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, the Applicable Collateral Agent (acting on the
instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative) has the right to direct foreclosures, enforcements and take
other actions with respect to the Collateral, and the Collateral Agent (unless the Collateral Agent is then acting as
the Applicable Collateral Agent) and the other Authorized Representatives of other Series of First Lien Obligations
have no right to take actions with respect to the Collateral. The Applicable Authorized Representative will initially
be the Credit Agreement Administrative Agent, as Authorized Representative in respect of the Credit Agreement
Obligations, and neither the Trustee nor the Collateral Agent will have any right to take any action with respect to
the Collateral under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. The Credit Agreement Administrative Agent will remain


-----

the Applicable Authorized Representative until the earlier of (1) the Discharge of Credit Agreement Obligations
(without replacement of the Credit Agreement Obligations) and (2) the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative
Enforcement Date (such date, the “Applicable Authorized Agent Change Date”). After the Applicable Authorized
Agent Change Date, the Applicable Authorized Representative will be the Authorized Representative of the Series
of First Lien Obligations (other than the Credit Agreement Obligations) that constitutes the largest outstanding
principal amount of any then outstanding Series of First Lien Obligations (other than the Credit Agreement
Obligations) (the “Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative”).

The “Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date” is the date that is 120 days (throughout which
120-day period the Applicable Authorized Representative was the Major Non-Controlling Authorized
Representative) after the occurrence of both (a) an event of default, as defined in the indenture or other governing
agreement for that Series of First Lien Obligations, and (b) the Trustee’s and each other Authorized Representative’s
receipt of written notice from that Authorized Representative certifying that (i) such Authorized Representative is
the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative and that an event of default, as defined in the indenture or
other governing agreement for that Series of First Lien Obligations, has occurred and is continuing and (ii) the First
Lien Obligations of that Series are currently due and payable in full (whether as a result of acceleration thereof or
otherwise) in accordance with the indenture or other governing agreement for that Series of First Lien Obligations;
provided that the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date shall be stayed and shall not occur
and shall be deemed not to have occurred with respect to any Collateral (1) at any time the Credit Agreement
Administrative Agent or the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent has commenced and is diligently pursuing any
enforcement action with respect to such Collateral or (2) at any time the Issuer or any Guarantor that has granted a
security interest in such Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any Insolvency
Proceeding.

With respect to any Collateral, (i) the Applicable Collateral Agent shall act only on the instructions of the
Applicable Authorized Representative, (ii) the Applicable Collateral Agent shall not follow any instructions with
respect to such Collateral from any Non-Controlling Authorized Representative (or any other First Lien Secured
Party other than the Applicable Authorized Representative) and (iii) no Non-Controlling Authorized Representative
or other First Lien Secured Party (other than the Applicable Authorized Representative) shall or shall instruct the
Applicable Collateral Agent to, commence any judicial or nonjudicial enforcement or foreclosure proceedings with
respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, interim receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or over,
attempt any action to take possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise take any
action to enforce its security interest in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of, any
Collateral. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) in any Insolvency Proceeding, the Collateral Agent or any other First
Lien Secured Party may file a proof of claim or statement of interest with respect to the First Lien Obligations owed
to such First Lien Secured Party; (ii) the Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party may take any action
to preserve or protect the validity and enforceability of the Liens granted in favor of such First Lien Secured Parties,
provided that no such action is, or could reasonably be expected to be, (A) adverse, in any material respect, to the
Liens granted in favor of the Controlling Secured Parties or the rights of the Applicable Collateral Agent or any
other Controlling Secured Parties to exercise remedies in respect thereof or (B) otherwise inconsistent with the terms
of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement; and (iii) the Collateral Agent or any First Lien Secured Party may file any
responsive or defensive pleadings in opposition to any motion, claim, adversary proceeding or other pleading made
by any person objecting to or otherwise seeking the disallowance of the claims or Liens of such First Lien Secured
Party, including any claims secured by the Collateral, in each case, to the extent not inconsistent with the terms of
the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

Notwithstanding anything in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement or any other documents relating to the security
granted with respect to the Credit Agreement Obligations to the contrary, Collateral consisting of cash and Cash
Equivalents pledged to secure the Credit Agreement Obligations consisting of reimbursement obligations in respect
of Letters of Credit (as defined in the Credit Agreement) (solely to the extent pledged for the benefit of the relevant
Letter of Credit issuer and any participants therein) shall be applied as specified in the Credit Agreement and will
not constitute Shared Collateral.

Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens on the Collateral, the Applicable Collateral Agent (acting on the
instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative), may deal with the Collateral as if such Applicable
Collateral Agent had a senior Lien on such Collateral. No representative of any Non-Controlling Secured Party may
contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the Applicable Collateral Agent, the
Applicable Authorized Representative or the Controlling Secured Party. Each of the First Lien Secured Parties also


-----

will agree that it will not (and will waive any right to) question or contest or support any other Person in contesting,
in any proceeding (including any Insolvency Proceeding), the perfection, priority, validity, attachment or
enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf of any of the First Lien Secured Parties on all or any part of the
Collateral or the provisions of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and the Applicable Collateral Agent or any other First Lien
Secured Party is taking action to enforce rights in respect of any Collateral, or any distribution is made in respect of
any Collateral in any Insolvency Proceeding of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including any adequate protection
payments) or any of the holders of the Notes, the Credit Agreement Secured Parties and the holders of any other
First Lien Obligations receives any payment pursuant to any intercreditor agreement (other than the First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement) with respect to any Collateral, the proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of
any such Collateral by any Authorized Representative or any holder of First Lien Obligations or received by any
Authorized Representative pursuant to such intercreditor agreement with respect to any Collateral and proceeds of
any such distribution (after payment of the costs of enforcement and collateral administration) (subject, in the case
of any such payments, proceeds or distribution, to the sentence immediately following) to which the First Lien
Obligations are entitled under any intercreditor agreement (other than the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) shall
be distributed ratably to the applicable Authorized Representatives for further distribution to the holders of the Notes
and the Notes Obligations, the holders of Credit Agreement Obligations and the holders of any Future First Lien
Indebtedness after payment of all amounts owing to the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent, the Collateral Agent
and each collateral agent with respect to Future First Lien Obligations; provided that following the commencement
of any Insolvency Proceeding with respect to the Issuer or any Guarantor, solely as among the holders of First Lien
Obligations and solely for purposes of the corresponding paragraph in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and
not any other documents governing First Lien Obligations, in the event the value of the Collateral is not sufficient
for the entire amount of post-petition interest, fees, or expenses on the First Lien Obligations to be allowed under
Section 506(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other
Bankruptcy Law in such Insolvency Proceeding, the amount of First Lien Obligations of each Series of First Lien
Obligations shall include only the maximum amount of post-petition interest, fees, or expenses on the First Lien
Obligations allowable under Section 506(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable provision of the
Bankruptcy Code or other Bankruptcy Law in such Insolvency Proceeding.

The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement will provide it is the intention of the First Lien Secured Parties of each Series
that the holders of First Lien Obligations of such Series (and not the First Lien Secured Parties of any other Series)
bear the risk of (i) any determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that (x) any of the First Lien Obligations
of such Series are unenforceable under applicable law or are subordinated to any other obligations (other than
another Series of First Lien Obligations), (y) any of the First Lien Obligations of such Series do not have a valid and
perfected security interest in any of the Collateral securing any other Series of First Lien Obligations and/or (z) any
intervening security interest exists securing any other obligations (other than another Series of First Lien
Obligations) on a basis ranking prior to the security interest of such Series of First Lien Obligations but junior to the
security interest of any other Series of First Lien Obligations or (ii) the existence of any Collateral for any other
Series of First Lien Obligations that is not Collateral for such Series of First Lien Obligations (any such condition
referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii) with respect to any Series of First Lien Obligations, an “Impairment” of
such Series). In the event of any Impairment with respect to any Series of First Lien Obligations, the results of such
Impairment shall be borne solely by the holders of such Series of First Lien Obligations, and the rights of the holders
of such Series of First Lien Obligations (including, without limitation, the right to receive distributions in respect of
such Series of First Lien Obligations pursuant to the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) set forth herein
shall be modified to the extent necessary so that the effects of such Impairment are borne solely by the holders of the
Series of such First Lien Obligations subject to such Impairment. Additionally, in the event the First Lien
Obligations of any Series are modified pursuant to applicable law (including, without limitation, pursuant to Section
1129 of the Bankruptcy Code or any equivalent provision of any other Bankruptcy Law), any reference to such First
Lien Obligations or the First Lien Documents governing such First Lien Obligations shall refer to such obligations
or such documents as so modified.

If, at any time the Applicable Collateral Agent forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any
Collateral resulting in a sale or disposition thereof, then (whether or not any Insolvency Proceeding is pending at the
time) the Collateral Agent’s Liens on such Collateral will automatically be released and discharged as and when, but
only to the extent, the Applicable Collateral Agent’s Liens on such Collateral are released and discharged. The
Collateral Agent will execute and deliver all such authorizations and other instruments as shall be reasonably


-----

requested by the Applicable Collateral Agent (at the Issuer’s and the Guarantor’s sole cost and expense) to evidence
and confirm any such release.

Under the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, if the Collateral Agent or the holders of the Notes (or any
Authorized Representative in respect of, or any holders of, any other First Lien Obligations) shall obtain possession
of any Collateral or shall realize any proceeds or payment in respect of any such Collateral, pursuant to any First
Lien Document or by the exercise of any rights available to it under applicable law or in any Insolvency Proceeding
or through any other exercise of remedies (including pursuant to any intercreditor agreement), at any time prior to
the discharge of each of the First Lien Obligations, then it shall hold such Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust
for the other First Lien Secured Parties and promptly transfer such Collateral, proceeds or payment, as the case may
be, to the Applicable Collateral Agent, to be distributed in accordance with the provisions of the terms of the First
Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

If the Issuer and/or any Guarantor shall become subject to a case or proceeding (an “Insolvency Proceeding”) under
Bankruptcy Law and shall, as debtor(s)-in-possession, move or be the subject of a motion for approval of financing
(in this section, a “DIP Financing”) to be provided by one or more lenders (the “DIP Lenders”) under Section 364 of
the Bankruptcy Code, 11.2 of the CCAA, 50.6 of the BIA or any equivalent provision of any other Bankruptcy Law
and/or the use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code or any equivalent provision of any other
Bankruptcy Law, each holder of First Lien Obligations (other than the Applicable Authorized Representative or any
holder of First Lien Obligations in the Series of First Lien Obligations whose collateral agent is the Applicable
Authorized Representative for such Collateral (a “Controlling Secured Party”)) will agree that it will raise no
objection to any such financing or to the Liens (including court-ordered charges) on the Collateral securing the same
(“DIP Financing Liens”) or to any use of cash collateral that constitutes Collateral unless the Applicable Collateral
Agent shall then oppose or object to such DIP Financing or such DIP Financing Liens and/or use of cash collateral
(and (i) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens are senior to the Liens on any such Collateral for the benefit of
the Controlling Secured Parties, each holder of First Lien Obligations that is not a Controlling Secured Party with
respect to such Collateral (a “Non-Controlling Secured Party”) will subordinate its Liens with respect to such
Collateral on the same terms as the Liens of the Controlling Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any holders of
First Lien Obligations constituting DIP Financing Liens) are subordinated thereto, and (ii) to the extent that such
DIP Financing Liens rank pari passu with the Liens on any such Collateral granted to secure the First Lien
Obligations of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will confirm the priorities with
respect to such Collateral as set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement), in each case so long as (A) the
holders of First Lien Obligations of each Series retain the benefit of their Liens on all such Collateral pledged to the
DIP Lenders, including proceeds, products, offspring, profits or rents, as applicable, thereof arising after the
commencement of such proceeding, with the same priority vis-a-vis all the other holders of First Lien Obligations
(other than any Liens of any holders of First Lien Obligations constituting DIP Financing Liens) as existed prior to
the commencement of the Insolvency Proceeding, (B) the holders of First Lien Obligations of each Series are
granted Liens on any additional or replacement collateral pledged to any holders of First Lien Obligations as
adequate protection or otherwise in connection with such DIP Financing and/or use of cash collateral, with the same
priority vis-a-vis the Liens of the other holders of First Lien Obligations as set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement (other than any Liens of any holders of First Lien Obligations constituting DIP Financing Liens), (C) if
any amount of such DIP Financing and/or cash collateral is applied to repay any of the First Lien Obligations, such
amount is applied pursuant to the “waterfall provisions” of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and (D) if any
holders of First Lien Obligations are granted adequate protection with respect to the First Lien Obligations subject to
the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, including in the form of periodic payments, in connection with such DIP
Financing and/or use of cash collateral, the proceeds of such adequate protection are applied pursuant to the terms of
the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement; provided that the holders of First Lien Obligations of each Series shall have
a right to object to the grant of a Lien to secure the DIP Financing over any Collateral subject to Liens in favor of
the holders of First Lien Obligations of such Series or its Authorized Representative that shall not constitute
Collateral; provided, further, that the holders of First Lien Obligations receiving adequate protection shall not object
to any other holder of First Lien Obligations receiving adequate protection comparable to any adequate protection
granted to such holders in connection with a DIP Financing and/or use of cash collateral.

**Additional Amounts**

All payments in respect of the Notes or any Guarantee by or on behalf of the Issuer, any Guarantor, or any successor
thereto (each, a “Payor”) shall be made free and clear of, and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of,
any present or future taxes, levies, duties, imposts, assessments or other governmental charges, including any


-----

interest, additions to tax and penalties related thereto (collectively, “Taxes”), unless such withholding or deduction
is required by applicable law.

If any Payor, or any other applicable withholding agent, is required to withhold or deduct any amount in respect of
any payment made in respect of the Notes or any Guarantee with respect to any Tax imposed by or on behalf of any
jurisdiction in which any Payor is, at any time, organized, resident or doing business for tax purposes, or any
jurisdiction from or through which any Payor or any paying agent (on behalf of any Payor) makes any payments on
the Notes or any Guarantee, or, in each case, any governmental authority or political subdivision thereof or therein
having the power to tax (each, a “Relevant Tax Jurisdiction”), the Payor will, subject to the exceptions and
limitations set forth below, pay such additional amounts (“Additional Amounts”) as are necessary so that the net
payment received by a beneficial owner of the Notes (including any Additional Amounts), after withholding or
deduction for any Taxes of any Relevant Tax Jurisdiction (including in respect of any Additional Amounts) will
equal the amount such beneficial owner would have received in respect of such payment had no such withholding or
deduction been required. A Payor’s obligation to pay Additional Amounts shall not apply:

(a) to any Taxes that are imposed by reason of the holder (or the beneficial owner for whose benefit such holder
holds such Note), or a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of the holder if the holder is an
estate, trust, partnership or corporation, or a person holding a power over an estate or trust administered by a
fiduciary holder, being considered as:

(i) being or having been engaged in a trade or business in the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction or having or having
had a permanent establishment in the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction; or

(ii) having any other current or former connection with the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction (other than a connection
arising solely as a result of the acquisition, ownership or disposition of the Notes or a beneficial interest
therein, the receipt of any payment in respect of a Note or any Guarantee or the enforcement of any
rights hereunder or thereunder), including being or having been a citizen or resident of the Relevant Tax
Jurisdiction;

(b) to any Taxes that are imposed or withheld because the holder or beneficial owner failed to accurately comply
with a request from a Payor to meet certification, identification or information or other reporting requirements
concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the holder or beneficial owner of the Notes or otherwise
establish any available exemption from or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, such Taxes (if
such holder or beneficial owner is legally eligible to satisfy such requirements, exemptions or reductions), in
each case, if compliance with such action is required as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in,
such Tax by a Relevant Tax Jurisdiction;

(c) to any Taxes that are imposed other than by withholding or deduction by a Payor or other applicable
withholding agent in respect of a payment with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee;

(d) to any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, wealth or similar Taxes;

(e) to any Taxes that are imposed as a result of the presentation of a Note for payment (where presentation is
required) more than 30 days after the relevant amount is first made available for payment to the holder (except
to the extent that the holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Note been presented on
the last day of such 30-day period);

(f) to any Canadian withholding Taxes that are imposed on payment on the Notes or Guarantees under the
Income Tax Act (Canada) as a result of (i) the holder or beneficial owner not dealing at arm’s length (for the
purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada)) with the Issuer at the time such payment is made, or (ii) the holder
or beneficial owner being a “specified non-resident shareholder” (as defined in subsection 18(5) of the
Income Tax Act (Canada)) of the Issuer at the time of payment or not dealing at arm’s length (for the purposes
of the Income Tax Act (Canada)) with a “specified shareholder” (as defined in subsection 18(5) of the Income
Tax Act (Canada)) of the Issuer at the time of payment, as applicable;

(g) to any Tax imposed pursuant to current Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (or any amended or successor
version that is substantively comparable and not materially more onerous to comply with), any current or
future regulations or official interpretations thereof, any agreement entered into pursuant to current Section
1471(b) of the Code (or any amended or successor version described above), or any intergovernmental
agreements, treaties, conventions or similar agreements (and any related laws, regulations or administrative
guidance) implementing the foregoing;


-----

(h) to any Taxes that are imposed on or with respect to any payment by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor
to the holder if such holder is a fiduciary, partnership, limited liability company or person other than the sole
beneficial owner of such payment to the extent that, had the sole beneficial owner of such Note been the
holder and had such Taxes been imposed on the sole beneficial owner, no Additional Amounts in respect of
such Taxes would have been payable as a result of clauses (a)-(g) or (i) of this “Additional Amounts” section;
or

(i) to any combination of the above items (the foregoing Taxes described in clauses (a)-(i), “Excluded Taxes”).

For purposes of this Additional Amounts section, including clause (c) above, any Tax imposed pursuant to
Regulation 803 of the Income Tax Act (Canada) shall be treated as a Tax withheld by an applicable withholding
agent even though such tax is payable directly by the holder or beneficial owner.

At least 30 calendar days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the Notes or any
Guarantee is due and payable, if a Payor will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to such payment
(unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises after the 35th day prior to the date on which such payment
is due and payable, in which case it will be promptly thereafter), the Payor will deliver to the Trustee a certificate of
an officer of the Issuer stating that such Additional Amounts will be payable and the amounts so payable and will set
forth such other information necessary to enable the Trustee (or the applicable paying agent) to pay such Additional
Amounts to holders on the payment date.

The applicable Payor, if it is the applicable withholding agent, will make any required withholding or deduction and
remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The
Issuer will provide the Trustees (and, upon request, any holders or beneficial owners of the Notes) with official
receipts or other documentation evidencing the payment of the Taxes with respect to which Additional Amounts are
paid.

The Issuer and the Guarantors will pay and indemnify each holder of Notes for any present or future stamp, court,
issue, registration or documentary Taxes or any other excise, property or similar Taxes that are levied by any
Relevant Tax Jurisdiction from the execution, delivery, enforcement or registration of the Notes (other than in
respect of a transfer of a Note, to someone other than the Issuer or its Affiliates, that occurs after the sale of such
Note to an investor pursuant to this offering), the Guarantees, the indenture or any other document or instrument in
relation thereof, or the receipt of any payments with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee (limited, solely in the
case of Taxes attributable to the receipt of any payments with respect thereto, to any such Taxes levied by a
Relevant Tax Jurisdiction that are not excluded under clauses (a), (b) and (d) through (h) or any combination
thereof). Whenever in the indenture there is mentioned in any context: the payment of principal, redemption prices
or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of Notes, interest, or any other amount payable with
respect to any of the Notes or any Guarantee, such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional
Amounts as described under this heading to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would
be payable in respect thereof.

The above obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the indenture, and any transfer by a
holder or beneficial owner of its Notes and will apply mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, to any Payor and to
any jurisdiction in which such successor is organized or is otherwise resident or doing business for tax purposes or
any jurisdiction from or through which payment is made by such successor or its respective agents.

**Optional Redemption**

_General.  Except as provided below and under the heading “Change of Control”, the Notes will not be redeemable_
at our option prior to        , 2022. Thereafter, the Notes will be subject to redemption at our option, in whole or
in part, upon not less than 10 days’ or more than 60 days’ notice, at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages
of principal amount) set forth below, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the applicable redemption
date (subject to the rights of holders of record of the Notes on the relevant record date to receive payments of
interest on the related interest payment date), if redeemed during the 12-month period beginning on         of the
years indicated below:


-----

**Year** **Percentage**

2022 .................................................................................................................................................... %

2023 .................................................................................................................................................... %
2024 and thereafter ............................................................................................................................. 100.000%

_Equity sales.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time and from time to time prior to        , 2022, we may_
redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding at a redemption price equal to   % of
the principal amount thereof on the repurchase date, together with accrued and unpaid interest to such redemption
date (subject to the rights of holders of record of the Notes on the relevant record date to receive payments of
interest on the related interest payment date), with an amount equal to the net cash proceeds of one or more public or
private sales of Qualified Capital Stock (each an “Equity Offering”), other than proceeds from a sale to the Issuer or
any of its Subsidiaries or any employee benefit plan in which the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries participates;
_provided that:_

- at least 60% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes originally issued remains outstanding immediately after
the occurrence of such redemption (including Additional Notes but excluding Notes held by the Issuer or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries) unless all such Notes are redeemed substantially concurrently; and

- such redemption occurs no later than the 120[th] day following such sale of Qualified Capital Stock.

_Make whole.  In addition, at any time and from time to time prior to        , 2022, we may redeem all or any_
portion of the Notes outstanding at a redemption price equal to:

- 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, together with accrued and unpaid interest
to such redemption date (subject to the rights of holders of record of the Notes on the relevant record date to
receive payments of interest on the related interest payment date), plus

- the Make Whole Amount.

“Make Whole Amount” means, with respect to any Note at any redemption date, as determined by us, the greater of
(i) 1.0% of the principal amount of such Note and (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) an amount equal to the present value
of (1) the redemption price of such Note at        , 2022 plus (2) the remaining scheduled interest payments on
the Notes to be redeemed (subject to the right of holders on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
relevant interest payment date) to        , 2022 (other than interest accrued to the redemption date), computed
using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate plus 50 basis points, over (B) the principal amount of the Notes to
be redeemed. The Trustee shall have no obligation to calculate or verify the calculation of the Make Whole Amount.

“Treasury Rate” means, at the time of computation as calculated by us, the weekly average for each business day
during the most recent week that has ended at least two business days prior to the redemption date of the yield to
maturity of United States Treasury Securities with a constant maturity (as compiled and published in the most recent
Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (or, if such statistical release is not so published or available or the relevant
information no longer available thereon, any publicly available source of similar market data selected by the Issuer
in good faith) most nearly equal to the period from the redemption date to        , 2022; provided, however, that
if the period from the redemption date to        , 2022 is not equal to the constant maturity of a United States
Treasury security for which a yield is given, the Treasury Rate shall be obtained by linear interpolation (calculated
to the nearest one-twelfth of a year) from the yields of United States Treasury Securities for which such yields are
given, except that if the period from the redemption date to        , 2022 is less than one year, the weekly
average yield on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year shall
be used.

In connection with any redemption of Notes described above, such redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be
subject to one or more conditions precedent, including any related Equity Offering, issuance of Indebtedness or
other transaction. If such redemption or notice is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such
notice shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded,
or the redemption date may be delayed or extended, in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been
satisfied by the redemption date.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Notes, including a Change of Control
Offer, if holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do
not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer or Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third party making


-----

such tender offer or Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60
days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase date, to redeem all Notes that remain
outstanding following such purchase at a redemption price equal to the price offered to each other holder (excluding
any early tender or incentive fee) in such tender offer or Change of Control Offer plus, to the extent not included in
the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the date of such redemption.

_Tax Redemption. If (a) the Issuer or any Guarantor becomes or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts_
with respect to any Notes or any Guarantee (as described under the heading “—Additional Amounts” above) as a
result of (1) any change in, or amendment to, the laws, treaties (including protocols), regulations or rulings of a
Relevant Tax Jurisdiction, which change or amendment is first publicly announced and becomes effective after the
Issue Date (or, if the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction did not become a Relevant Tax Jurisdiction until a later date, after
such later date) or (2) any change in the official interpretation or application of the laws, treaties (including
protocols), regulations or rulings of a Relevant Tax Jurisdiction (including by virtue of a holding, judgment or order
by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice), which change is first publicly
announced and becomes effective after the Issue Date (or, if the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction did not become a
Relevant Tax Jurisdiction until a later date, after such later date), and (b) such obligation cannot be avoided by the
Issuer’s taking reasonable measures available to the Issuer or any Guarantor (provided that changing the jurisdiction
of the Issuer or any Guarantor is not a reasonable measure for this purpose), the Issuer may at its option, having
given not less than 30 days’ notice to the holders of such Notes (which notice shall be irrevocable), redeem all, but
not a portion of, the Notes at any time a price equal to their principal amount plus interest accrued to, but excluding,
the date of redemption (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on
the relevant interest payment date), provided that no such notice of redemption shall be given earlier than 60 days
prior to the earliest date on which the Issuer or any Guarantor would be obliged to pay such Additional Amounts
were a payment in respect of the Notes then due); and provided further that in the case of a Guarantor, no
redemption shall be permitted under this “Tax Redemption” section if the Issuer or any other Guarantor can make
payments on the Notes without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts. Prior to the publication or, where
relevant, mailing of any notice of redemption pursuant to this paragraph, the Issuer shall deliver to the Trustee (i) a
certificate of an officer of the Issuer stating that the requirements described in clauses (a) and (b) above are satisfied,
and (ii) an opinion of an independent counsel of recognized standing to the effect that the Issuer or any Guarantor
has or will become obliged to pay such Additional Amounts as a result of a change or amendment described in
clause (a) above. The Trustee shall accept, and will be entitled to rely on, such certificate and opinion of counsel as
sufficient evidence of the existence and satisfaction of the conditions described in clauses (a) and (b) above, and
upon such acceptance by the Trustee the Issuer will be entitled to give notice of redemption hereunder and such
notice of redemption will be conclusive and binding on the holders of the Notes.

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, selection of Notes for redemption will be made on a pro
_rata basis, or, in the case of a redemption other than as described under “—Optional Redemption—Equity sales,” by_
lot; provided that all redemptions of interest in global notes held by the depositary shall be made in accordance with
the procedures of the depositary; provided that no Notes with a principal amount of $2,000 or less shall be redeemed
in part. Notice of redemption will be transmitted at least 10 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to
each holder of Notes to be redeemed at its registered address. If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice
of redemption that relates to such Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. On
and after the redemption date, so long as we do not default in the payment of the redemption price, interest will
cease to accrue on Notes or portions thereof called for redemption.

**Change of Control**

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, we will be required to make an offer (a “Change of Control Offer”) to
each holder of Notes to repurchase all or any part (equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof) of such holder’s
Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid
interest thereon to the date of repurchase (subject to the rights of holders of record of the Notes on the relevant
record date to receive payments of interest on the related interest payment date) (in either case, the “Change of
Control Payment”). Within 30 days following any Change of Control, we will be required to send a notice to each
holder electronically in accordance with the procedures of the depository or by first-class mail with a copy to the
Trustee stating:


-----

(1) that the Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the covenant described under “—Change of
Control”;

(2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which shall be no earlier than 30 days and not later than 60 days
after the date such notice is sent (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) that any Notes not tendered will continue to accrue interest in accordance with the terms of the indenture;

(4) that, unless we default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Notes accepted for payment
pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date;

(5) that holders will be entitled to withdraw their election if the paying agent receives, not later than the close of
business on the second business day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date, a notice sent
electronically in accordance with the procedures of the depository or by first-class mail setting forth the name
of the holder, the principal amount of Notes delivered for purchase, and a statement that such holder is
unconditionally withdrawing its election to have such Notes purchased;

(6) that holders whose Notes are being purchased only in part will be issued new Notes equal in principal amount
to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, which unpurchased portion must be equal to $2,000 in
principal amount or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof; and

(7) any other information material to such holder’s decision to tender Notes.

We will be required to comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities
laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the
repurchase of the Notes required in the event of a Change of Control and will not be deemed to have violated the
“Change of Control” provisions of the indenture as a result of such compliance. We will not be required to make a
Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the
manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the indenture applicable to
Change of Control Offer made by us. Our obligations in respect of a Change of Control Offer can be modified with
the consent of holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding at any time prior to
the occurrence of a Change of Control. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer
may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement
is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer.

Due to our leveraged structure and the terms of other indebtedness to which we and our Subsidiaries are or may in
the future be subject, we may not be able to repurchase all of the Notes tendered upon a Change of Control. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—Upon a change of control, we may not have the funds necessary to
finance the change of control offer required by the indenture governing the notes, which would violate the terms of
the notes.” If we fail to repurchase all of the Notes tendered for purchase upon a Change of Control, such failure will
constitute an Event of Default. In addition, the occurrence of certain of the events which would constitute a Change
of Control would constitute an event of default under the Credit Agreement and may constitute an event of default
under future Indebtedness. Moreover, the exercise by the holders of their right to require us to purchase the Notes
could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial
effect of the repurchase on us. Finally, our ability to pay cash to the holders upon a Change of Control may be
limited by our then existing financial resources.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a phrase relating to the sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease
or other disposition of “all or substantially all” of our assets. Although there is a developing body of case law
interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable
law. Accordingly, if we dispose of less than all our assets by any of the means described above, the ability of a
holder of Notes to require us to repurchase its Notes may be uncertain.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the indenture will not contain any provisions that
permit the holders of the Notes to require that we repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover,
recapitalization or similar transaction.

**Certain Covenants**

_Limitation on Restricted Payments._

The indenture will provide that neither we nor any of our Restricted Subsidiaries may, directly or indirectly:


-----

(a) pay any dividend or make any distribution on account of any Equity Interests of us other than dividends or

(iii) such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate of all other Restricted Payments made after the
Issue Date, is less than the sum of:

Income shall be a deficit, minus 100% of such aggregate deficit); plus

(B) an amount equal to the sum of (x) 100% of the aggregate net cash proceeds and the Fair Market
Value of any property or assets received by us from the issue or sale of Equity Interests (other
than Disqualified Stock) of us (other than Equity Interests sold to any of our Subsidiaries),
following the Issue Date and (y) the aggregate amount by which Indebtedness (other than any
Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Subsidiary) incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary on or subsequent to the Issue Date is reduced on the Issuer’s balance sheet upon the
conversion or exchange into Qualified Capital Stock (less the amount of any cash, or the Fair
Market Value of assets, distributed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary upon such
conversion or exchange or expended pursuant to clause (11) of the following paragraph); plus

(C) if any Unrestricted Subsidiary is designated by us as a Restricted Subsidiary, an amount equal to
the Fair Market Value of the net Investment by us or a Restricted Subsidiary in such Subsidiary at
the time of such designation; provided, however, that the foregoing amount shall not exceed the
amount of Restricted Investments made by us or any Restricted Subsidiary in any such
Unrestricted Subsidiary following the Issue Date which reduced the amount available for
Restricted Payments pursuant to this clause (iii) less amounts received by us or any Restricted
Subsidiary from such Unrestricted Subsidiary that increased the amount available for Restricted
Payments pursuant to clause (D) below; plus

(D) 100% of any cash dividends and other cash distributions and the Fair Market Value of property or
assets other than cash received by us and our Restricted Subsidiaries from an Unrestricted
Subsidiary since the Issue Date to the extent not included in Consolidated EBITDA and 100% of
the net proceeds received by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries from the sale of any
Unrestricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that the foregoing amount shall not exceed the
amount of Restricted Investments made by us or any Restricted Subsidiary in any such
Unrestricted Subsidiary following the Issue Date which reduced the amount available for
Restricted Payments pursuant to this clause (iii); plus


-----

(E) to the extent not included in clauses (A) through (D) above, an amount equal to the net reduction
in Restricted Investments of us and our Restricted Subsidiaries following the Issue Date resulting
from payments in cash of interest on Indebtedness, dividends, or repayment of loans or advances,
or other transfers of property, in each case, to us or to a Restricted Subsidiary or from the net cash
proceeds from the sale, conveyance, liquidation or other disposition of any such Restricted
Investment; plus

(F) $20.0 million.

The foregoing provisions will not prohibit the following (provided that with respect to clauses (9), (10) and (12)
below, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing both before and after giving effect to
such Restricted Payment):

(1) the payment of any dividend or distribution or the consummation of any irrevocable redemption within 60
days after the date of declaration thereof or the giving of a redemption notice related thereto, if at the date of
declaration or notice such payment, dividend, distribution or redemption would have complied with the
provisions of the indenture;

(2) the redemption, repurchase, retirement or other acquisition of (x) any Equity Interests of us in exchange for, or
out of the net proceeds of the issue or sale within 60 days of, Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock)

any Restricted Subsidiary (a) in exchange for, or out of the proceeds of the issuance and sale within 60 days
of, Qualified Capital Stock, (b) in exchange for, or out of the proceeds of the incurrence within 60 days of,

incurred under such covenant or (c) with the Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale or upon a Change of Control, in
each case, to the extent required by the agreement governing such Subordinated Indebtedness but only if we
shall have previously applied such Net Proceeds to make an Excess Proceeds Offer or made a Change of
Control Offer, as the case may be, in accordance with “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales” or
“—Change of Control” and purchased all Notes validly tendered pursuant to the relevant offer prior to
redeeming or repurchasing such Subordinated Indebtedness;

(3) the declaration and payment of dividends to holders of any class or series of Disqualified Stock of the Issuer
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or shares of Preferred Equity Interests of any Restricted Subsidiary issued
in accordance with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of
Indebtedness”;

(4) repurchases of Equity Interests deemed to occur upon exercise of stock options or warrants or upon the vesting
of restricted stock units if such Equity Interests represent the exercise price of such options or warrants or
represent withholding taxes due upon such exercise or vesting;

(5) [Reserved];

(6) the repurchase, retirement or other acquisition for value of Equity Interests of the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary of the Issuer held by any future, present or former employee, director, officer, advisor or consultant

greater of (x) $7.5 million and (y) 10.0% of Consolidated EBITDA for the most recently ended Measurement
Period (calculated on a pro forma basis) in any calendar year, with unused amounts in any calendar year
carried over and available for use in any succeeding calendar year; provided, further, that such amount in any
calendar year may be increased by an amount not to exceed:

(a) the cash proceeds from the sale of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Issuer to any
future, present or former employee, director, officer, consultant or advisor of the Issuer or any of its
Subsidiaries that occurred after the Issue Date, to the extent the cash proceeds from the sale of such
Capital Stock have not otherwise been applied to the payment of Restricted Payments by virtue of clause
(iii) of the preceding paragraph; plus


-----

(b) the cash proceeds of key man life insurance policies received by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries
after the Issue Date; less

(c) the amount of any Restricted Payments made in previous calendar years pursuant to clauses (a) and (b) of
this clause;

_provided that the Issuer may elect to apply all or any portion of the aggregate increase contemplated by_
subclauses (a) and (b) of this clause (6) in any fiscal year; provided, further, that (i) cancellation of
Indebtedness owing to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary from any future, present or former employee,
director, officer, consultant or advisor of the Issuer or Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with a repurchase
of Capital Stock of the Issuer and (ii) the repurchase of Capital Stock deemed to occur upon the exercise of
options, warrants or similar instruments if such Capital Stock represents all or a portion of the exercise price
thereof and payments, in lieu of the issuance of fractional shares of such Capital Stock or withholding to pay
other taxes payable in connection therewith, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii), will not be deemed to
constitute a Restricted Payment for purposes of this covenant or any other provision of the Indenture;

Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer’s most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for
which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such Designated
Preferred Stock is issued, after giving effect to such issuance (and the payment of dividends or distributions)
on a pro forma basis, would have been at least 2.00 to 1.00 and (b) the aggregate amount of dividends
declared and paid pursuant to this clause (9) does not exceed the net cash proceeds actually received by the
Issuer from any such sale of Designated Preferred Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) issued after the Issue
Date;

(10) any Restricted Payment if after giving effect to such Restricted Payment, the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of
the Issuer on a pro forma basis is equal to or less than 3.75 to 1.00;

Restricted Payments made pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant and clause (1) of the second paragraph of
this covenant and, to the extent made with the proceeds of the issuance of Qualified Capital Stock, Investments
made pursuant to clause (j) of the definition of “Permitted Investments” shall be included as Restricted Payments in
any computation made pursuant to clause (iii) of the first paragraph of this covenant. Restricted Payments made
pursuant to clauses (2) through (10) and (12) of the second paragraph of this covenant shall not be included as
Restricted Payments in any computation made pursuant to clause (iii) of the first paragraph of this covenant.

If we or any Restricted Subsidiary makes a Restricted Investment and the Person in which such Investment was
made subsequently becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, to the extent such Investment resulted in a reduction in the
amounts calculated under clause (iii) of the first paragraph of or under any other provision of this covenant (which
was not subsequently reversed), then such amount shall be increased by the amount of such reduction.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a Restricted Payment (or portion
thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories described in the clauses above, or is permitted pursuant
to the first paragraph of this covenant the Issuer will be entitled to divide or classify (or later divide, classify or
reclassify in whole or in part in its sole discretion) such Restricted Payment (or portion thereof) in any manner that
complies with this covenant.


-----

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of such Restricted
Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The fair market value of any cash Restricted
Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any non-cash Restricted Payment, property or assets
other than cash shall be determined conclusively by the Issuer acting in good faith.

If the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary makes a Restricted Payment which at the time of the making of such
Restricted Payment would in the good faith determination of the Issuer be permitted under the provisions of the
Indenture, such Restricted Payment shall be deemed to have been made in compliance with the Indenture
notwithstanding any subsequent adjustments made in good faith to the Issuer’s financial statements affecting
Consolidated Net Income or Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer for any period.

_Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness_

The indenture will provide that we shall not, and shall not permit any of our Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or
indirectly, create, incur, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable with respect to
(collectively, “incur”) any Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) or permit any of our Restricted Subsidiaries to
issue any Preferred Equity Interests; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer and any
Restricted Subsidiary may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) and any Guarantor may issue Preferred
Equity Interests, if, after giving effect to the incurrence of such Indebtedness or the issuance of such Preferred
Equity Interests and the application of the net proceeds thereof on a pro forma basis, our Consolidated Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0; provided that Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer that are not
Guarantors may not incur Indebtedness or issue any Preferred Equity Interests pursuant to this paragraph if, after
giving pro forma effect to such incurrence or issuance (including a pro forma application of the net proceeds
therefrom), the aggregate amount of outstanding Indebtedness or Preferred Equity Interests of Restricted
Subsidiaries of the Issuer that are not Guarantors at any one time outstanding incurred pursuant to the foregoing
proviso and pursuant to clause 4(a) of the next paragraph, together with the amount of any Refinancing Indebtedness
in respect thereof incurred pursuant to clause (10) of the next paragraph, exceeds the greater of (x) $20.0 million or

recently ended Measurement Period (calculated on a pro forma basis) and (b) an amount that would not cause
the Consolidated First Lien Indebtedness Leverage Ratio (calculated after giving pro forma effect to the
incurrence of such Indebtedness, the application of proceeds therefrom, the granting of such Liens and any
other related transactions) to be greater than 5.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of the most recent quarter for which
internal financial statements are available on the date such Indebtedness is incurred, plus the amount of any
accrued interest and any premiums payable and reasonable fees, expenses, commissions and costs in

Acquired Debt of a Person incurred prior to the date upon which such Person was acquired by us or any
Restricted Subsidiary (and not created in contemplation of such acquisition); provided that after giving effect
to the incurrence of such Indebtedness or Acquired Debt on a pro forma basis, our Consolidated Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio either (A) would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0 or (B) would have been greater than
immediately prior to such acquisition; provided, further, that all Indebtedness incurred, issued or assumed
pursuant to subclause (4)(a) and pursuant to the proviso in the first paragraph of this covenant, together with
the amount of any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof incurred pursuant to clause (10) of this
covenant, by Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors or the Issuer shall not exceed an amount equal to

Measurement Period (calculated on a pro forma basis);

(5) Existing Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness incurred under clause (1) or (2) above);

(6) Indebtedness consisting of Purchase Money Indebtedness in an aggregate amount (when aggregated with the
amount of Refinancing Indebtedness outstanding under clause (10) below in respect of Indebtedness incurred
pursuant to this clause (6)) not to exceed an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding equal to
the greater of (x) $25.0 million or (y) 30.0% of Consolidated EBITDA for the most recently ended
Measurement Period (calculated on a pro forma basis);

(7) Hedging Obligations of us or any of our Restricted Subsidiaries covering Indebtedness of us or such
Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that such Hedging Obligations are entered into for bona fide
hedging activities, including the issuance of convertible debt, and not for speculative purposes;

clause (11), (14), (15) or (20) below (“Refinancing Indebtedness”); provided, however, that:

(A) the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness shall not exceed the principal amount and
accrued interest of the Indebtedness so exchanged, extended, refinanced, renewed, replaced, substituted
or refunded and any premiums payable and reasonable fees, expenses, commissions and costs in
connection therewith;

(B) the Refinancing Indebtedness shall have a final maturity equal to or later than, and a Weighted Average

refunded; and

(D) if the Indebtedness to be exchanged, refinanced, renewed, replaced, substituted or refunded was the
obligation of the Issuer or Guarantor, such Refinancing Indebtedness shall not be incurred by any of our

the Indebtedness so refinanced;

(11) additional Indebtedness of the Issuer and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in an aggregate principal amount

subsequent to the Issue Date (together with the amount of any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof

extent such net cash proceeds or cash have been applied to make Restricted Payments;

second paragraph of the covenant described above under “— Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(25) non-voting Preferred Equity Interests of a Restricted Subsidiary issued to a Strategic Investor in the ordinary

2.00 to 1.00; and

(26) (a) Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Professional Services Affiliate incurred in

of letters of credit, banker’s acceptances or other similar instruments or obligations issued for the benefit of, or
relating to liabilities or obligations incurred on behalf of, a Professional Services Affiliate, incurred in the
ordinary course of business pursuant to or in connection with Management Services Agreement.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (a) the outstanding principal amount of any item of
Indebtedness shall be counted only once, and any obligation arising under any guarantee, Lien, letter of credit or
similar instrument supporting such Indebtedness incurred in compliance with this covenant shall be disregarded, and
(b) if an item of Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the categories described in clauses (1) through
(26) above or is permitted to be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant and also meets the criteria
of one or more of the categories described in clauses (1) through (26) above, we shall, in our sole discretion, classify
such item of Indebtedness in any manner that complies with this covenant and may from time to time reclassify such
item of Indebtedness in any manner in which such item could be incurred at the time of such reclassification;
_provided that Indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Agreement on the Issue Date (and any Indebtedness secured_
by a Lien that refinances such Indebtedness) shall be deemed to be outstanding under clause (2) above and may not
be reclassified.

Accrual of interest or dividends on Preferred Equity Interests, the accretion of original issue discount and the
payment of interest or dividends on Preferred Equity Interests in the form of additional Indebtedness or Preferred
Equity Interests of the same class will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of
determining compliance with this covenant. Any increase in the amount of Indebtedness solely by reason of
currency fluctuations will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of determining
compliance with this covenant. A change in IFRS that results in an obligation existing at the time of such change,
not previously classified as Indebtedness, becoming Indebtedness will not be deemed to be an incurrence of
Indebtedness for purposes of determining compliance with this covenant.

The amount of indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (1) the accreted value thereof, in the case of any
Indebtedness issued with original issue discount, (2) the principal amount thereof, in the case of any other
Indebtedness, (3) in the case of the guarantee by the specified Person of any Indebtedness of any other Person, the
maximum liability to which the specified Person may be subject upon the occurrence of the contingency giving rise
to the obligation and (4) in the case of Indebtedness of others guaranteed by means of a Lien on any asset of the
specified Person, the lesser of (A) the Fair Market Value of such asset on the date on which Indebtedness is required
to be determined pursuant to the indenture and (B) the amount of the Indebtedness so secured.


-----

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of
Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall
be calculated by us based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was
incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit Indebtedness; provided
that if such Indebtedness is incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such
refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-dominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant
currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar-dominated restriction shall be
deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed
the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant,
the maximum amount of Indebtedness that we may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be
exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any
Indebtedness incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, (1) if incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness
being refinanced, shall be calculated by us based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which
such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing and (2) shall be
deemed to be outstanding only when the proceeds thereof are not applied to effect such refinancing (and to pay any
fees, expenses, commissions and costs in connection therewith) substantially concurrently.

Notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness incurred to refinance
Indebtedness initially incurred in reliance on a clause of the second paragraph of this covenant measured by
reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA at the time of incurrence, if such refinancing would cause the
percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of
Consolidated EBITDA on the date of such refinancing, such percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction shall
not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the
principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus accrued and unpaid interest, dividends, premiums
(including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting discounts, fees, costs and expenses (including original
issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) in connection with such refinancing.

The Indenture will not treat unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness merely
because it is unsecured.

_Limitation on Asset Sales._

The indenture will provide that we will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly,
consummate any Asset Sale unless:

(1) we or such Restricted Subsidiary receives consideration at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair
Market Value (determined as of the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale) of the assets included in
such Asset Sale); and

(2) other than with respect to Permitted Asset Swaps, at least 75% of the total consideration in such Asset Sale
consists of cash or Cash Equivalents or Marketable Securities.

For purposes of clause (2), the following shall be deemed to be cash:

(a) the amount (without duplication) of any Indebtedness (other than Subordinated Indebtedness) of us or such
Restricted Subsidiary that is expressly assumed by the transferee in such Asset Sale and with respect to which
we or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is unconditionally released by the holder of such
Indebtedness,

(b) the amount of any obligations or securities received from such transferee that are within 180 days converted
by us or such Restricted Subsidiary to cash (to the extent of the cash actually so received),

(c) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset
Sale, to the extent that the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any Guarantee of
payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Sale, and

(d) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset
Sale having an aggregate Fair Market Value, taken together with all other Designated Non-cash Consideration
received pursuant to this clause (c), not to exceed the greater of $7.5 million and 10.0% of Consolidated
EBITDA for the most recently ended Measurement Period (calculated on a pro forma basis), with the Fair


-----

Market Value of each item of Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time received and
without giving effect to subsequent changes in value.

If we or any Restricted Subsidiary engages in an Asset Sale, we or such Restricted Subsidiary shall apply all or any
of the Net Proceeds therefrom to:

(1) at our election, either (x) repay First Lien Obligations (and in the case of any such repayment under any
revolving credit facility, effect a permanent reduction in the availability under such revolving credit facility)
or (y) repay, redeem or purchase the Notes; provided that if we repay First Lien Obligations (other than the
Notes) pursuant to clause (x), we will apply a pro rata amount to (i) equally and ratably reduce the Notes
Obligations in accordance with the procedures set forth under “—Optional redemption” and/or (ii) make an
Excess Proceeds Offer; or

(3) (A) invest all or any part of the Net Proceeds thereof in capital expenditures or the purchase of assets to be
used by us or any Restricted Subsidiary in a Permitted Business, (B) acquire Equity Interests in a Person that
is a Restricted Subsidiary or in a Person engaged primarily in a Permitted Business that shall become a
Restricted Subsidiary immediately upon the consummation of such acquisition or (C) a combination of (A)
and (B).

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this covenant, (i) to the extent that any of or all the Net Proceeds of any
Asset Sale received or deemed to be received by a Foreign Subsidiary (a “Foreign Disposition”) is (x) prohibited or
delayed by applicable local law or (y) restricted by applicable organizational documents in each case, from being
repatriated to Canada if the Issuer is organized under the laws of Canada or a political subdivision thereof or the
United States, if the Issuer is organized under the laws of the United States or any State thereof or the District of
Columbia, an amount equal to the portion of such Net Proceeds so affected will not be required to be applied in
compliance with this covenant so long, but only so long, as the applicable local law or organizational documents
will not permit repatriation to the United States or Canada, as applicable, (the Issuer hereby agreeing to use
reasonable efforts (as determined in the Issuer’s reasonable business judgment) to otherwise cause the applicable
Foreign Subsidiary to within one year following the date on which the respective payment would otherwise have
been required, promptly take all actions reasonably required by the applicable local law or applicable organizational
impediments to permit such repatriation), and if within one year following the date on which the respective payment
would otherwise have been required, such repatriation of any of such affected Net Proceeds is permitted under the
applicable local law or applicable organizational impediment, an amount equal to such Net Proceeds will be
promptly (and in any event not later than five Business Days after such repatriation could be made) applied (net of
additional Taxes payable or reserved against as a result thereof) (whether or not repatriation actually occurs) in
compliance with this covenant and (ii) to the extent that the Issuer has determined in good faith that repatriation of
any of or all the Net Proceeds of any Foreign Disposition would have an material adverse Tax consequence (which
for the avoidance of doubt, includes, but is not limited to, any prepayment out of such Net Proceeds whereby doing
so the Issuer, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective affiliates and/or equity owners would incur a Tax
liability, including a Tax dividend, deemed dividend pursuant to Code Section 956 or a withholding Tax), an amount
equal to the Net Proceeds so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant. The nonapplication of any prepayment amounts as a consequence of the foregoing provisions will not, for the avoidance of
doubt, constitute a Default or an Event of Default.

Any Net Proceeds from any Asset Sale that are not applied or invested (or committed pursuant to a written
agreement to be applied) as provided in the preceding paragraph within 365 days after the receipt thereof and, in the
case of any amount committed to a reinvestment, which are not actually so applied within 180 days following such
365 day period shall constitute “Excess Proceeds” and shall be applied pursuant to the succeeding paragraph.
Pending the final application of any such Net Proceeds, we or such Restricted Subsidiary may temporarily reduce
revolving indebtedness under a Credit Facility, if any, or otherwise invest such Net Proceeds in any manner not
prohibited by the indenture.

When the cumulative amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $20.0 million, we will be obligated to make an offer to all
holders of the Notes (an “Excess Proceeds Offer”) to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes that may be
purchased out of such Excess Proceeds at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount
thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest to the date fixed for the closing of such offer in accordance with
the procedures set forth in the indenture. To the extent we or a Restricted Subsidiary is required under the terms of
any First Lien Obligations, we shall also make an offer to the holders of such First Lien Obligations on a pro rata
basis with the holders of the Notes, with such proceeds. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and other First


-----

Lien Obligations surrendered by holders thereof exceeds the amount of such Excess Proceeds, the Trustee shall
select the Notes and other First Lien Obligations and to be purchased on a pro rata basis by lot, and, in the case of
global notes, in accordance with the procedures of the depositary. To the extent that the principal amount of Notes
tendered pursuant to an Excess Proceeds Offer is less than the amount of such Excess Proceeds, we may use any
remaining Excess Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the indenture. Upon completion of an Excess Proceeds
Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

We will be required to comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities
laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the
repurchase of the Notes required in the event of an Excess Proceeds Offer and will not be deemed to have violated
the “Excess Proceeds Offer” provisions of the indenture as a result thereof.

_Limitation on Liens._

The indenture will provide that we shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly,
create, incur or assume any Lien (each, an “Initial Lien”) on any asset now owned or hereafter acquired, or on any
income or profits therefrom or assign or convey any right to receive income therefrom, other than (i) Permitted
Liens and (ii) with respect to Liens on assets not constituting Collateral, any such Lien securing Indebtedness if the
Notes are secured equally and ratably thereby (or, if such Indebtedness secured by Liens on assets not constituting
Collateral is subordinated to the Notes, the Notes are secured on a priority basis with respect to such Indebtedness).

Any Lien created for the benefit of the Holders pursuant to clause (ii) the preceding sentence shall provide by its
terms that such Lien shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon the release and
discharge of the Initial Lien.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time of the
incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such
Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such
Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of original
issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of
original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a
result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of property securing Indebtedness.

_Additional Subsidiary Guarantees._

The indenture will provide that if any of the Issuer’s Restricted Subsidiaries (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
Professional Services Affiliates) that is not a Guarantor guarantees or becomes otherwise obligated under a Credit
Facility incurred under clause (2) of the second paragraph under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness” or
any Capital Markets Indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount greater than $30.0 million incurred pursuant to
the covenant described above under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness” then in each case such Restricted
Subsidiary shall (i) execute and deliver to the Trustee and Collateral Agent a supplemental indenture in form
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and the Collateral Agent pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary shall
unconditionally guarantee all of the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes and the indenture on the terms set forth in
the indenture, (ii) execute and deliver to the Trustee and Collateral Agent joinders or supplements, as applicable, to
the Collateral Documents and the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement (and, if applicable, any Junior Lien
Intercreditor Agreement), together with any other filings and agreements (subject to customary extension periods)
required by the Collateral Documents to create or perfect the security interests of the Collateral Agent for its benefit
and for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes in the Collateral of such Restricted Subsidiary and
(iii) deliver to the Trustee and the Collateral Agent an officers’ certificate and an opinion of counsel that such
supplemental indenture and joinders or supplements to the Collateral Documents and First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement (and, if applicable, any Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement) have been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by such Restricted Subsidiary and constitute legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations of such
Restricted Subsidiary. Thereafter, such Restricted Subsidiary shall be a Guarantor for all purposes of the indenture,
the Collateral Documents and the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement (and, if applicable, any Junior Lien
Intercreditor Agreement).


-----

_Limitation on Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries._

The indenture will provide that we shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly,
create or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction on the
ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(a) pay dividends or make any other distribution to us or any of our Restricted Subsidiaries on its Capital Stock or
with respect to any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits, or pay any Indebtedness owed
to us or any of our Restricted Subsidiaries;

(b) make loans or advances to us or any of our Restricted Subsidiaries; or

(c) transfer any of its properties or assets to us or any of our Restricted Subsidiaries; except for such
encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of:

(i) Existing Indebtedness and existing agreements as in effect on the Issue Date;

(ii) applicable law or regulation;

(iii) any instrument governing Acquired Debt and any other agreement or instrument of an acquired Person
or any of its Subsidiaries as in effect at the time of acquisition (except to the extent such Indebtedness or
other agreement or instrument was incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such
acquisition), which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets
of any Person, other than the Person, or the property or assets of the Person, so acquired or any of its
Subsidiaries;

(iv) by reason of customary nonassignment provisions in leases entered into in the ordinary course of
business;

(v) Refinancing Indebtedness (as defined in the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness”); provided that the restrictions contained in the agreements
governing such Refinancing Indebtedness are no more restrictive than those contained in the agreements
governing the Indebtedness being refinanced;

(vi) the indenture, the Notes and the Collateral Documents or by our other Indebtedness ranking pari passu
with the Notes; provided that except as set forth in clause (vii) below such restrictions are no more
restrictive taken as a whole than those imposed by the indenture, the Notes and the Collateral
Documents;

(vii) any Indebtedness; provided that the restrictions therein are not (i) materially more restrictive than the
agreements governing such Indebtedness as in effect on the Issue Date or (ii) will not affect the Issuer’s
ability to make principal or interest payments on the Notes (as determined by the Issuer in good faith);

(viii) customary non-assignment provisions in contracts, leases, sub-leases and licenses entered into in the
ordinary course of business;

(ix) any agreement for the sale or other disposition of a Restricted Subsidiary or any of its assets in
compliance with the terms of the indenture that restricts distributions by that Restricted Subsidiary
pending such sale or other disposition;

(x) provisions limiting the disposition or distribution of assets or property (including cash) in joint venture
agreements, asset sale agreements, sale-leaseback agreements, stock sale agreements and other similar
agreements (including agreements entered into in connection with a Restricted Investment), and
customary provisions in joint venture agreements and other similar agreements applicable to the Equity
Interests or Indebtedness of such joint venture, which limitation is applicable only to the assets that are
the subject of such agreements;

(xi) Liens not prohibited by the covenant described above under “—Limitation on Liens”;

(xii) any agreement for the sale of any Subsidiary or its assets that restricts distributions by that Subsidiary
(or sale of such Subsidiary’s Equity Interests) pending its sale; provided that during the entire period in
which such encumbrance or restriction is effective, such sale (together with any other sales pending)
would be permitted under the terms of the indenture;


-----

(xiii) secured Indebtedness otherwise permitted to be incurred by the indenture that limits the right of the
debtor to dispose of the assets securing such Indebtedness;

(xiv) Purchase Money Indebtedness that imposes restrictions of the type described in clause (c) above on the
property so acquired;

(xv) any amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings,
replacements or refinancings of the contracts, instruments or obligations referred to in clauses (i)
through (xiv) above; provided that such amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases,
supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings are, in our good faith judgment, not materially
more restrictive as a whole with respect to such encumbrances and restrictions than those prior to such
amendment, modification, restatement, renewal, increase, supplement, refunding, replacement or
refinancing;

(xvi) Indebtedness or other agreements including, without limitation, agreements described in clause (x) of
this paragraph, of any non-Guarantor Subsidiary which imposes restrictions solely on such nonGuarantor Subsidiary and its Subsidiaries; or

(xvii) any restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers, licensors or lessors or
required by insurance, surety or bonding companies, in each case under contracts entered into in the
ordinary course of business.

_Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets._

The indenture will provide that we shall not consolidate, amalgamate, participate in an arrangement with or merge
with or into (whether or not we are the surviving entity), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose
of all or substantially all of our properties or assets in one or more related transactions to, another Person unless:

(a) we are the surviving Person or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation, amalgamation,
arrangement or merger (if other than us) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or
other disposition shall have been made is a corporation, limited partnership or limited liability company
organized or existing under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or Canada or any political
subdivision thereof; provided, however, that if the surviving Person is a limited liability company or limited
partnership, such entity shall also form a co-issuer that is a corporation;

(b) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation, amalgamation, arrangement or merger (if other
than us) or the Person to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition shall
have been made assumes all our obligations under the Notes, the indenture, the Collateral Documents and the
First Lien Intercreditor Agreement (and, if applicable, any Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement) pursuant to a
supplemental indenture and joinders or supplements, as applicable, to the Collateral Documents and the First
Lien Intercreditor Agreement (and, if applicable, any Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement), in each case, in
form reasonably acceptable to the Trustee and the Collateral Agent;

(c) immediately after such transaction, no Event of Default exists; and

(d) we or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation, amalgamation, arrangement or merger (if
other than us) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition will have
been made: (i) will have Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio immediately after the transaction (but
prior to any purchase accounting adjustments or accrual of deferred tax liabilities resulting from the
transaction) not less than our Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio immediately preceding the
transaction or (ii) would, at the time of such transaction after giving pro forma effect thereto as if such
transaction had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, be permitted to incur at least
$1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph in the covenant described under “—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness.”

Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to the second succeeding paragraph, any Restricted Subsidiary may
consolidate, amalgamate with, participate in an arrangement with or merge into or transfer all or part of its
properties and assets to us or another Restricted Subsidiary.

Notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (c) and (d), we may merge or amalgamate with a Restricted Subsidiary solely
for the purpose of reorganizing ourselves in another jurisdiction of the United States or any State thereof or the


-----

District of Columbia or Canada or any political subdivision thereof so long as the amount of Indebtedness of us and
the Restricted Subsidiaries is not increased thereby.

The indenture will provide that each Guarantor (other than any Guarantor whose Guarantee is to be released in
accordance with the terms of such Guarantee and the indenture) will not, and we will not cause or permit any
Guarantor to, consolidate, amalgamate, participate in an arrangement with or merge with or into (whether or not
such Guarantor is the surviving entity) any Person other than us or a Guarantor (in each case, other than in
accordance with the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales”) unless:

(a) the Guarantor is the surviving Person or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation,
amalgamation, arrangement or merger (if other than the Guarantor) is a corporation, limited partnership or
limited liability company organized or existing under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the
District of Columbia;

(b) the Person formed by or surviving any such consideration, amalgamation or merger (if other than the
Guarantor) assumes all the obligations of the Guarantor under the indenture, the Notes, the Collateral
Documents and the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement (and, if applicable, any Junior Lien Intercreditor
Agreement) pursuant to a supplemental indenture and joinders or supplements, as applicable, to the Collateral
Documents and the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement (and, if applicable, any Junior Lien Intercreditor
Agreement), in each case, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and the Collateral Agent; and

(c) immediately after such transaction, no Event of Default exists.

This section includes a phrase relating to the sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposition of “all
or substantially all” of our properties or assets. Although there is a developing body of case law interpreting the
phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly,
if we dispose of less than all our properties or assets by any of the means described above, the application of the
covenant described in this section may be uncertain.

_Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates._

The indenture will provide that we shall not and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly,
sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of our or their properties or assets to, or purchase any property or
assets from, or enter into any contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or for the benefit
of, any Affiliate (including any Unrestricted Subsidiary and Minority Investment) in any one or a series of
transactions involving aggregate payments in excess of $5.0 million (or in the case of a Minority Investment, in
excess of $2.5 million) (each of the foregoing, an “Affiliate Transaction”), unless:

(a) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable transaction at the
time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such transaction in arm’s length
dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(b) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of $7.5 million and
10% of Consolidated EBITDA for the most recently ended measurement period calculated on a pro forma
basis), the terms of such transaction have been approved by a majority of the disinterested members of the
Board of Directors of the Issuer.

Any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in clause (b) of this paragraph
if such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the disinterested directors of the Issuer, if any.

_provided, however, that the following shall, in each case, not be deemed Affiliate Transactions:_

(i) the entry into employment agreements and the adoption of compensation or benefit plans for the benefit
of, or the payment of compensation to, directors and management of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries
(including, without limitation, salaries, fees, bonuses, equity and incentive arrangements and payments);

(ii) indemnification or similar arrangements for officers, directors, employees or agents of us or any of our
Restricted Subsidiaries pursuant to charter, bylaw, statutory or contractual provisions;

(iii) transactions between or among us and our Restricted Subsidiaries;


-----

(iv) Restricted Payments not prohibited by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation
on Restricted Payments” and Permitted Investments;

(v) any transactions between us or any of our Restricted Subsidiaries and any Affiliate of us the Equity
Interests of which Affiliate are owned solely by us or one of our Restricted Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and by Persons who are not Affiliates of us or Restricted Subsidiaries, on the other hand;

(vi) the payment of compensation, fees, costs and expenses to, and indemnities (including under insurance
policies) and reimbursements, employment and severance arrangements, and employee benefit and
pension expenses provided on behalf of, or for the benefit of, future, current or former employees,
directors, officers, managers, contractors, consultants, distributors or advisors of the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary (whether directly or indirectly);

(vii) any agreements or arrangements in effect on the Issue Date and described in this offering memorandum
and any modifications, extensions or renewals thereof that are not disadvantageous to the holders of
Notes in the Issuer’s reasonable determination in any material respect;

(viii) so long as they comply with clause (a) above, transactions with customers, clients, lessors, landlords,
suppliers, contractors, or purchasers or sellers of goods or services that are Affiliates, in each case in the
ordinary course of business and otherwise in compliance with the terms of the indenture;

(ix) transactions with Persons who are Affiliates of us solely as a result of our or a Restricted Subsidiary’s
Investment in such Person;

(x) sales of Equity Interests to Affiliates of the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries not otherwise prohibited
by the indenture and the granting of registration and other customary rights in connection therewith;

(xi) transactions with an Affiliate where the only consideration paid is Equity Interests of the Issuer other
than Disqualified Stock;

(xii) transactions in which the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, deliver to the
Trustee a letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is fair to the Issuer
or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or meets the requirements of this covenant;

(xiii) transactions with joint ventures or Unrestricted Subsidiaries entered into in the ordinary course of
business;

(xiv) transactions between the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries and any Person, a director of which
is also a director of the Issuer; provided, however, that such director abstains from voting as a director
on any matter involving such other Person;

(xv) any transition services arrangement, supply arrangement or similar arrangement entered into in
connection with or in contemplation of the disposition of assets or Capital Stock in any Restricted
Subsidiary permitted under “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock.” or entered into
with any Business Successor, in each case, that the Issuer determines in good faith is either fair to the
Issuer or otherwise on customary terms for such type of arrangements in connection with similar
transactions;

(xvi) transactions entered into by an Unrestricted Subsidiary with an Affiliate prior to the day such
Unrestricted Subsidiary is redesignated as a Restricted Subsidiary (and not entered into in contemplation
of such redesignation) as described under “—Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries”
and pledges of Capital Stock of Unrestricted Subsidiaries;

(xvii) (i) any lease entered into between the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, as lessee, and any Affiliate of
the Issuer, as lessor and (ii) any operational services arrangement entered into between the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Issuer, in each case, which is approved as being no worse
than a transaction on an arm’s length basis by the reasonable determination of the Issuer; and

(xviii) intellectual property licenses and research and development agreements in the ordinary course of
business or consistent with past practice.


-----

_Reports._

So long as the notes are outstanding, the indenture will provide that the Issuer will furnish to the holders of the
Notes and the Trustee:

(1) (x) all annual and quarterly financial statements substantially in forms that would be required to be contained in a
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on Forms 10-K and 10-Q (or successor forms) of the
Issuer, if the Issuer were required to file such forms, plus a “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” and (y) with respect to the annual financial statements only, a report on the
annual financial statements by the Issuer’s independent registered public accounting firm; and

(2) within 10 Business Days after the occurrence of an event required to be therein reported, such other information
containing substantially the same information that would be required to be contained in filings with the SEC on
Form 8-K under Items 1.01, 1.02, 1.03, 2.01 (which, with respect to acquisitions, shall be only with respect to
acquisitions that are “significant” pursuant to clauses (1) and (2) of the definition of “Significant Subsidiary” under
Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X), 2.05, 2.06, 4.01, 4.02, 5.01 and 5.02(b) (only with respect to the principal executive
officer, president, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer and principal operating officer) and (c)
(other than with respect to information otherwise required or contemplated by Item 402 of Regulation S-K
promulgated by the SEC) as in effect on the Issue Date if the Issuer were required to file such reports; provided,
however, that no such current report will be required to include as an exhibit, or to include a summary of the terms
of, any employment or compensatory arrangement agreement, plan or understanding between the Issuer (or any of
its Subsidiaries) and any director, manager or executive officer, of the Issuer (or any of its Subsidiaries); provided,
however, that (i) in no event shall such information or reports be required to comply with Rule 3-10 of Regulation SX promulgated by the SEC or contain separate consolidating financial information with respect to, or separate
financial statements or information for, the Issuer, the Guarantors, other Subsidiaries the shares of which are pledged
to secure the Notes or any Guarantee, any Related Corporation or any other affiliate of the Issuer that would be
required under (a) Section 3-09 of Regulation S-X, (b) Section 3-10 of Regulation S-X or (c) Section 3-16 of
Regulation S-X, respectively, promulgated by the SEC, (ii) in no event shall such information or reports be required
to comply with Regulation G under the Exchange Act or Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC with
respect to any non-GAAP financial measures contained therein, (iii) no such information or reports referenced under
clause (2) above shall be required to be furnished if the Issuer determines in its good faith judgment that such event
is not material to the holders of the notes or the business, assets, operations or financial position of the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iv) in no event shall such information or reports be required to include
any information that is not otherwise similar to information currently included in the Offering Memorandum, other
than with respect to information or reports provided under clause (2) above, and (v) in no event shall information or
reports referenced in clause (2) above be required to include as an exhibit copies of any agreements, financial
statements or other items that would be required to be filed as exhibits to a current report on Form 8-K except for (x)
agreements evidencing material Indebtedness and (y) historical and pro forma financial statements to the extent
reasonably available.

All such annual information and reports shall be furnished within 90 days after the end of the fiscal year to which
they relate, and all such quarterly information and reports shall be furnished within 45 days after the end of the fiscal
quarter to which they relate and in each case subject to any extension, tolling or other relief that would be available
to the Issuer under applicable United States or Canadian securities laws and regulations at such time.

Except as provided in the last paragraph of this section, the Issuer will make available such information and reports
(as well as the details regarding the conference call described below) to any holder of notes and, upon request, to
any beneficial owner of the notes, in each case by posting such information and reports on its website, on Intralinks
or any comparable password-protected online data system which will require a confidentiality acknowledgment, and
will make such information and reports readily available to any holder of notes, any bona fide prospective investor
in the notes (which prospective investors shall be limited to “qualified institutional buyers” within the meaning of
Rule 144A of the Securities Act or non-U.S. persons that certify their status as such to the reasonable satisfaction of
the Issuer), any securities analyst (to the extent providing analysis of investment in the notes) or any market maker
in the notes who agrees to treat such information and reports as confidential or accesses such information and
reports on Intralinks or any comparable password-protected online data system which will require a confidentiality
acknowledgment; provided that the Issuer shall post such information and reports thereon and make readily


-----

available any password or other login information to any such holder of notes, bona fide prospective investor,
securities analyst or market maker.

The Issuer will hold a quarterly conference call for all holders of notes and securities analysts (to the extent
providing analysis of investment in the notes) to discuss such financial information (including a customary Q&A
session) no later than ten (10) Business Days after distribution of such financial information (which obligation, for
the avoidance of doubt, shall be satisfied by the Issuer’s regular earnings calls).

In addition, to the extent not satisfied by the foregoing, the Issuer shall furnish to holders of the notes any
prospective investors, upon their request, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4)
under the Securities Act so long as the notes remain outstanding.

Notwithstanding anything else herein, the Issuer will be deemed to have furnished the financial statements and other
information referred to in clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant if the Issuer has filed reports on
the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (“SEDAR”) or any successor system or with the SEC
via the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval (“EDGAR”) filing system or any successor system
thereto; provided that if the Issuer has filed such reports on SEDAR or EDGAR, in order to comply with clauses (1)
and (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer need only file such reports as would be required of it
pursuant to applicable Canadian and United States laws that apply to the Issuer’s public reporting requirements at
such time and nothing more.

**Financial Calculations for Limited Condition Transactions and Compliance Calculations**

When calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the indenture, in each case in connection with a
Limited Condition Transaction and other transactions in connection therewith (including any incurrence or issuance
of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Equity Interests and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence of
any Lien or the making of any Investment or any Restricted Payments), the date of determination of such basket or
ratio and of any Default or Event of Default may, at our option, be the date the definitive agreement(s) for such
Limited Condition Transaction is entered into. Any such ratio or basket shall be calculated on a pro forma basis after
giving effect to such Limited Condition Transaction and other transactions in connection therewith (including any
incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Equity Interests and the use of proceeds
thereof, the incurrence of any Lien or the making of any Investment or any Restricted Payments) as if they had been
consummated at the beginning of the applicable period for purposes of determining the ability to consummate any
such Limited Condition Transaction; provided that if we elect to make such determination as of the date of such
definitive agreement(s), then (x) we shall be deemed to be in compliance with such ratios or baskets solely for
purposes of determining whether the Limited Condition Transaction and other transactions in connection therewith
(including any incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Equity Interests and the use
of proceeds thereof, the incurrence of any Lien or the making of any Investment or any Restricted Payments), is
permitted under the applicable covenants, and (y) such ratios or baskets shall not be tested at the time of
consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction or related transactions; provided, further, that if we elect to
have such determinations occur at the time of entry into such definitive agreement(s), any such transactions
(including any incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock and the use of proceeds
thereof, the incurrence of any Lien or the making of any Investment or any Restricted Payments) shall be deemed to
have occurred on the date the definitive agreement(s) is entered into and shall be deemed outstanding thereafter for
purposes of calculating any ratios or baskets under the indenture after the date of such definitive agreement(s) and
before the consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction, unless such definitive agreement(s) is terminated
or such Limited Condition Transaction or incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Equity Interests, Restricted Payment, Investment or incurrence of Liens or such other transaction to which pro forma
effect is being given does not occur.

For purposes of calculating any ratio-based basket, with respect to any revolving Indebtedness incurred under such
ratio-based basket, the Issuer may elect (which election may not be changed with respect to such Indebtedness), at
any time, to either (x) give pro forma effect to the incurrence of the entire committed amount of such Indebtedness,
in which case such committed amount may thereafter be borrowed or reborrowed, in whole or in part, from time to
time, without further compliance with any ratio-based component of any provision of the Indenture, or (y) give pro
_forma effect to the incurrence of the actual amount drawn under such revolving Indebtedness, in which case, the_
ability to incur the amounts committed to under such Indebtedness will be subject to such ratio-based basket (to the


-----

extent being incurred pursuant to such ratio) at the time of each such Incurrence. To the extent clause (x) of the
immediately preceding sentence is elected, such revolving Indebtedness shall be deemed to be incurred (and the
fully committed amount of Indebtedness as outstanding) at all times thereafter for purposes of testing any ratiobased baskets, regardless of whether such Indebtedness is outstanding, until such commitments have been
permanently terminated in full.

Notwithstanding anything herein the contrary, unless the Issuer elects otherwise, if, on any date, the Issuer or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with any transaction or series of related transactions (A) utilizes a ratiobased basket under a covenant and (B) utilizes a non-ratio-based basket under the same covenant, then the
applicable ratio-based basket under such covenant will be calculated on such date with respect to any usage under
the applicable ratio-based basket under such covenant without giving effect to the usage under such non-ratio based
basket under the same such covenant made in connection with such transaction or series of related transactions.

**Suspension of Covenants**

During any period of time after the Issue Date that (i) the Notes are rated Investment Grade by both Rating Agencies
and (ii) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the indenture (the occurrence of the
events described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being collectively referred to as a “Covenant Suspension
Event”), the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the covenants in the indenture specifically
listed under the following captions in this “Description of Notes” section of this offering memorandum (the
“Suspended Covenants”):

(1) “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(2) “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness”;

(3) “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales”;

(4) clause (d) of the first paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets”;

(5) “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates”;

(6) “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted
Subsidiaries;” and

(7) “—Certain Covenants—Additional Subsidiary Guarantees.”

Additionally, at such time as the above referenced covenants are suspended (a “Suspension Period”), we will no
longer be permitted to designate any Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary.

In the event that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants for any period
of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent date (the “Reversion Date”) one or both of the Rating
Agencies withdraw their Investment Grade rating or downgrade the rating assigned to the Notes below Investment
Grade, then the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants
with respect to future events.

On each Reversion Date, all Indebtedness incurred during the Suspension Period prior to such Reversion Date will
be deemed to be Existing Indebtedness. For purposes of calculating the amount available to be made as Restricted
Payments under clause (iii) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Restricted Payments,” calculations under such covenant shall be made as though such covenant had
been in effect during the entire period of time after the Issue Date (including the Suspension Period) Restricted
Payments made during the Suspension Period not otherwise permitted pursuant to any of clauses (2) through (13)
under the second paragraph under the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted
Payments” will reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under clause (iii) of the first
paragraph of such covenant, provided that the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments on the Reversion
Date shall not be reduced to below zero solely as a result of such Restricted Payments. For purposes of the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales,” on the Reversion Date, the unutilized amount
of Net Proceeds will be reset to zero. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither (a) the continued existence, after the
Reversion Date, of facts and circumstances or obligations that were incurred or otherwise came into existence during
a Suspension Period nor (b) the performance of any such obligations, shall constitute a breach of any covenant set
forth herein or cause a Default or Event of Default thereunder; provided that (1) the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries did not incur or otherwise cause such facts and circumstances or obligations to exist in anticipation of a


-----

withdrawal or downgrade by the applicable Rating Agency below an Investment Grade rating and (2) the Issuer
reasonably believed that such incurrence or actions would not result in such withdrawal or downgrade. On each
Reversion Date, the Issuer shall be required to comply with the provisions under the covenant entitled “—Certain
covenants—Additional Subsidiary Guarantees” as if such covenant was in effect at all times during the Suspension
Period.

The Issuer shall provide an officers’ certificate to the Trustee indicating the occurrence of any Covenant Suspension
Event, Suspension Period or Reversion Date. The Trustee shall have no obligation to monitor the ratings of the
Notes, independently determine or verify if such events have occurred or notify the holders of Notes of any
Covenant Suspension Event, Suspension Period or Reversion Date. The Trustee may provide a copy of such
officers’ certificate to any holder of Notes upon request.

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade ratings.

**Events of Default**

The indenture will provide that each of the following constitutes an “Event of Default”:

(a) default for 30 days in the payment when due of interest or additional interest, if any, on the Notes;

(b) default in payment when due of principal of or premium, if any, on the Notes at maturity, upon repurchase,
redemption or otherwise;

(c) failure to comply for 30 days after notice with any obligations under the provisions described under “—
Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets,” “—Change of Control” or “—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales” (other than a failure to purchase Notes duly tendered to the Issuer for
repurchase pursuant to a Change of Control Offer or an Excess Proceeds Offer);

(d) subject to the penultimate paragraph of this “Events of default” section, default under any other provision of
the indenture, the Notes or the Collateral Documents, which default remains uncured for 60 days after notice
from the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% of the aggregate principal amount then outstanding of the
Notes;

(e) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may
be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed (or commitments in respect of Indebtedness
for borrowed money) by us and any of our Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is guaranteed by
us and any of our Restricted Subsidiaries), which default is caused by a failure to pay the principal of such
Indebtedness at the final stated maturity thereof within the grace period provided in such Indebtedness (a
“Payment Default”), and the principal amount of any such Indebtedness (including the principal amount of
commitments in respect of such Indebtedness), together with the principal amount of any other such
Indebtedness (including the principal amount of commitments in respect of such Indebtedness) under which
there has been a Payment Default, aggregates $25.0 million or more;

(f) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may
be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed (or commitments in respect of Indebtedness
for borrowed money) by us and any of our Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is guaranteed by
us or any of our Restricted Subsidiaries), which default results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness (or
termination of related commitments) prior to its express maturity not rescinded or cured within 30 days after
such acceleration (or termination of related commitments), and the principal amount of any such Indebtedness
(including the principal amount of commitments in respect of such Indebtedness), together with the principal
amount of any other such Indebtedness (including the principal amount of commitments in respect of such
Indebtedness) under which there has been a Payment Default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated
(or commitments terminated) and remains undischarged after such 30 day period, aggregates $25.0 million or
more;

(g) failure by us and any of our Restricted Subsidiaries to pay final judgments (other than any judgment as to
which a reputable insurance company has accepted full liability) aggregating $25.0 million or more, which
judgments are not stayed within 60 days after their entry;

(h) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (or a group
of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together, as of the last Measurement Period, would constitute a


-----

Significant Subsidiary) of the Issuer (including the filing of a voluntary case, the consent to an order of relief
in an involuntary case, the consent to the appointment of a custodian, receiver or interim receiver, a general
assignment for the benefit of creditors or an order of a court for relief in an involuntary case, appointing a
custodian, trustee, receiver or interim receiver or ordering liquidation, which order remains unstayed for 60
days);

(i) any Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary (or a group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together, as of the
last Measurement Period, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) shall be held in a judicial proceeding to
be unenforceable or invalid or shall cease for any reason to be in full force and effect, or any Guarantor that
qualifies as a Significant Subsidiary (or a group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together, as of the last
Measurement Period, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary), or any Person acting on behalf of any
Guarantor that qualifies as a Significant Subsidiary (or a group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together,
as of the last Measurement Period, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary), shall deny or disaffirm its
obligations under its Guarantee; and

(j) any Collateral Document after delivery thereof shall for any reason cease (or shall be asserted in writing by
the Issuer or any Guarantor to cease) to create a valid and perfected first priority Lien to the extent required by
the Collateral Documents (subject to no other Liens other than Permitted Liens) on Collateral that is (i)
purported to be covered thereby and (ii) comprises Property which, when taken together with all Property as to
which such a Lien has so ceased to be effective, has a fair market value in excess of $25.0 million (other than
(x) in accordance with the terms of the Indenture or the terms of the Credit Facilities or the Security
Documents or (y) except to the extent that any such cessation of the Liens results from the failure of the
administrative agent under the Credit Facilities or the Applicable Authorized Representative, as the case may
be, in each case, as bailee for the Collateral Agent pursuant to the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agent,
to maintain possession of certificates actually delivered to it representing securities pledged under the Security
Documents).

If any Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee, by notice to the Issuer, or the holders of at least 25%
of the aggregate principal amount then outstanding of the Notes, by notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may declare
all the Notes to be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default
arising from the events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Issuer described in clause (h) above, all
outstanding Notes will become due and payable without further action or notice. Holders of the Notes may not
enforce the indenture or the Notes except as provided in the indenture. Subject to certain limitations, holders of a
majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or
power. The Trustee may withhold from holders of the Notes notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default
(except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of principal or interest) if it determines that
withholding notice is in such holders’ interest.

Subject to certain conditions, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount then outstanding of the Notes,
by notice to the Trustee, may on behalf of the holders of all of the Notes waive any existing Default or Event of
Default and its consequences under the indenture, except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of
interest or premium on, or principal of, the Notes.

However, a Default under clause (c), (d) or (g) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the
Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the Issuer of the Default
and, with respect to clauses (c) and (g), the Issuer does not cure such Default within the time specified in clause (c)
or (g) of this paragraph after the occurrence of such Default; provided that a notice of Default may not be given with
respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to holders, more than two years prior to such notice of Default.

Any failure to perform, or breach of, any covenant or agreement pursuant to “—Certain Covenants—Reports” shall
not be a Default or an Event of Default until the 121st day after we have received the notice referred to in clause (d)
of the first paragraph above (at which point, unless cured or waived, such failure to perform or breach shall
constitute an Event of Default). A failure to perform, or breach of any covenant or agreement pursuant to “—Certain
Covenants—Reports” shall automatically cease to be outstanding and shall be deemed cured at such time as we
furnish or file the applicable information or report.

We will be required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the indenture.


-----

**No personal liability of directors, owners, employees, incorporators and stockholders**

No director, owner, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of us or any of our Affiliates, as such, shall have
any liability for any obligations of us or any of our Affiliates under the Notes, the Guarantees, the indenture, the
First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, any Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement, if applicable, or any Collateral
Document or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each holder of
Notes by accepting a note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration
for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws and
it is the view of the Commission that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

The indenture will provide that with respect to the Notes, we may, at our option and at any time, elect to have all
obligations discharged with respect to the outstanding Notes, have each Guarantor’s obligation discharged with
respect to its Guarantee and have the Liens securing the outstanding Notes under the Collateral automatically
terminated and released (“Legal Defeasance”). Such Legal Defeasance means that we will be deemed to have paid
and discharged the entire indebtedness, and satisfied all obligations and covenants under the indenture, except for:

(a) the rights of holders of outstanding Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if any,
and interest on the Notes when such payments are due, or on the redemption date, as the case may be;

(b) our obligations with respect to the Notes concerning issuing temporary Notes, registration of Notes, mutilated,
destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security
payments held in trust;

(c) the rights, powers, trust, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and our obligations in connection therewith;
and

(d) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the indenture.

In addition, the indenture will provide that with respect to the Notes, we may, at our option and at any time, elect to
have all obligations released with respect to substantially all of the restrictive covenants that are described in the
indenture, including, without limitation, under “—Change of control” and have the Liens securing the outstanding
Notes automatically terminated and released (“Covenant Defeasance”) and thereafter any omission to comply with
such obligations shall not constitute a Default or Event of Default with respect to the Notes. If Covenant Defeasance
occurs, certain events (not including nonpayment, bankruptcy, receivership, rehabilitation and insolvency events)
described under “—Events of default” will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Notes.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance, the indenture will provide that with respect to
the Notes:

(i) we must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the holders of the Notes, cash in U.S.
dollars, non-callable U.S. government obligations, or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be
sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants, to pay the
principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the outstanding Notes on the stated maturity or on the applicable
optional redemption date, as the case may be;

(ii) in the case of Legal Defeasance, we shall have delivered to the Trustee an opinion of counsel in the United
States confirming that:

(A) we have received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling or

(B) since the Issue Date, there has been a change in the applicable federal income tax law,

in each case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion of counsel shall confirm that, the beneficial
owners of the Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of
such Legal Defeasance, and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax in the same amount, in the same manner
and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(iii) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, we shall have delivered to the Trustee an opinion of counsel confirming
that the beneficial owners of the Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax
purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same


-----

amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance
had not occurred;

(iv) in the case of Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance, we shall have delivered to the Trustee an opinion of
counsel or an advance tax ruling from the Canada Revenue Agency (or successor agency), in each case to the
effect that the holders and beneficial owners of the Notes will not recognize income, gain, or loss for Canadian
federal, provincial or territorial income or other tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance or Covenant
Defeasance, as the case may be, and will be subject to Canadian federal, provincial or territorial income or
other tax on the same amounts, in the same manner, and at the same times as would have been the case if such
Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance, as the case may be, had not occurred;

(v) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit;

(vi) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a
default under, the indenture or any other material agreement or instrument to which we or any of our
Subsidiaries is a party or by which we or any of our Subsidiaries is bound;

(vii) we shall have delivered to the Trustee an officers’ certificate stating that the deposit was not made by us with
the intent of preferring the holders of the Notes over any of our other creditors or with the intent of defeating,
hindering, delaying or defrauding any of its other creditors or others; and

(viii) we shall have delivered to the Trustee an officers’ certificate and opinion of counsel stating that all conditions
precedent provided for or relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance relating to the Notes
have been complied with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The indenture, the Notes and the Collateral Documents will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect
(except as to surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of the Notes and the rights, powers, trust, duties
and immunities of the Trustee and the Collateral Agent, and our obligations in connection therewith, as expressly
provided for in the indenture) as to all outstanding Notes, and the Liens securing the Notes then outstanding will be
released, when:

(1) either:

(a) all the Notes, theretofore authenticated and delivered (except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes which have
been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust or
segregated and held in trust by the Issuer and thereafter repaid to the Issuer or discharged from such
trust) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or

(b) all Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and payable or,
within one year will become due and payable or subject to redemption as set forth above under the
heading “—Optional Redemption” and the Issuer has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited
with the Trustee funds in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Notes
not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal of, premium, if any, and interest
on the Notes to the date of deposit together with irrevocable instructions from the Issuer directing the
Trustee to apply such funds to the payment thereof at maturity or redemption, as the case may be;

(2) the Issuer has paid all other sums payable under the indenture by the Issuer; and

(3) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an officers’ certificate and an opinion of counsel stating that all
conditions precedent under the indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the indenture have been
complied with; provided, however, that such counsel may rely, as to matters of fact, on a certificate or
certificates of officers of the Issuer.

**Amendment, Supplement and Waiver**

Except as provided in the next paragraph, the indenture, the Notes, the Guarantees, the Collateral Documents, the
First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and any Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement may be amended or supplemented
with the written consent of the holders of at least a majority of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then
outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with an exchange offer or tender offer for the Notes), and
any existing Default and its consequences or compliance with any provision of the indenture, the Notes, any


-----

Collateral Document, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement or any Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement may be
waived with the consent of the holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding
(including consents obtained in connection with an exchange offer or tender offer for the Notes).

Without the consent of each holder affected, however, an amendment or waiver may not (with respect to any Note
held by a non-consenting holder):

(a) reduce the aggregate principal amount of Notes whose holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or
waiver;

(b) reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any note or alter the provisions with respect to the
redemption of the Notes (other than as provided in clause (h) below);

(c) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any Notes;

(d) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the Notes
(except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);

(e) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Notes;

(f) make any change in the provisions of the indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or the rights of holders
of Notes to receive payments of principal of or interest on the Notes;

(g) waive a redemption payment or mandatory redemption with respect to any Note (other than as provided in

(h) amend, change or modify in any material respect the obligation of the Issuer to make and consummate a
Change of Control Offer in the event of a Change of Control after such Change of Control has occurred;

(i) release all or substantially all of the Guarantees of the Guarantors other than in accordance with “—
Guarantees” above;

(j) make any change in the foregoing amendment and waiver provisions;

(k) impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to the Notes or the
Guarantees; or

(l) subordinate the payment of the Notes or Guarantees to any other obligation of the Issuers or the Guarantors.

Without the consent of holders of at least 66 2/3% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, no
amendment or waiver may (i) release all or substantially all of the Collateral from the Liens securing the Notes
Obligations created by the Collateral Documents, (ii) change or alter the priority of the Liens securing the Notes
Obligations created by the Collateral Documents in any manner adverse to the holders of the Notes or (iii) make any
change in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement or in the provisions of the
Indenture or any Collateral Document dealing with the application of proceeds of the Collateral that would
materially adversely affect the Holders or alter the priority of the security interests in the Collateral.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any holder of Notes, the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee
and the Collateral Agent may amend or supplement the indenture, the Notes or the Guarantees, or enter into, amend
or supplement any Collateral Document, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement or any Junior Lien Intercreditor
Agreement (i) to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency (as determined by the Issuer in good faith), (ii) to
provide for uncertificated Notes or Guarantees in addition to or in place of certificated Notes or Guarantees
(provided that the uncertificated notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code, or in
a manner such that the uncertificated notes are described in Section 163(f)(2)(B) of the Code), (iii) to provide for the
assumption of the obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor to holders of the Notes in the case of a merger,
amalgamation, arrangement, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets or such Guarantor’s assets
in accordance with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets”,
(iv) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the holders of Notes or that does not
adversely affect the rights under the indenture of any such holder in any material respect, (v) to provide for the
issuance of additional Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth in the indenture, (vi) to evidence and
provide for the acceptance of an appointment of a successor trustee or successor collateral agent, (vii) to comply
with the rules of any applicable securities, depository, (viii) to add Guarantees with respect to the Notes, (ix) to add


-----

Collateral with respect to the Notes and the Guarantees, (x) to conform the indenture, the Notes, the Guarantees, the
Collateral Documents and the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement to this “Description of notes,” (xi) to release
Collateral from the Liens securing the Notes and the Guarantees when permitted or required by the Collateral
Documents, the indenture, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement or any Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement, (xii)
to enter into any intercreditor agreement having substantially similar terms with respect to the holders of the Notes
as those set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, or any joinder thereto, or to enter into any Junior Lien
Intercreditor Agreement in connection with the incurrence of any Future First Lien Obligations or Junior Lien
Obligations not otherwise prohibited by the indenture or (xiii) with respect to the Collateral Documents and the First
Lien Intercreditor Agreement, as provided in the relevant Collateral Document or First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement.

Our obligations in respect of Change of Control Offer can be modified with the consent of the holders of a majority
in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding at any time prior to the occurrence of a Change of
Control. The consent of the noteholders is not necessary under the indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment.

**Divisions**

For all purposes under this “Description of Notes”, the indenture, the Collateral Documents and the First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement, in connection with any division or plan of division under Delaware law (or any comparable
event under a different jurisdiction’s laws): (a) if any asset, right, obligation or liability of any Person becomes the
asset, right, obligation or liability of a different Person, then it shall be deemed to have been transferred from the
original Person to the subsequent Person and (b) if any new Person comes into existence, such new Person shall be
deemed to have been organized on the first date of its existence by the holder of its Equity Interests at such time.

**Concerning the Trustee and the Collateral Agent**

The indenture will contain certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee and the Collateral Agent, if the Trustee or
the Collateral Agent becomes a creditor of us or our Subsidiaries, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to
realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee and the
Collateral Agent will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the Issuer and its Subsidiaries; provided,
however, if the Trustee or the Collateral Agent acquires any conflicting interest, it must eliminate such conflict
within 90 days, apply to the Commission for permission to continue as Trustee or Collateral Agent or resign.

With respect to the Notes, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes will have the
right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the
Trustee or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, subject to certain exceptions. The indenture will provide that in case
an Event of Default shall occur (which has not been cured), the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power,
to use the degree of care of a prudent person in the conduct of his or her own affairs. Subject to such provisions,
neither the Trustee nor the Collateral Agent will be relieved from liabilities for its own negligent action, its own
negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct, except that:

(i) this sentence shall not limit the preceding sentence of this paragraph;

(ii) it shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith, unless it is proved that it was negligent in
ascertaining the pertinent facts; and

(iii) it shall not be liable with respect to any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in accordance with a
direction received by it pursuant to the first sentence of this paragraph.

Subject to such provisions, neither the Trustee nor the Collateral Agent will be under any obligation to exercise any
of its rights or powers under the indenture at the request of any holder of Notes, unless such holder shall have
offered to the Trustee or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, security and indemnity satisfactory to each of them
against any loss, liability or expense.

**BOOK ENTRY, SETTLEMENT AND CLEARANCE**

**The Global Notes**

The notes will be issued in the form of several registered notes in global form, without interest coupons, as follows:

    - notes sold to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A will be represented by the Rule 144A
global note; and

    - notes sold in offshore transactions to non-U.S. Persons in reliance on Regulation S will be represented
by the Regulation S global note.

The Regulation S global notes together with the Rule 144A global notes are referred to as the global notes.

Upon issuance, each of the global notes will be deposited with the Trustee as custodian for The Depository Trust
Company, or DTC, and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC.

Ownership of beneficial interests in each global note will be limited to persons who have accounts with DTC, which
are called DTC participants, or persons who hold interests through DTC participants.

We expect that under procedures established by DTC:

    - upon deposit of each global note with DTC’s custodian, DTC will credit portions of the principal
amount of the global note to the accounts of the DTC participants designated by the initial purchasers;
and

    - ownership of beneficial interests in each global note will be shown on, and transfer of ownership of
those interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to interests of
DTC participants) and the records of DTC participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial
interests in the global note).

Beneficial interests in the global notes may not be exchanged for notes in physical, certificated form except in the
limited circumstances described below. Each global note and beneficial interests in each global note will be subject
to restrictions on transfer as described under “Important Information for Investors.”

**Exchanges among the Global Notes**

The distribution compliance period under Regulation S of the Securities Act will begin on the closing date and end
40 days after the closing date.

Beneficial interests in one global note may generally be exchanged for interests in another global note if in a
transaction in compliance with the securities laws applicable to such global note. Depending on whether the transfer
is being made during or after the distribution compliance period, and to which global note the transfer is being made,
the Trustee may require the seller to provide certain written certifications in the form provided in the indenture.

A beneficial interest in a global note that is transferred to a person who takes delivery through another global note
will, upon transfer, become subject to any transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial interests
in the other global note.

**Book-entry Procedures or the Global Notes**

All interests in the global notes will be subject to the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear Bank S.A/ N.V.
and Clearstream Banking S.A.. We provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for
the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that
settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither we nor the initial purchasers are responsible for those
operations or procedures.


-----

DTC has advised us that it is:

    - a limited purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York;

    - a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York State Banking Law;

    - a member of the Federal Reserve System;

    - a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code; and

    - a “clearing agency” registered under Section 17A of the Exchange Act.

DTC was created to hold securities for its participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities
transactions between its participants through electronic book-entry changes to the accounts of its participants.
DTC’s participants include securities brokers and dealers, including the initial purchasers; banks and trust
companies; clearing corporations and other organizations. Indirect access to DTC’s system is also available to
others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies; these indirect participants clear through or maintain a
custodial relationship with a DTC participant, either directly or indirectly. Investors who are not DTC participants
may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through DTC participants or indirect participants
in DTC.

So long as DTC’s nominee is the registered owner of a global note, that nominee will be considered the sole owner
or holder of the notes represented by that global note for all purposes under the indenture. Except as provided
below, owners of beneficial interests in a global note:

    - will not be entitled to have notes represented by the global note registered in their names;

    - will not receive or be entitled to receive physical, certificated notes; and

    - will not be considered the owners or holders of the notes under the indenture for any purpose,
including with respect to the giving of any direction, instruction or approval to the Trustee under the
indenture.

As a result, each investor who owns a beneficial interest in a global note must rely on the procedures of DTC to
exercise any rights of a holder of notes under the indenture (and, if the investor is not a participant or an indirect
participant in DTC, on the procedures of the DTC participant through which the investor owns its interest).

Payments of principal, premium (if any) and interest with respect to the notes represented by a global note will be
made by the Trustee or the paying agent to DTC’s nominee as the registered holder of the global note. Neither we
nor the Trustee nor any paying agent will have any responsibility or liability for the payment of amounts to owners
of beneficial interests in a global note, for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of
those interests by DTC, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records of DTC relating to those interests.

Payments by participants and indirect participants in DTC to the owners of beneficial interests in a global note will
be governed by standing instructions and customary industry practice and will be the responsibility of those
participants or indirect participants and DTC.

Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected under DTC’s procedures and will be settled in same-day
funds. Transfers between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way under the
rules and operating procedures of those systems.

Cross-market transfers between DTC participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on
the other hand, will be effected within DTC through the DTC participants that are acting as depositaries for
Euroclear and Clearstream. To deliver or receive an interest in a global note held in a Euroclear or Clearstream
account, an investor must send transfer instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, under the rules
and procedures of that system and within the established deadlines of that system. If the transaction meets its
settlement requirements, Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will send instructions to its DTC depositary


-----

to take action to effect final settlement by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant global notes in DTC, and
making or receiving payment under normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear
and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the DTC depositaries that are acting for
Euroclear or Clearstream.

Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant that purchases an
interest in a global note from a DTC participant will be credited on the business day for Euroclear or Clearstream
immediately following the DTC settlement date. Cash received in Euroclear or Clearstream from the sale of an
interest in a global note to a DTC participant will be received with value on the DTC settlement date but will be
available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account as of the business day for Euroclear or Clearstream
following the DTC settlement date.

DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the above procedures to facilitate transfers of interests in the global
notes among participants in those settlement systems. However, the settlement systems are not obligated to perform
these procedures and may discontinue or change these procedures at any time. Neither we nor the Trustee will have
any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their participants or indirect participants
of their obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Certificated Notes**

Notes in physical, certificated form will be issued and delivered to each person that DTC identifies as a beneficial
owner of the related notes only if:

    - DTC notifies us at any time that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the global notes
and a successor depositary is not appointed within 90 days;

    - DTC ceases to be registered as a clearing agency under the Exchange Act and a successor depositary is
not appointed within 90 days;

    - we, at our option, notify the Trustee that we elect to cause the issuance of certificated notes; or

    - certain other events provided in the indenture should occur.


-----

**CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following discussion is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership
and disposition of the notes by U.S. holders (as defined below), but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all
potential U.S. federal income tax effects. This discussion does not address prospective investors that are non-U.S.
persons. Such investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of an investment in the
notes. This summary does not address the effects of any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax
laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. This discussion is based upon the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury regulations issued thereunder, and judicial and
administrative interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change or
differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. No rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the
“IRS”) have been or are expected to be sought with respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no
assurance that the IRS will not take a different position concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
purchase, ownership or disposition of the notes or that any such position would not be sustained.

This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a holder in
light of such holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the unearned income Medicare contribution
tax, or to holders subject to special rules, such as financial institutions, U.S. expatriates, insurance companies,
dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities, U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar,
tax exempt entities, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships or other pass through
entities or arrangements and investors in such entities or arrangements, persons subject to special tax accounting
rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the notes being taken into account in an applicable
financial statement, persons liable for alternative minimum tax, U.S. holders that hold notes through non-U.S.
brokers or other non-U.S. intermediaries and persons holding the notes as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion
transaction” or other integrated transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, this discussion is
limited to U.S. holders who purchase the notes in the offering hereby for cash at original issue and at their “issue
price” (the first price at which a substantial amount of the notes is sold to investors for cash, excluding sales to bond
houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or
wholesalers) and who hold the notes as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally,
property held for investment).

If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the notes, the U.S.
federal income tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner and
the activities of the partner and the partnership. A partnership considering an investment in the notes, and partners in
such a partnership, should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
purchase, ownership and disposition of the notes.

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of a note that is, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation organized under the
laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) any estate the income of which is
subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) any trust if a court within the United States is
able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more “United States persons”
(within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the
trust, or if a valid election is in place to treat the trust as a United States person.

**Prospective investors in the notes should consult their tax advisors concerning the tax consequences of**
**holding notes in light of their particular circumstances, including the application of the U.S. federal income**
**tax considerations discussed below, as well as the application of other U.S. federal tax laws (such as estate and**
**gift tax laws) and state, local, non-U.S. or other tax laws.**

**Effect of Certain Contingencies**

In certain circumstances, we may be obligated to make payments on the notes in excess of stated principal and
interest, or to make payments in advance of their scheduled due dates (see, e.g., “Description of Notes—Additional
_Amounts” and “Description of Notes—Change of Control”). We intend to take the position that the foregoing_
contingencies should not cause the notes to be treated as contingent payment debt instruments. This position is
based, in part, on assumptions regarding the likelihood of such contingencies as of the date of issuance of the notes.


-----

Our position is binding on a holder unless the holder discloses in the proper manner to the IRS that it is taking a
different position. If the IRS successfully challenged our position, and the notes were treated as contingent payment
debt instruments, a U.S. holder could be required to accrue interest income at a rate higher than the stated interest
rate and to treat as ordinary income, rather than capital gain, any gain recognized on a sale, exchange, retirement or
redemption of a Note. This disclosure assumes that the notes will not be considered contingent payment debt
instruments. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the potential application of the
contingent payment debt instrument rules to the notes and the consequences thereof.

**Stated Interest**

Stated interest on the notes (including any additional amounts paid in respect of non-U.S. withholding taxes and
without reduction for any such tax withheld) generally will be includible in the gross income of a U.S. holder as
ordinary income at the time that the stated interest is received or accrued, in accordance with such U.S. holder’s
regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**Foreign Tax Credit**

A U.S. holder may be able to claim a credit (or, at such holder’s election, a deduction in lieu of such credit) with
respect to any non-U.S. withholding taxes deducted from a payment on the notes in computing such holder’s U.S.
federal income tax liability. Stated interest income on a Note generally will constitute foreign source income and
generally will be considered “passive category income” in computing the foreign tax credit. However, as discussed
below in “—Non-U.S. Holder—Potential U.S. Interest,” the IRS could argue that interest on the notes is treated as
U.S. source. There are significant complex limitations on a U.S. holder’s ability to claim foreign tax credits. U.S.
holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the creditability or deductibility of any withholding taxes.

**Sale, Exchange, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes**

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder generally will
recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized upon such disposition (less any
amount equal to any accrued but unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable as stated interest income as discussed
above in “—Stated Interest”) and such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note. A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax
basis in a Note generally will be the purchase price of such Note paid by such U.S. holder. Any gain or loss
recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note generally will be
U.S. source capital gain or loss (for foreign tax credit purposes) and generally will be long-term capital gain or loss
if the U.S. holder held the Note for more than one year on the date of disposition. Long-term capital gains of
non-corporate U.S. holders (including individuals) are generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The
deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

**Information Reporting and Backup Withholding**

In general, payments of stated interest on the notes and the proceeds of the sale or other disposition (including a
retirement or redemption) of a Note paid to a U.S. holder may be required to be reported to the IRS unless the U.S.
holder properly establishes that it is a corporation or other exempt recipient. Backup withholding may apply to such
payments if the U.S. holder fails to provide the applicable withholding agent with a taxpayer identification number
or a certification that it is not subject to backup withholding. U.S. holders may be required to provide such
certification on IRS Form W-9.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be
allowed as a refund or a credit against a U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability provided the required
information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**Tax Return Disclosure Requirements**

Individuals (and certain entities treated as individuals for this purpose) that own “specified foreign financial assets”
(which includes debt of foreign entities) with an aggregate value in excess of certain thresholds generally are
required to file an information report on IRS Form 8938 with respect to such assets with their tax returns. If a U.S.
holder does not file a required IRS Form 8938, such holder may be subject to substantial penalties and the statute of


-----

limitations on the assessment and collection of all U.S. federal income taxes of such holder for the related tax year
may not close before the date which is three years after the date on which such report is filed. The notes may
constitute specified foreign financial assets subject to these reporting requirements unless the notes are held in an
account at certain financial institutions. Under certain circumstances, an entity may be treated as an individual for
purposes of these rules.

U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing disclosure requirements to
their ownership of the notes, including the significant penalties for noncompliance.

**Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act**

Subject to the proposed regulations discussed below, a “foreign financial institution” may be required to withhold
U.S. tax on certain payments treated as attributable to certain U.S. source payments (so-called “foreign passthru
payments”). Currently, the term “foreign passthru payment” is not defined and it is unclear whether or to what
extent payments on the notes would be considered foreign passthru payments, assuming the Issuer were treated as a
foreign financial institution. If and when final Treasury regulations are published defining such term, the notes will
be considered “grandfathered” from FATCA because they were issued on or prior to the date that is six months after
the date on which such final Treasury regulations are published, unless the notes are materially modified after such
date. Under proposed Treasury regulations, any FATCA withholding on foreign passthru payments on debt
instruments that are not otherwise grandfathered would only apply to foreign passthru payments made on or after the
date that is two years after the date on which final Treasury regulations are published in the Federal Register
defining foreign passthru payments. Taxpayers generally may rely on these proposed Treasury regulations until final
Treasury regulations are issued.

Canada has entered into an intergovernmental agreement with the United States to implement FATCA in a manner
that may alter the rules described herein. Under the intergovernmental agreement, the Issuer may be required to
report certain information regarding investors to tax authorities in Canada, which information may be shared with
taxing authorities in the United States.

Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors on how FATCA may apply to their investment in the
notes.

In the event any FATCA withholding is imposed with respect to any payments on the notes, there will be no
Additional Amounts payable to compensate for the withheld amount.

**CERTAIN CANADIAN FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following summary describes the material Canadian federal income tax considerations pursuant to the Income
Tax Act (Canada) and the Income Tax Regulations (collectively, the “Tax Act”) generally applicable to a holder that
acquires as beneficial owner the notes pursuant to this offering, and beneficially owns all payments thereunder, and
that, for purposes of the Tax Act and all relevant times, holds the notes as capital property, deals at arm’s length
with the Company and each of the initial purchasers, and is not affiliated with the Company or any of the initial
purchasers (a “Holder”). Generally, the notes will be considered to be capital property to a Holder provided the
Holder does not hold the notes in the course of carrying on a business of trading or dealing in securities and has not
acquired them in one or more transactions considered to be an adventure or concern in the nature of trade.

This summary is based upon the provisions of the Tax Act in force as of the date hereof, all specific proposals to
amend the Tax Act that have been publicly announced by or on behalf of the Minister of Finance (Canada) prior to
the date hereof (the “Proposed Amendments”) and our understanding of the current administrative policies and
assessing practices of the Canada Revenue Agency (“CRA”) made publicly available prior to the date hereof. This
summary assumes the Proposed Amendments will be enacted in the form proposed. However, no assurance can be
given that the Proposed Amendments will be enacted in the form proposed, if at all. This summary is not exhaustive
of all possible Canadian federal income tax considerations and, except for the Proposed Amendments, does not take
into account any changes in the law, or administrative policy or assessing practice, whether by legislative,
administrative, governmental or judicial action or decision, nor does it take into account provincial, territorial or
foreign income tax considerations, which may differ significantly from those discussed herein.

**This summary is of a general nature only and is not intended to be, nor should it be construed to be, legal or**
**tax advice to any particular Holder or prospective Holder, and no representations with respect to the income**
**tax consequences to any Holder or prospective Holder are made. Consequently, Holders and prospective**
**Holders should consult their own tax advisors for advice with respect to the tax consequences to them of**
**acquiring notes pursuant to this offering, having regard to their particular circumstances.**

**Currency Conversion**

Generally, all amounts relating to the acquisition, holding or disposition of the notes, including adjusted cost base,
proceeds of disposition, and payments of interest must be converted into Canadian dollars for the purposes of the
Tax Act based on the daily noon rate as quoted by the Bank of Canada for the applicable day or such other rate of
exchange that is acceptable to the Minister of National Revenue (Canada). The amount of interest or capital gain or
capital loss of a Holder may therefore be affected by fluctuations in the Canadian/U.S. dollar exchange rate.

**Residents of Canada**

The following portion of the summary is applicable to a Holder that, at all relevant times and for the purposes of the
Tax Act and any applicable income tax treaty or convention is or is deemed to be resident in Canada (a “Resident
Holder”). Certain Resident Holders that might not otherwise be considered to hold their notes as capital property
may, in certain circumstances, be entitled to have their notes and all other “Canadian securities” (as defined in the
Tax Act) owned in the taxation year of the election and all subsequent taxation years deemed to be capital property
by making the irrevocable election permitted by subsection 39(4) of the Tax Act. Such Holders should consult their
own tax advisors for advice with respect to whether an election under subsection 39(4) of the Tax Act is available or
advisable having regard to their particular circumstances. The following portion of this summary is not applicable to
(i) a Holder that is a “financial institution”, as defined in the Tax Act for the purposes of the mark-to-market rules,
(ii) a Holder an interest in which would be a “tax shelter investment” as defined in the Tax Act, (iii) a Holder that is
a “specified financial institution” as defined in the Tax Act, (iv) a Holder that makes or has made a functional
currency reporting election pursuant to section 261 of the Tax Act to report its “Canadian tax results” as defined in
the Tax Act in a currency other than Canadian currency or (v) a holder that has entered or will enter into a
“derivative forward agreement” as defined in the Tax Act in respect of the notes. Any such Holder should consult its
own tax advisor with respect to an investment in the notes.


-----

_Interest on the Notes_

A Resident Holder of notes that is a corporation, partnership, unit trust or any trust of which a corporation or a
partnership is a beneficiary will be required to include in computing its income for a taxation year any interest on the
notes that accrues or is deemed to accrue to the Resident Holder to the end of the particular taxation year or that has
become receivable by, or is received by, the Resident Holder before the end of that taxation year, except to the
extent that such interest was included in computing the Resident Holder’s income for a preceding taxation year.

Any other Resident Holder, including an individual, will be required to include in computing its income for a
taxation year all interest on the notes that is received or receivable by the Holder in that taxation year (depending
upon the method regularly followed by the Resident Holder in computing income), except to the extent that the
interest was included in the Resident Holder’s income for a preceding taxation year. In addition, if at any time a note
should become an “investment contract” (as defined in the Tax Act) on any “anniversary day” (as defined in the Tax
Act) in relation to a Resident Holder (other than a corporation, partnership, unit trust or any trust of which a
corporation or a partnership is a beneficiary), such Resident Holder will be required to include in computing income
for the taxation year any interest that accrues or is deemed to accrue to the Resident Holder on the notes up to the
end of such anniversary day, to the extent such interest was not otherwise included in the Resident Holder’s income
for that year or a preceding year.

A Resident Holder of notes that throughout the relevant taxation year is a “Canadian-controlled private corporation”
(as defined in the Tax Act) may be liable to pay a refundable tax on its “aggregate investment income”, which is
defined in the Tax Act to include interest income.

_Redemption, Repayment or Disposition of Notes_

If the notes are redeemed prior to maturity or are repaid upon maturity, a Resident Holder will be considered to have
disposed of the notes for proceeds of disposition equal to the amount received by the Resident Holder (other than the
amount received on account of interest) on such redemption or repayment. The Resident Holder may realize a
capital gain or capital loss as described below.

Any amount paid by the Company as a penalty or bonus because of early repayment of all or part of the principal
amount of the notes will be deemed to be received by the Resident Holder as interest on the notes and will be
required to be included in the Resident Holder’s income as described above, to the extent such amount can
reasonably be considered to relate to, and does not exceed the value at the time of payment of, interest that would
otherwise have been payable on the notes for a taxation year of the Company ending after the payment of such
amount.

On a disposition or a deemed disposition of the notes, including repayment or purchase by the Company, a Resident
Holder will generally be required to include in income the amount of interest accrued or deemed to accrue to the
date of disposition, to the extent that such amounts have not otherwise been included in the Resident Holder’s
income for the year or a preceding taxation year.

In general, a disposition or a deemed disposition of notes by a Resident Holder will give rise to a capital gain (or a
capital loss) equal to the amount by which the proceeds of disposition, net of any amount included in computing the
Resident Holder’s income as interest and any reasonable costs of disposition, exceed (or are exceeded by) the
adjusted cost base of the notes to the Resident Holder immediately before the disposition.

Generally, one-half of any capital gain (a “taxable capital gain”) realized by a Resident Holder in a taxation year
must be included in the Resident Holder’s income for the year, and one-half of any capital loss (an “allowable
capital loss”) realized by a Resident Holder in a taxation year must be deducted from taxable capital gains realized
by the Resident Holder in that year. Allowable capital losses for a taxation year in excess of taxable capital gains
realized in a taxation year generally may be carried back and deducted in any of the three preceding taxation years
or carried forward and deducted in any subsequent taxation year against net taxable capital gains realized in such
years, to the extent and under the circumstances described in the Tax Act.


-----

A Resident Holder of notes that throughout the relevant taxation year is a “Canadian controlled private corporation”
(as defined in the Tax Act) may be liable to pay a refundable tax on its “aggregate investment income”, which is
defined in the Tax Act to include taxable capital gains.

Individuals or trusts (other than certain trusts) may be subject to an alternative minimum tax under the Tax Act upon
realizing net taxable capital gains.

**Eligibility for Investment**

Provided that the Company’s shares are listed on a “designated stock exchange” (which currently includes the TSX)
on the date of issue, the notes offered hereby will be, on the date of issue, qualified investments under the Tax Act
for trusts governed by registered retirement savings plans (“RRSPs”), registered retirement income funds (“RRIFs”),
deferred profit sharing plans (“DPSPs”), registered education savings plans (“RESPs”), registered disability savings
plans (“RDSPs”) and tax-free savings accounts (“TFSAs”) (except that such notes are not a qualified investment for
a trust governed by a DPSP for which any employer is the Company or is an employer with whom the Company
does not deal at arm’s length within the meaning of the Tax Act).

Notwithstanding that the notes may be a qualified investment for a trust governed by a TFSA, RRSP, RRIF, RESP
or RDSP, the holder of a TFSA or RDSP, the annuitant of a RRSP or RRIF or the subscriber of an RESP, as the case
may be, will be subject to a penalty tax in respect of the notes if held in the TFSA, RRSP, RRIF, RESP or RDSP, as
applicable, if the notes are a “prohibited investment” within the meaning of the Tax Act. The notes will not be a
“prohibited investment” for trusts governed by a TFSA, RRSP, RRIF, RESP or RDSP provided the holder of such
TFSA or RDSP, the annuitant of such RRSP or RRIF or the subscriber of the RESP, as applicable, (i) deals at arm’s
length with the Company for the purposes of the Tax Act, and (ii) does not have a “significant interest” (as defined
in the Tax Act) in the Company. Holders of TFSAs and RDSPs, annuitants of RRSPs and RRIFs and subscribers of
RESPs should consult their own tax advisors as to whether the notes will be “prohibited investments” in their
particular circumstances.

**Non-Residents of Canada**

The following portion of the summary is applicable to a Holder that, at all relevant times and for purposes of the Tax
Act, (i) is not resident and not deemed to be resident in Canada (including as a consequence of an applicable income
tax treaty or convention), (ii) does not use or hold the notes in carrying on business in Canada, (iii) deals at arm’s
length with any transferee resident (or deemed to be resident) in Canada to which the Holder disposes of notes,
(iv) is not an insurer who carries on an insurance business or is deemed to carry on an insurance business in Canada
and elsewhere, and (v) is not an “authorized foreign bank” (a “Non-Resident Holder”).

The following portion of this summary is not applicable to a Non-Resident Holder that is a “specified shareholder”
(as defined in subsection 18(5) the Tax Act) of the Company or that does not deal at arm’s length for purposes of the
Tax Act with a “specified shareholder” of the Company.

Generally, for this purpose, a “specified shareholder” is a shareholder that owns or is deemed to own, either alone or
together with persons with which the shareholder does not deal at arm’s length for purposes of the Tax Act, shares
of the capital stock of the Company that either (i) give such holders 25% or more of the votes that could be cast at an
annual meeting of the shareholders or (ii) have a fair market value of 25% or more of the fair market value of all of
the issued and outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Company. Such Non-Resident Holders should consult
their own tax advisors.

**Taxation of Notes**

Amounts paid or credited, or deemed to be paid or credited, as, on account or in lieu of payment of, or in satisfaction
of, the principal of the notes or as premium, discount or interest on the notes by the Company to a Non-Resident
Holder, and proceeds received by a Non-Resident Holder on a disposition or deemed disposition of the notes will
not be subject to Canadian withholding tax. No other taxes on income (including taxable capital gains) will be
payable under the Tax Act by a Non-Resident Holder in respect of the ownership or disposition of notes.

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase and holding of the notes by (a)
employee benefit plans that are subject to Title I of ERISA, (b) plans, individual retirement accounts and other
arrangements that are subject to Section 4975 of the Code or provisions under any other federal, state, local, nonU.S. or other laws or regulations that are similar to such provisions of ERISA or the Code (collectively, “Similar
Laws”), and (c) entities or accounts whose underlying assets are considered to include “plan assets” of any such
plan, account or arrangement described in clause (a) or (b) (each of the foregoing described in clauses (a) (b), and
(c) referred to as a “Plan”).

**General Fiduciary Matters**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to Title I of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code (an “ERISA Plan”) and prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan
and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any
discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition
of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such an
ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan.

Non-U.S. plans, U.S. governmental plans and certain U.S. church plans, while not subject to the fiduciary
responsibility provisions of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code
(as discussed below), may nevertheless be subject to Similar Laws. Fiduciaries of any such plans should consult
with their counsel before purchasing the notes to determine the suitability of the notes for such plan and the need for,
and the availability, if necessary, of any exemptive relief under any such laws or regulations.

In considering an investment in the notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should determine whether
the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable
provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without
limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the
Code and any other applicable Similar Laws.

In addition, a fiduciary should consider the fact that none of the issuer, initial purchasers, or guarantors, or any of
their respective affiliates (collectively, the “Transaction Parties”), will act as a fiduciary to any Plan with respect to
the decision to purchase or hold notes and none of the Transaction Parties is undertaking to provide any advice,
including, without limitation, in a fiduciary capacity, with respect to such decision. The decision to purchase and
hold the notes must be made by each prospective Plan purchaser on an arms’ length basis.

**Prohibited Transaction Issues**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified transactions
involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of ERISA, or
“disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption is available. A party in
interest or disqualified person who engaged in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes
and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that
engaged in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and/or
the Code. The purchase and/or holding of notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which a Transaction Party is
considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited
transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and held
in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the
U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions, or “PTCEs,” that may apply to the
purchase and holding of the notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting
transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance
company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60
respecting life insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house
asset managers. Each of the above-noted exemptions contains conditions and limitations on its application.
Fiduciaries of ERISA Plans considering purchasing and/or holding the notes in reliance of these or any other


-----

exemption should carefully review the exemption to assure it is applicable. There can be no assurance that all of the
conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied.

Because of the foregoing, the notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing “plan assets” of any
Plan unless such purchase and holding will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA and the
Code or a violation of any applicable Similar Laws.

**Representation**

Accordingly, by acceptance of a note, each purchaser and subsequent transferee of a note (or any interest therein)
will be deemed to have represented and warranted that either (i) no portion of the assets used by such purchaser or
transferee to purchase or hold the notes (or any interest therein) constitutes assets of any Plan or (ii) the purchase
and holding of the notes by such purchaser or transferee will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction
under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a violation under any applicable Similar Laws, and
none of the Transaction Parties is acting as a fiduciary to such purchaser or transferee, nor undertaking to provide
any advice in a fiduciary or other capacity, with respect to the purchase or holding of the notes (or of any interest in
the notes).

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all inclusive. Due to the complexity of these
rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is
particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering purchasing the notes on behalf of, or with the
assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the
Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase and
holding of the notes.

The purchase agreement provides that the obligations of the initial purchasers to purchase the notes are subject to
customary closing conditions. The initial purchasers must purchase all the notes if they purchase any of the notes. If
an initial purchaser defaults, the purchase agreement provides that the purchase commitments of the non-defaulting
initial purchasers may be increased or the purchase agreement may be terminated.

The issuer and the guarantors have jointly and severally agreed to indemnify the initial purchasers against certain
liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments the initial purchasers may be
required to make in respect of those liabilities.

The initial purchasers propose to resell the notes at the offering price set forth on the cover page of this offering
memorandum to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers (as defined in Rule 144A) in
reliance on Rule 144A and outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S. See “Transfer Restrictions.” The
price at which the notes are offered may be changed at any time without notice. The initial purchasers may offer and
sell notes through certain of their affiliates. The initial purchasers reserve the right to reject, cancel or modify an
order of the notes in whole or in part.

The notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and may not
be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (as defined in
Regulation S) except in transactions exempt from, or not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities
Act. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

In addition, with respect to the notes initially sold outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S, until
40 days following the closing of this offering, an offer or sale of notes within the United States by a dealer (whether
or not participating in this offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act unless the dealer
makes the offer or sale in compliance with Rule 144A or another exemption from registration under the Securities
Act.

We and the guarantors have agreed that during the period from the date of this offering memorandum through and
including the date that is 60 days following the date of this offering memorandum, we and the guarantors will not
without the prior written consent of the representative, directly or indirectly, offer for sale, sell, or otherwise dispose
of (or enter into any transaction or device that is designed to, or would be expected to, result in the disposition by
any person at any time in the future), or publically announce the offering of, or file (or cause to be filed) any
registration statement under the Securities Act in respect of, any debt securities of the issuer or the guarantors
substantially similar to the notes offered hereby or securities exchangeable for or convertible into such debt
securities of the issuer or the guarantors (other than as contemplated by the purchase agreement), or sell or grant
options, rights, or warrants with respect to such debt securities (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for
such debt securities) or enter into any swap or other derivatives transaction that transfers, in whole or in part, any of
the economic benefits or risks of ownership of such debt securities.


-----

The notes will constitute a new class of securities with no established trading market. We do not intend to list the
notes on any national securities exchange. We cannot assure you that the prices at which the notes will sell in the
market after this offering will not be lower than the initial offering price or that an active trading market for the
notes will develop and continue after this offering. The initial purchasers have advised us that they currently intend
to make a market in the notes. However, they are not obligated to do so and they may discontinue any marketmaking activities with respect to the notes at any time without notice. Accordingly, we cannot assure you as to the
liquidity of, or the trading market for, the notes.

You should be aware that the laws and practices of certain countries require investors to pay stamp taxes and other
charges in connection with purchases of securities. In connection with the offering, the initial purchasers may
purchase and sell notes in the open market. Purchases and sales in the open market may include short sales,
purchases to cover short positions, and stabilizing purchases. Short sales involve sales by the initial purchasers of a
greater number of notes than they are required to purchase in the offering. Covering transactions involve purchases
of notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Stabilizing
transactions involve bids to purchase notes so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum.
Purchases to cover short positions and stabilizing purchases, as well as other purchases by the initial purchasers for
their own accounts, may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the notes. They
may also cause the price of the notes to be higher than the price that would otherwise exist in the open market in the
absence of these transactions. The initial purchasers may conduct these transactions in the over-the-counter market
or otherwise. If the initial purchasers commence any of these transactions, they may discontinue them at any time.

The initial purchasers are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include
securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, corporate advisory, investment
management, principal investment, hedging, financing, and brokerage activities. Certain of the initial purchasers
and/or their respective affiliates have in the past performed commercial banking, investment banking, and advisory
services for us from time to time for which they have received customary fees and reimbursement of expenses and
may, from time to time, engage in transactions with and perform services for us in the ordinary course of their
business for which they may receive customary fees and reimbursement of expenses. In the ordinary course of their
various business activities, the initial purchasers and their respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of
investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments
(which may include bank loans and/or credit default swaps) for their own account and for the accounts of their
customers and may at any time hold long and short positions in such securities and instruments. Such investments
and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates.

The initial purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express
independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to
clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. If the initial purchasers or
their affiliates have a lending relationship with us, certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates routinely hedge,
and certain other of the initial purchasers or their affiliates may hedge, their credit exposure to us consistent with
their customary risk-management policies. A typical such hedging strategy would include these initial purchasers or
their affiliates hedging such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit
default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the notes offered hereby. Any
such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the notes.

Certain of the initial purchasers and/or their respective affiliates act as agents and/or lenders under the Existing
Credit Agreement. We intend to use the proceeds from this offering to repay in full outstanding borrowings and
terminate commitments under our Existing Credit Agreement and to pay related financing fees and expenses.
Accordingly, certain of the initial purchasers and/or their respective affiliates will receive a portion of the proceeds
from this offering. See “Use of Proceeds.” BBVA USA is the administrative agent and collateral agent under the
Existing Credit Agreement and will be the administrative agent and collateral agent under the New Revolving Credit
Facility and as such has and will receive fees in connection therewith. Certain of the other initial purchasers and/or
their respective affiliates will be lenders, agents and/or arrangers under the New Revolving Credit Facility and, as
consideration therefor, have received or will receive customary fees and expenses in connection with the New
Revolving Credit Facility.

**Settlement**

It is expected that delivery of the notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the date specified on the
cover of this offering memorandum, which is the    business day following the date of pricing of the notes (such
settlement cycle being referred to as “T+   ”). Under Rule 15c-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary
market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree
otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the notes prior to the date that is two business days preceding
the settlement date will be required, by virtue of the fact that the notes initially will settle in T+  , to specify an
alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent failed settlement. Purchasers of the notes who
wish to trade the notes during such period should consult their own advisor.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in the European Economic Area**

The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered sold or
otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). For these purposes, a retail
investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of
Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2002/92/EC (as
amended, the “Insurance Mediation Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as
defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Directive 2003/71/EC
(as amended, the “Prospectus Directive”). Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU)
No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them
available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the notes or otherwise
making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation. This
offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of notes in any Member State of the EEA will
be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Directive from the requirement to publish a prospectus for
offers of notes. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Directive.

The above selling restriction is in addition to any other selling restrictions set out below.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in the United Kingdom**

Obligations or a listing prospectus within the meaning of the listing rules of the SIX Swiss Exchange or any other
regulated trading facility in Switzerland. Any offering or marketing material relating to the notes may not be

person for the purpose of issue (in each case whether in Hong Kong or elsewhere), which is directed at, or the
contents of which are likely to be accessed or read by, the public in Hong Kong (except if permitted to do so under
the laws of Hong Kong) other than with respect to notes which are or are intended to be disposed of only to persons
outside Hong Kong or only to “professional investors” within the meaning of the Securities and Futures Ordinance

Exchange Law and any other applicable laws, regulations and ministerial guidelines of Japan.

###### 3 Summary of significant accounting policies 

These condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the significant
accounting policies consistent with those applied in the Company’s December 31, 2019 consolidated financial
statements, except as described below relating to the amendments to IFRS 3, IAS 1 and IAS 8 which became
effective January 1, 2020.

Definition of a Business – Amendments to IFRS 3: The amended definition of a business requires an
acquisition to include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to
create outputs. The definition of the term ‘outputs’ is amended to focus on goods and services provided to
customers, generating investment income and other income, and it excludes returns in the form of lower costs
and other economic benefits.

Definition of Material – Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8: The IASB has made amendments to IAS 1,
Presentation of Financial Statements ("IAS 1") and IAS 8, Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting
Estimates and Errors to use a consistent definition of materiality throughout IFRS and the Conceptual
Framework for Financial Reporting, and clarify when information is material and incorporate some of the
guidance in IAS 1 about immaterial information.

The adoption of the amendments to these standards did not have a material impact on the interim consolidated
financial statements in the current or comparative periods. The Company was not required to make
retrospective adjustments as a result of adopting these standards.

A portion of the purchase price payable in respect of the ADG Acquisitions in 2019, specifically for SFL
Radiology Holdings, LLC (Georgia business), is subject to an earn-out (the ADG Acquisition – earn-out liability)
based on its annualized revenues earned in the first two quarters of 2020 less certain costs including certain
operating expenses, capital expenditures and incremental working capital. In accordance with the purchase
agreement, 50% of this liability is expected to be settled in the latter half of 2020 and the balance in the first half
of 2021.

The value of the ADG Acquisition – earn-out liability was estimated by management using a probability
weighted valuation technique; changes in the fair value of this liability are recognized in the consolidated

liabilities (it is considered a Level 3 liability as described in note 14). As at December 31, 2019, the Amended
May 2019 Loans had a balance of approximately, $339.4 million. In June 2020, the amendment costs related to
the Amended May 2019 Credit Agreement were netted against the balance of the Amended May 2019 Loans.

accounting purposes and a loss of approximately $3.1 million was recognized as a result of this amendment in
the condensed interim consolidated statements of net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss). As at
June 30, 2020, the Amended May 2019 Loans had an amortized cost balance of approximately, $346.6 million.

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

Effective November 14, 2018, the Company entered into a derivative financial instrument contract with a financial
institution in order to mitigate interest rate risk under the variable interest rate Syndicated Loans (which were
settled in 2019). The derivative financial instrument is an interest rate cap rate of 3.75% (LIBOR) per annum on
a notional amount of 50% of the face value of the Syndicated Term Loan ($50,000,000 as at November 14, 2018).
The termination date of this arrangement is August 31, 2021. The cost of this derivative financial instrument was
$155,000. The Company has not designated this interest rate cap agreement as a cash flow hedge for accounting
purposes. The fair value of this derivative as determined by the financial institution as at June 30, 2020
represented an asset to the Company of $43.

In addition, effective July 31, 2019, the Company entered into a derivative financial instrument, an interest rate
collar contract (further amended in November 2019 and February 2020), with a financial institution in order to
mitigate interest rate risk under the variable interest rate Term Loans. This derivative financial instrument has an
underlying notional amount of 100% of the face value of Term Loan B ($266,000,000 as at July 31, 2019) and a
termination date of July 31, 2022 with (i) a cap rate of 3.00% (LIBOR) per annum, and (ii) a floor rate of 1.1475%
(LIBOR) per annum. There was no upfront cost of this derivative financial instrument. The Company has not
designated this interest rate cap agreement as a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes. The fair value of this
derivative as determined by the Company as at June 30, 2020 represented a liability to the Company of
$5,190,000.

Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in the condensed interim consolidated statements
of net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss).

The Amended May 2019 Credit Agreement provides for the following (capitalized terms used below in this note
and not defined elsewhere in these notes have the respective meanings given to them in the Amended May
2019 Credit Agreement):

     - Interest

The interest rates payable on the Amended May 2019 Loans are as follows: (i) each Eurodollar Rate
Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount at one-month LIBOR plus Applicable
Rate; and (ii) each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount at the
Base Rate (the highest of (a) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5%, (b) the prime rate and (c) Eurodollar
Rate plus 1.0%) plus Applicable Rate. As part of the amendments on June 2, 2020, an additional
paid-in-kind interest accrues on the outstanding Term B Loans from time to time, which interest rate
shall be (i) 2.00% per annum from June 2, 2020 to March 31, 2021, and (ii) thereafter the applicable
percentage per annum will be determined by reference to the leverage ratio thresholds in the
Amended May 2019 Credit Agreement. All advances under the Amended May 2019 Loans are
currently classified as Eurodollar Rate Loans. The annualized effective interest rate under the
Amended May 2019 Credit Agreement as at June 30, 2020 was approximately 7.3% per annum
(June 30, 2019 – 7.7%). With respect to interest rate sensitivity as at June 30, 2020, a 1% increase in

###### 12 Commitments and contingencies

The Company is party to various legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and
investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business. With respect to these matters, the management
evaluates the developments on a regular basis and accrues a liability when it believes a loss is probable and
the amount can be reasonably estimated. We believe that the amount or any estimable range of reasonably
possible or probable loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our
business and consolidated financial statements. However, the outcome of these matters is inherently uncertain.
Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against the Company for amounts in excess of
management's expectations, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting
period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected.

Commencing during Q1 2020 and continuing through Q2 2020 and beyond, a pandemic relating to a novel
coronavirus known as COVID-19 occurred causing significant financial market disruption and social dislocation.
The pandemic is dynamic with various cities, counties, states and countries around the world responding in
different ways to address and contain the outbreak, including the declaration of a global pandemic by the World
Health Organization, a National State of Emergency in the United States and state and local executive orders
and ordinances forcing the closure of non essential businesses and persons not employed in or using essential
services to “stay at home” or “shelter in place”. At this stage, we have no certainty as to how long the
pandemic, or a more limited epidemic, will last, what regions will be most affected or to what extent
containment measures will be applied.

Imaging centers are healthcare facilities and as such are generally considered an essential service and
expected to continue to operate during any epidemic or pandemic. However, there is potential that actions
taken by government, or individual actions, in response to containment or avoidance of this coronavirus could
impact a patient’s ability or decision to seek imaging services at a given time which could have a significant
impact on volume at our imaging centers leading to temporary or prolonged staff layoffs, reduced hours,
closures and other cost containment efforts. Further, there is potential that certain services which are not
urgent and can be deferred without significant harm to a patient’s health may be delayed, either by the
Company in response to local laws or good public health practice or voluntarily by the patient. In addition, there
is potential that the outbreak of the coronavirus could impact supply chains, including the Company’s supply of

personal protective equipment, and lead to personnel shortages, each of which could impact the ability of the
Company to safely perform imaging services. It is also possible that social distancing efforts and sanitization
and decontamination procedures could cause delays in the performance of imaging services. Depending on the
severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is potential for the Company to incur incremental credit
losses beyond what is currently expected and potential future reduction in revenue and income and asset
impairments.

###### 13 Segmented financial information

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief
operating decision maker. The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and
assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer. The
Company has one reportable segment, which is outpatient diagnostic imaging services.

###### 14 Risk management arising from financial instruments

The carrying value of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities and leases (current
portion) approximates their fair value given their short-term nature.

The carrying value of the non-current portion of leases approximates their fair value given the difference
between the discount rates used to recognize the liabilities in the condensed interim consolidated balance
sheets and the normalized expected market rates of interest is insignificant. The estimated fair values of other
non-current liabilities were as follows:


**June 30,**

**2020**

**$**


**December 31,**

**2019**

**$**


Amended May 2019 loans payable 372,896,500 360,596,500

Derivative financial instruments 5,189,957 951,105

385,796,621 378,049,987

Financial instruments recorded at fair value on the condensed interim consolidated balance sheets are
classified using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the
measurements. The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:

- Level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

- Level 2 – inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability;
either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices); and

- Level 3 – inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable
inputs).

The Amended May 2019 Loans, Wesley Chapel Loan, Subordinated Notes – Earn-out and ADG Acquisition –
Earn-out were measured at fair value under the Level 3 category on recognition. The Subordinated Notes –

Earn-out and ADG Acquisition – Earn-out were subsequently remeasured at fair value under the Level 3
category.

There were no transfers between levels during the three months ended June 30, 2020 and the twelve months
ended December 31, 2019.

Financial instruments are classified into one of the following categories: amortized cost, fair value through profit
or loss and fair value through other comprehensive income.

###### Independent auditor’s report

 To the Shareholders of Akumin Inc.

 Opinion

 We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Akumin Inc. (the Company), which comprise

 the consolidated balance sheet as at December 31, 2019, and the consolidated statement of net income

 and comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of

 cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a

 summary of significant accounting policies.

 In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material

 respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as at December 31, 2019 and of its

 consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in

 accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

 Basis for opinion

 We conducted our audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards (Canadian

 GAAS) and auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAS). Our

 responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the

 audit of the consolidated financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company

 in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial

 statements in Canada and the United States, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in

 accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient

 and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

 Emphasis of a matter – Adoption of IFRS 16

 As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method for

 accounting for leases in 2019 due to the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standard 16,

 Leases, and the related amendments. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.


-----

###### Other matter

 The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2018, were

 audited by another auditor who expressed an unmodified opinion on those consolidated financial

 statements on November 13, 2019.

 Other information

 Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises Management’s

 Discussion and Analysis.

 Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do

 not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 

 In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the

 other information, and in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent

 with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears

 to be materially misstated.

 We obtained Management’s Discussion and Analysis prior to the date of this auditor’s report. If, based

 on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other

 information, we are required to report that fact in this auditor’s report. We have nothing to report in this

 regard.

 Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the consolidated

 financial statements

 Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial

 statements in accordance with IFRSs, and for such internal control as management determines is

 necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material

 misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

 In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the

 Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going


-----

###### concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate

 the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

 Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting

 process.

 Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements

 Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements

 as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s

 report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a

 guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Canadian GAAS or U.S. GAAS will always detect a

 material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered

 material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic

 decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

 As part of an audit in accordance with Canadian GAAS and U.S. GAAS, we exercise professional judgment

 and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

 • Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,

 whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks,

 and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

 The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one

 resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,

 misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

 • Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit

 procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an

 opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such

 opinion.

 • Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting

 estimates and related disclosures made by management.


-----

###### • Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting

 and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to

 events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a

 going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw

 attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial

 statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are

 based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future

 events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.

 • Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial

 statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements

 represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

 We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned

 scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies and

 material weaknesses in internal control that we identify during our audit.

 We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant

 ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and

 other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable,

 related safeguards.

 The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Maria Camila Cote.

###### 2 Summary of significant accounting policies

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).

The significant accounting policies described below have been applied consistently to all periods presented.
Certain comparative information has been reclassified to conform with the presentation adopted in the current
fiscal period.

These consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors (the Board) and authorized
for issue by the Board on March 30, 2020.

**Basis of presentation**

The consolidated financial statements include all of the accounts of the Company and the Subsidiaries. All
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated on consolidation.

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
**December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018**

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

**Functional and reporting currency and foreign currency translation**

The functional and reporting currency of the Company and the Subsidiaries is US dollars. Monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into US dollars at the rates of exchange prevailing at
the consolidated balance sheet dates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at rates prevailing at
the dates of acquisition. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average rate of exchange in effect
during the month the transaction occurred. All exchange gains and losses are recognized in the current year’s
earnings.

**Cash**

Cash includes cash on hand and cash held with banks.

**Property and equipment**

Property and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the
declining balance method, unless stated otherwise, as follows:

Medical equipment and equipment under finance leases 20%

Computer and office equipment 30%

Furniture and fittings 15%

Leasehold improvements straight-line over

term of lease

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Operating lease buyouts and
significant upgrades are capitalized.

**Intangible assets**

The Company classifies intangible assets, obtained through acquisitions or developed internally, as definite
lived. Intangible assets consist of software costs, trade name, license arrangements and covenants not to
compete; these intangible assets are recorded at cost and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, using
the declining balance method, unless stated otherwise, as follows:

Software costs, trade name and license arrangements 20%

Covenant not to compete straight-line over

term of contract

The Company reviews the appropriateness of the amortization period related to the definite lived intangible
assets annually.

**Goodwill**

Goodwill is recognized as the fair value of the consideration transferred, less the fair value of the net identifiable
assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as at the acquisition date. Subsequent to initial recognition, goodwill is
measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill acquired in business combinations is allocated
to groups of cash generating units (CGUs) that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
The determination of CGUs and the level at which goodwill is monitored requires judgment by management.


-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
**December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018**

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

The Company’s CGUs generally represent individual business units below the level of the Company’s operating
segment. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment as at October 1 and as required when impairment
indicators exist, by comparing the carrying value of the CGUs against the recoverable amount (higher of value
in use and fair value less costs to sell).

**Impairment of long-lived assets**

The Company assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that a long-lived asset may be
impaired. If any indication exists, the Company estimates the recoverable amount. For the purpose of
impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of
assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other
CGUs. The recoverable amount of an asset or a CGU is the higher of its fair value, less costs to sell, and its
value in use.

Fair value less costs to sell is the amount obtainable from the sale of an asset or CGU in an arm’s length
transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties, less the costs to sell. Costs of disposal are incremental
costs directly attributable to the disposal of an asset and income tax expense.

In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the
asset or CGU.

If the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment charge is recognized
immediately in the consolidated statements of net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) by the
amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or CGU exceeds the recoverable amount. Where an
impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (except goodwill) or CGU is increased
to the lesser of the revised estimate of the recoverable amount, and the carrying amount that would have been
recorded had no impairment loss been recognized previously.

**Segment reporting**

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief
operating decision maker. The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and
assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer. The
Company has one reportable segment, which is outpatient diagnostic imaging services.

**Revenue recognition**

The Company adopted IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (IFRS 15), as at January 1, 2018,
with full retrospective application. Service fee revenue, net of contractual allowances and discounts, consists of
net patient fees received from various payers and patients based mainly on established contractual billing
rates, less allowances for contractual adjustments and discounts and allowances. This service fee revenue is
primarily comprised of fees for the use of the Company’s diagnostic imaging equipment and provision of
medical supplies.


-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
**December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018**

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

Service fee revenue is recorded during the period in which the Company’s performance obligations are
satisfied, based on the estimated collectible amounts from the patients and third party payers. The Company’s
performance obligations are satisfied when services are rendered to the patient. Third party payers include
federal and state agencies (under the Medicare and Medicaid programs), managed care health plans,
commercial insurance companies, attorneys, and employers. Estimates of contractual allowances are based on
the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements. A provision for credit losses is also
recorded in accordance with IFRS 9. The Company regularly attempts to estimate its expected reimbursement
for patients based on the applicable contract terms. The Company believes its review process enables it to
identify instances on a timely basis where such estimates need to be revised.

Other revenue consists of miscellaneous fees under contractual arrangements, including service fee revenue
under capitation arrangements with third party payers, management fees and fees for other services provided
to third parties. Revenue is recorded during the period in which the Company’s performance obligations under
the contract are satisfied by the Company.

IFRS 15 applies a single model for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers. It requires revenue to
be recognized in a manner that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to a customer and at an
amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring those goods or
services. This is achieved by applying the following five steps:

i) identify the contract with a customer;

ii) identify the performance obligation in the contract;

iii) determine the transaction price;

iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and

v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.

**Earnings per share**

Basic earnings per common share (EPS) is calculated by dividing the net earnings available to common
shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is
calculated by adjusting the net earnings available to common shareholders and the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive instruments.

**Income taxes**

Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognized in the consolidated
statements of net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss). Current income tax expense represents the
amount of income taxes payable based on tax law that is enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting
date, and is adjusted for changes in estimates of tax expense recognized in prior periods. A current tax liability
or asset is recognized for income taxes payable, or paid but recoverable, in respect of all periods to date.


-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
**December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018**

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

The Company uses the deferred tax method of accounting for income taxes. Accordingly, deferred tax assets
and liabilities are recognized for the deferred tax consequences attributable to differences between the
consolidated financial statements’ carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted or substantively enacted tax rates expected to
apply to taxable income in the periods in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the
consolidated statements of net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) in the period in which the
enactment or substantive enactment occurs. A deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses, tax
credits and deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it is more likely than not that future taxable
income will be available to utilize such amounts. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and
are adjusted to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefits will be realized. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and the
Company intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

**Financial instruments**

On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted IFRS 9, Financial Instruments (IFRS 9), retrospectively. IFRS 9
addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and liabilities. It establishes three
measurement categories for financial assets: amortized cost, fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) and fair
value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). The basis of classification depends on the entity’s
business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.

Under IFRS 9, financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost unless they are required to be measured at
FVTPL or the Company has opted to measure them at FVTPL.

**a)** **Measurement of financial assets and liabilities**

Financial assets (such as cash and accounts receivable) and liabilities (such as accounts payable,
accrued liabilities, leases and loans) at amortized cost are initially recognized at fair value, and
subsequently are carried at amortized cost less any impairment. Derivative financial instruments and earnouts are initially recognized and subsequently measured at fair value.

**b)** **Impairment of financial assets**

The expected credit loss (ECL) model under IFRS 9 applies to financial assets measured at amortized
cost, contract assets and debt instruments measured at FVOCI, but not to investments in equity
instruments.

Under IFRS 9, expected credit losses are measured as follows:

      - twelve-month ECL – ECLs that result from possible default events within twelve months after the
reporting date; and

      - lifetime ECLs – ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial
instrument.


-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
**December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018**

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

The Company measures provision for credit losses at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs, except for the
following, which are measured based on twelve-month ECLs:

      - cash and loans to related parties for which the risk of default occurring over the expected life of the
financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition.

In applying the IFRS 9 impairment requirements, the Company applies the general approach for cash and
loans to related parties, while the Company measures provision for credit losses for accounts receivable at
an amount equal to lifetime ECLs using the simplified approach.

In order to assess whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial
recognition and when estimating ECLs, the Company considers reasonable and supportable information
that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes information based on the
Company’s historical experience and other forward-looking information. The maximum period considered
when estimating ECLs is the maximum contractual period over which the Company is exposed to credit
risk.

**c)** **Measurement of ECLs**

ECLs are a probability weighted estimate of provision for credit losses. Provision for credit losses is
measured as the present value of the difference between the cash flows due to the Company in
accordance with the contract and the cash flows the Company expects to receive. ECLs are discounted at
the effective interest rate of the financial asset; however, due to the short-term nature of most of the
Company’s financial assets measured at amortized cost, the time value of money is not expected to be
significant in the calculation of the ECL.

For accounts receivable, the Company uses a provision matrix to determine the ECLs based on actual
credit loss experience with consideration of forward-looking information including changes to economic
conditions that would impact its customers.

The Company applies the general approach for loans to related parties, considering any significant
increases in credit risk for such receivables since inception. In determining the ECLs for such receivables,
the Company considers actual credit loss experience with consideration of forward-looking information
including changes to economic conditions that would impact the payers.

**Leases**

During 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16, Leases (IFRS 16), replacing IAS 17, Leases (IAS 17) and related
interpretations. The standard introduces a single, on-balance sheet recognition and measurement model for
lessees, eliminating the distinction between operating and finance leases. Lessees recognize a right-of-use
asset representing its control of and right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its
obligation to make future lease payments. As a result of adoption of IFRS 16 on January 1, 2019, the Company
has recognized an increase of $98,744,716 to both property and equipment and lease liabilities on its
consolidated balance sheets. Lessor accounting remains similar to IAS 17.


-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
**December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018**

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

IFRS 16 became effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019. For leases where the
Company is the lessee, it had the option of adopting a fully retrospective approach or a modified retrospective
approach on transition to IFRS 16. The Company adopted the standard on January 1, 2019 using the modified
retrospective approach. The Company applied the requirements of the standard retrospectively with no
restatement of the comparative period. Under the modified retrospective approach, the Company chose to
measure all right-of-use assets retrospectively as if the standard had been applied since lease commencement
dates, which is January 1, 2019 for purposes of the Company’s IFRS 16 adoption. Substantially all of the
Company’s operating leases are real estate leases for its imaging centres and corporate offices and for medical
equipment. Other leased assets include office equipment. The Company recognized right-of-use assets and
lease liabilities for its operating leases except for certain classes of underlying assets in which the underlying
asset was considered to be of low-value; however, the Company may choose to elect the recognition
exemptions regarding short-term leases on a class-by-class basis for new classes, and lease-by-lease basis,
respectively, in the future. Due to the removal of rent expense for leases, the Company’s operating expenses
are reduced with a corresponding increase to depreciation and an increase to interest costs (due to accretion of
the lease liability). There are no significant impacts to the Company’s existing finance leases under IAS 17 as a
lessee.

IFRS 16 permits the use of recognition exemptions and practical expedients. The Company applied the
following recognition exemptions and practical expedients:

    - grandfathered the definition of leases for existing contracts at the date of initial application;

    - excluded certain low-value leases from IFRS 16 lease accounting;

    - applied a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics at the date of
initial application;

    - excluded initial direct costs from the measurement of right-of-use assets at the date of initial application;

    - used hindsight in determining lease term at the date of initial application; and

    - relied on its assessment of whether leases are onerous applying IAS 37, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities
and Contingent Assets, immediately before the date of initial application as an alternative to performing an
impairment review.

The Company used its incremental borrowing rates as at January 1, 2019 to measure lease liabilities. The
weighted average incremental borrowing rate for total lease liabilities as at January 1, 2019 was 6.7%. Prior to
adopting IFRS 16, the Company’s total minimum operating lease commitments as at December 31, 2018 were
$163,728,644. These lease commitments included expected exercise of optional renewal terms for most of the
leases. The difference between this amount and the lease liabilities of $98,744,716 recognized on transition on
January 1, 2019 was due to the effect of discounting on the minimum lease payments.


-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
**December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018**

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

**Changes to accounting policies for leases**

The Company did not restate prior year comparative information under the modified retrospective approach.
Therefore, the comparative information continues to be reported under IAS 17 and related interpretations.

**Lessee accounting policy as a lessee**

Applicable from January 1, 2019, the Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability based on
the present value of future lease payments when a lessor makes the leased asset available for use by the
Company. Lease payments for assets that are exempt through the low-value exemption are recognized in
operating expenses. The measurement of lease liabilities includes the fixed and in-substance fixed payments
and variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, less any lease incentives receivable. Certain
leases require the Company to make payments that relate to property taxes, insurance and other non-rental
costs. These costs are typically variable and are not included in the calculation of the right-of-use asset or lease
liability. If applicable, lease liabilities will also include the purchase option exercise price if the Company is
reasonably certain to exercise that option, termination penalties if the lease term also reflects the termination
option and amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee. Subsequent to initial
measurement, the Company measures lease liabilities at amortized cost using the effective interest method.
Lease liabilities are remeasured when there is a change in lease term, a change in the assessment of an option
to purchase the leased asset, a change in expected residual value guarantee, or a change in future lease
payments.

The right-of-use assets are measured at the initial amount of the lease liabilities plus any lease payments made
at or before the commencement date net of lease incentives received, and decommissioning costs.
Subsequent to initial measurement, the Company applies the cost model to the right-of-use assets. Right-ofuse assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation, accumulated impairment losses governed by
IAS 36 and any remeasurements of lease liabilities. The assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the
earlier of the end of the assets’ useful lives or the end of the lease terms.

Discount rates used in the present value calculation are the interest rates implicit in the leases, or if the rates
cannot be readily determined, the Company’s incremental borrowing rates. Lease terms applied are the
contractual non-cancellable periods of the leases plus periods covered by an option to renew the leases if the
Company expects to exercise that option and the periods covered by an option to terminate the leases if the
Company expects not to exercise that option.

The Company has elected to not separate fixed non-lease components from lease components and instead
account for each lease component and associated fixed non-lease components as a single lease component.

**Critical accounting estimates and judgments for leases**

The management exercises judgment in determining the appropriate lease term on a lease-by-lease basis. The
management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise a renewal
option or to not exercise a termination option including operational performance and past business practice.
The periods covered by renewal options are only included in the lease term if the management expects to
renew. Changes in the economic environment or changes in the industry may impact the management’s


-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
**December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018**

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

assessment of lease term, and any changes in the management’s estimate of lease terms may have a material
impact on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and the consolidated statements of net income (loss)
and comprehensive income (loss).

In determining the carrying amount of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, the Company is required to
estimate the incremental borrowing rate specific to each leased asset or portfolio of leased assets if the interest
rate implicit in the lease is not readily determined. The management determines the incremental borrowing rate
of each leased asset by incorporating the Company’s creditworthiness, the security, term and value of the
underlying leased asset, and the economic environment in which the leased asset operates. The incremental
borrowing rates are subject to change mainly due to macroeconomic changes in the environment.

**Leases (IAS 17)**

A lease is classified at the inception date as a finance lease or an operating lease. A lease that transfers
substantially all of the benefits and risks incidental to the ownership of property is classified as a finance lease.

Finance leases are capitalized at the commencement of the lease at the fair value of the leased property as at
the inception date or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are
apportioned between finance charges and the reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of
interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are recognized in finance costs in the
consolidated statements of net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss).

A leased asset is depreciated over the useful life of the asset. However, if there is no reasonable certainty that
the Company will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset is depreciated over the shorter of the
estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term.

An operating lease is a lease other than a finance lease. Operating lease payments are recognized as an
operating expense in the consolidated statements of net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) on a
straight-line basis over the lease term.

**Warrants**

Financial instruments issued by the Company are classified as equity only to the extent they do not meet the
definition of a financial liability or financial asset. The Company has issued warrants that are convertible into
common stock; these warrants are classified as equity instruments.

**Restricted share units**

Restricted share units (RSUs) are issued in accordance with the Company’s RSU Plan, which entitles a holder
of one RSU to receive one common share of the Company. RSUs are assigned a value based on the market
value of the common shares of the Company on the grant date (or the nearest working day prior to the grant
date). Such value is classified as stock-based compensation over the vesting period for all RSUs awarded to
employees or the Board (note 13). For RSUs awarded to non-employees for equity issuance services, the
value of the RSUs is classified as equity issuance costs on vesting of such RSUs. For RSUs awarded to non

-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
**December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018**

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

employees for business services, the RSU expense would be recognized in the consolidated statements of net
income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) on vesting of such RSUs.

**Stock-based compensation**

The Company’s stock-based compensation consists of stock options, which are described in note 16 and
RSUs, which are discussed in note 13. Each tranche of a share option award is considered a separate award
with its own vesting period and recorded at fair value on the date of grant. The fair value of each tranche is
measured at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Compensation expense is
recognized over the tranche’s vesting period based on the number of awards expected to vest by increasing
contributed surplus. Any consideration paid by employees or directors on the exercise of stock options is
credited to common stock and the related fair value of those stock options is transferred from the contributed
surplus to common stock.

**Business combinations**

The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition accounting method. The total purchase
price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on fair values as at the date of
acquisition. Goodwill as at the acquisition date is measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration
transferred and the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquired company over the net of the
acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Any non-controlling
interests in the acquired company are measured at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the
identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business. Best estimates and assumptions are used in the
purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the business
combination date. These estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a
result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the business combination date, the
Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset
to goodwill. On conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or
liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in the consolidated
statements of net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) in the period in which the adjustments were
determined.

**Changes in non-controlling interests**

The Company treats transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in a loss of control as
transactions with equity owners of the Company. A change in ownership interest results in an adjustment
between the carrying amounts of the controlling and non-controlling interests to reflect their relative interests in
the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount of the adjustment to non-controlling interests and any
consideration paid or received is recognized in a reserve within equity attributable to owners of Akumin.

**Provisions**

Provisions are recognized when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past
events, it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the
amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are measured based on management’s best estimate of the


-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
**December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018**

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

expenditure required to settle the obligation at the end of the reporting period, and are discounted to their
present value where the effect is material.

**Contingencies**

Contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will be confirmed only on the occurrence or nonoccurrence of uncertain future events outside the Company’s control, or present obligations that are not
recognized because it is not probable that an outflow of economic benefits would be required to settle the
obligation or the amount cannot be measured reliably.

Contingent liabilities are not recognized but are disclosed and described in note 15 to the consolidated financial
statements, including an estimate of their potential financial effect and uncertainties relating to the amount or
timing of any outflow, unless the possibility of settlement is remote. In assessing loss contingencies related to
legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in such
proceedings, the Company, with assistance from its legal counsel, evaluates the perceived merits of any legal
proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to
be sought.

**Uncertainty over income tax treatment**

In June 2017, the IASB issued IFRIC Interpretation 23 - Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatment, (IFRIC 23),
which clarifies application of recognition and measurement requirements in IAS 12 - Income Taxes when there
is uncertainty over income tax treatments. The Company adopted IFRIC 23 as at January 1, 2019, but it does
not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

**Use of estimates**

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the
consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. As additional information becomes available or actual
amounts are determinable, the recorded estimates are revised and reflected in operating results in the period in
which they are determined.

i) Accounts receivable and allowance for credit losses

Accounts receivable are recognized initially at net realizable value and are subsequently measured at
amortized cost less loss allowances. During the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company
applied the simplified approach to measure expected credit losses, permitted by IFRS 9, which uses a
lifetime expected loss allowance for all accounts receivable.

Accounts receivable are considered to be in default when customers have failed to make the contractually
required payments when due. A provision for credit losses is recorded as a reduction in revenue with an
offsetting amount recorded as an allowance for credit losses, reducing the carrying value of the receivable.


-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
**December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018**

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

When a receivable is considered uncollectible, the receivable is written off against the allowance for credit
losses account.

ii) Impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets

Management tests at least annually or more frequently if there are events or changes in circumstances to
assess whether goodwill suffered any impairment. Property and equipment are reviewed for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An
impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and
value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which
there are separately identifiable cash flows.

Management makes key assumptions and estimates in determining the recoverable amount from CGUs or
groups of CGUs, including future cash flows based on historical and budgeted operating results, growth
rates, tax rates and appropriate after-tax discount rates.

The Company evaluates its long-lived assets (property and equipment) and intangible assets, other than
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist.
The accounting standards require that if the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows from a
long-lived asset or definite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value of that asset, an asset
impairment charge must be recognized. The amount of the impairment charge is calculated as the excess
of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value, which generally represents the discounted future cash
flows from that asset.

iii) Income taxes

The Company is subject to government audits and the outcome of such audits may differ from original
estimates. Management believes a sufficient amount has been accrued for income taxes. Further,
management evaluates the realizability of the net deferred tax assets and assesses the valuation
allowance periodically. If future taxable income or other factors are not consistent with the Company’s
expectations, an adjustment to its allowance for net deferred tax assets may be required. For net deferred
tax assets, the Company considers estimates of future taxable income, including tax planning strategies,
in determining whether net deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized.

iv) Business combinations

Significant judgment is required in identifying tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of acquired
businesses, as well as determining their fair values. The Company applies the acquisition method to
account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the
fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the
equity interests issued by the Company. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset
or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities
and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at


-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
**December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018**

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

the acquisition date. The Company recognizes any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at its
proportionate share of the fair value of the recognized amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.

v) Contractual allowances

Net patient service revenue is reported at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients, third party
payors, and others for services rendered and recognized in the period in which the services are
performed. Net patient service revenue is recorded based on established billing rates, less estimated
discounts for contractual allowances, principally for patients covered by managed care and other health
plans, and self-pay patients. Contractual adjustments result from the differences between the established
rates charged for services performed and expected reimbursements by government sponsored healthcare programs, insurance companies and other payors for such services.

###### 3 Business combinations

**a)** On April 1, 2019, the Company acquired, through a subsidiary, a single outpatient diagnostic imaging
centre in Davie, Florida, for cash consideration of $450,000 (Davie Acquisition). In accordance with the
transaction agreement, $50,000 of this purchase price (Holdback Fund) was withheld as security for
indemnity obligations and was released to the seller on October 1, 2019. The Company has made a
preliminary fair value determination of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities as at the date of
acquisition, as follows:

**$**

Assets acquired

Non-current assets

Property and equipment 170,000

Real estate (right-of-use) 427,558

Liabilities assumed

Non-current liabilities

Leases 427,558

Net assets acquired 170,000

Goodwill 280,000

Purchase price 450,000

This acquisition was an opportunity for the Company to increase its economies of scale across Florida.
The goodwill assessed on acquisition, expected to be deductible for income tax purposes, reflects the
Company’s expectation of future benefits from the acquired business and workforce, and potential
synergies from cost savings. The results of operations of this acquisition have been included in the
Company’s consolidated statements of net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) from the
acquisition date. Since the acquisition date, this acquisition contributed revenue of approximately $0.4
million and loss before tax of approximately $50 thousand to the Company’s consolidated results for the
twelve months ended December 31, 2019.

The Company has estimated the contribution to the Company’s consolidated results from this acquisition
had the business combination occurred at the beginning of the year. Had the business combination
occurred at the beginning of fiscal 2019, this business combination would have contributed approximately
$0.5 million in revenue and $67 thousand in loss before tax for the twelve months ended December 31,
2019, and consolidated pro forma revenue and income before tax for the same period would have been
approximately $247.6 million and $9.2 million, respectively. These estimates should not be used as an
indicator of past or future performance of the Company or the acquisition.

**b)** On April 15, 2019, the Company announced that it had, through a subsidiary, entered into purchase
agreements to acquire 27 imaging centres (Florida – 21 and Georgia – 6) operated under ADG, The
Imaging Centers of West Palm and Elite Radiology of Georgia. All of these centres were managed by
ADG’s management team. On May 31, 2019, the Company announced the closing of these acquisitions.
Pursuant to the purchase agreements, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding equity
interests of ADG Acquisition Holdings, Inc., TIC Acquisition Holdings, LLC and SFL Radiology Holdings,
LLC (the ADG Acquisitions).

The total purchase price (excluding earn-out) for the ADG Acquisitions at closing (including preliminary
working capital adjustments and payment for cash acquired) was approximately $216 million, of which
$23.4 million was satisfied by the issuance of 6.25 million common shares of the Company at a price of
$3.75 per share based on the share price at the close of May 31, 2019. The balance of this purchase price
was mostly financed through the Term Loans (note 11). A portion of the purchase price payable in respect
of the acquisition of SFL Radiology Holdings, LLC is subject to an earn-out based on annualized revenues
earned in the first two quarters of 2020 less certain costs (note 9). Subsequent to the completion of the
acquisition, the cash purchase price was reduced by approximately $0.2 million due to working capital
adjustments in accordance with the purchase agreement.

The Company has made a preliminary fair value determination of the acquired assets and assumed
liabilities as at the date of acquisition, as follows. Intangible assets include covenant not to compete, trade
name and license arrangements. A deferred tax liability was assumed as part of the net assets acquired in
the ADG Acquisitions.

These acquisitions were an opportunity for the Company to increase its economies of scale across Florida
and enter the Georgia market. The goodwill assessed on acquisition, expected to not be deductible for
income tax purposes, reflects the Company’s expectation of future benefits from the acquired business
and workforce, and potential synergies from cost savings. The results of operations of these acquisitions
have been included in the Company’s consolidated statements of net income (loss) and comprehensive

combination occurred at the beginning of fiscal 2019, this business combination would have contributed
approximately $72.6 million in revenue and $29.3 million in income before tax for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2019, and consolidated pro forma revenue and income before tax for the same period
would have been approximately $277.5 million and $21.4 million, respectively. These estimates should not

The carrying amount of goodwill attributed to each CGU grouping was as follows:

**$**


**2018**

**$**


Florida 255,002,971 49,407,924

Northeast 3,569,801 3,569,801

Other 6,738,521 6,738,521

342,221,551 130,539,869

The recoverable amount from CGUs was estimated based on an assessment of value-in-use. The methodology
used to test impairment is classified as Level 3 per the fair value hierarchy described in note 17.

The value in use for a CGU or group of CGUs is determined by discounting five-year cash flow projections
(cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using perpetuity growth rates). These projections
reflect management’s expectations based on past experience and future estimates of operating performance.
The discount rates are applied to the cash flow projections and are derived from the weighted average cost of
capital for each CGU or group of CGUs.

In measuring the recoverable amounts for goodwill as at December 31, 2019, significant estimates include the
perpetuity growth rates and weighted average cost of capital discount rates, which range from 1.5% to 2.5%
and 8.0% to 9.0% (2018 – 1.5% to 2.5% and 8.0% to 9.0%), respectively. The Company’s discount rates are
based on market rates of return, debt to equity ratios, and certain risk premiums, among other things. The
perpetuity growth rates are based on expected economic conditions and a general outlook for the industry.

An impairment charge is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount. No
impairment charges have arisen as a result of the reviews performed as at October 1, 2019. Reasonably
possible changes in key assumptions would not cause the recoverable amount of goodwill to fall below the
carrying value. As there were no indicators of impairment for any of the CGUs, management has not updated
any of the other impairment calculations as at December 31, 2019.

A portion of the purchase price payable in respect of the ADG Acquisitions (note 3), specifically for SFL
Radiology Holdings, LLC, is subject to an earn-out (the ADG Acquisition – earn-out liability) based on its
annualized revenues earned in the first two quarters of 2020 less certain costs including certain operating
expenses, capital expenditures and incremental working capital. In accordance with the purchase agreement,
50% of this liability is expected to be settled in the latter half of 2020 and the balance in the first half of 2021.

The value of the ADG Acquisition – earn-out liability has been estimated by management using a probability
weighted valuation technique; changes in the fair value of this liability are recognized in the consolidated
statements of net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss). Management estimated the fair value of the
ADG Acquisition – earn-out liability as at May 31, 2019 of approximately $15 million based on a discount rate of
approximately 7% and management’s estimated probability weighted range of the ADG Acquisition – earn-out
liability (it is considered a Level 3 liability as described in note 17). The ADG Acquisition – earn-out liability was
revalued at approximately $15 million as at December 31, 2019 and the change in fair value was recognized in
financial instruments revaluation in the consolidated statements of net income (loss) and comprehensive
income (loss). As at December 31, 2019, the range of estimated undiscounted ADG Acquisition – earn-out
liability is between approximately $15 million and $27 million.

**May 2019 Loans**

On May 31, 2019, the Company amended its previous credit agreement dated August 15, 2018 (such amended
credit agreement, the May 2019 Credit Agreement) whereby it increased the size of its credit facilities and
increased the number of syndicated lenders from five to nine financial institutions. Under the terms of the May
2019 Credit Agreement, the Company received a term loan A and term loan B (Term Loan A, Term Loan B and
collectively, Term Loans) of $66,000,000 and $266,000,000, respectively (face value) and a revolving credit
facility of $50,000,000, of which $3,300,000 was utilized as at May 31, 2019 (the May 2019 Revolving Facility,
and together with the Term Loans, the May 2019 Loans). $16 million of the Term Loan A was subject to a
delayed draw, which was drawn (in addition to approximately $1.3 million under the May 2019 Revolving
Facility) by the Company in October 2019 to partly finance the West Palm Beach Acquisition (note 3). The term
of the May 2019 Loans is five years. The May 2019 Loans can be increased by an additional $100,000,000
subject to certain conditions. The proceeds of the Term Loans were used to settle the Syndicated Loans for
$112,482,181, the principal outstanding under Subordinated Note and related accrued and unpaid interest for
$1,596,250 (note 12), partly finance the ADG Acquisitions and Deltona Acquisition in May 2019 and pay related
debt issuance costs. On May 31, 2019, management determined the fair value of the May 2019 Loans to be
their face value of $319,300,000 net of debt issuance costs of approximately $14.8 million. The fair value of the
May 2019 Loans was determined based on management’s estimation of assumptions that market participants
would use in pricing similar liabilities (it is considered a Level 3 liability as described in note 17).

In August 2019, the Company used $11 million from the May 2019 Revolving Facility to finance the El Paso
Acquisition (note 3) and in December 2019, the Company used $3.2 million from the May 2019 Revolving
Facility to finance two small acquisitions undertaken in January 2020 in Florida and Illinois (note 24). As at
December 31, 2019, this credit facility had a balance of approximately, $22.1 million.

Effective November 14, 2018, the Company entered into a derivative financial instrument contract with a
financial institution in order to mitigate interest rate risk under the variable interest rate Syndicated Loans. The
derivative financial instrument is an interest rate cap rate of 3.75% (LIBOR) per annum on a notional amount of
50% of the face value of the Syndicated Term Loan ($50,000,000 as at November 14, 2018). The termination
date of this arrangement is August 31, 2021. The cost of this derivative financial instrument was $155,000. The
Company has not designated this interest rate cap agreement as a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes.
The fair value of this derivative as determined by the financial institution as at December 31, 2019 represented
an asset to the Company of $597.

In addition, effective July 31, 2019, the Company entered into a derivative financial instrument, an interest rate
collar contract (further amended on November 22, 2019), with a financial institution in order to mitigate interest
rate risk under the variable interest rate Term Loans. This derivative financial instrument has an underlying
notional amount of 100% of the face value of Term Loan B ($266,000,000 as at July 31, 2019) with (i) a cap
rate of 3.00% (LIBOR) per annum and a termination date of July 31, 2022, and (ii) a floor rate of 1.4825%
(LIBOR) per annum and a termination date of October 31, 2021. There was no upfront cost of this derivative
financial instrument. The Company has not designated this interest rate cap agreement as a cash flow hedge
for accounting purposes. The fair value of this derivative as determined by the financial institution as at
December 31, 2019 represented a liability to the Company of $951,702. During February 2020, the Company
amended this interest rate collar contract by reducing the floor rate to 1.1475% (LIBOR) and extending the
termination date to July 31, 2022.

Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in the consolidated statements of net income
(loss) and comprehensive income (loss).

The May 2019 Credit Agreement provides for the following (capitalized terms used below in this note and not
defined elsewhere in these notes have the respective meanings given to them in the May 2019 Credit
Agreement):

Agreement include, among others, failure to pay principal of or interest on any May 2019 Loans when
due, failure to pay any fee or other amount due within two days after the same comes due, failure of
any loan party to comply with any covenants or agreements in the loan documents (subject to
applicable grace periods and/or notice requirements), a representation or warranty contained in the
loan documents is incorrect or misleading when made, events of bankruptcy and a change of control.

**Syndicated Loans**

The Company entered into a credit agreement dated August 15, 2018 (the Syndicated Credit Agreement) with
a syndicate of five financial institutions. Under the terms of the Syndicated Credit Agreement, the Company
received a term loan (Syndicated Term Loan) of $100,000,000 (face value) and a revolving credit facility of
$30,000,000, of which $11,900,000 was utilized as at May 30, 2019 (the Syndicated Revolving Facility, and
together with the Syndicated Term Loan, the Syndicated Loans). The Syndicated Loans could be increased by
an additional $40,000,000 subject to certain conditions. The Company used $11,900,000 of the Syndicated
Revolving Facility to partly finance the Broward Acquisition and the Kissimmee Acquisition during the three

Akumin’s previous senior loan for $74,634,848, finance the Rose Acquisition in August 2018 and pay related
debt issuance costs. Management determined the fair value of the Syndicated Term Loan to be its face value of
$100,000,000, net of debt issuance costs of approximately $2.2 million. The fair value of the Syndicated Loans
was determined based on management’s estimation of assumptions that market participants would use in
pricing similar liabilities (it is considered a Level 3 liability as described in note 17).

In accordance with the terms of the Syndicated Loans, the Company used part of the proceeds of the Term
Loans to settle the Syndicated Loans on May 31, 2019 for $112,482,181 (face value of $111,900,000 and

184,485 1,661,875

As part of the Tampa Acquisition, Akumin FL entered into a subordinated 6% note and security agreement with
the seller’s secured lender on May 11, 2018 (the Subordinated Note and Subordinated Note Lender,
respectively) with a face value of $1,500,000 and a term of four years. The Subordinated Note was recognized
at fair value of $1,490,932 on May 11, 2018 using an effective interest rate. The fair value was determined
based on management’s estimation of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing similar
liabilities (it is considered a Level 3 liability as described in note 17).

In accordance with the terms of the Subordinated Note, the Company used part of the proceeds of the Term
Loans to settle the principal outstanding under the Subordinated Note on May 31, 2019, together with accrued

also recorded a fair value loss of $6,830 on the extinguishment of the Subordinated Note, which was reflected
in the consolidated statements of net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss).

The value of Subordinated Note – Earn-out has been estimated by management using a probabilityweighted valuation technique; changes in the fair value of this liability are recognized in the consolidated
statements of net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss). Management estimated the fair value
of Subordinated Note – Earn-out as at May 11, 2018 of $160,790 based on a discount rate of 8.75% and
management’s estimated probability-weighted range of Subordinated Note – Earn-out Revenue during the
Subordinated Note – Earn-out Period (it is considered a Level 3 liability as described in note 17). The
Subordinated Note – Earn-out was revalued at $184,485 as at December 31, 2019 and the change in fair
value was recognized in financial instruments revaluation in the consolidated statements of net income
(loss) and comprehensive income (loss). As at December 31, 2019, the range of estimated undiscounted
Subordinated Note – Earn-out payable is between $nil and $218,183.

a) During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the following equity issuances occurred at the

Company:

230,000 RSUs were granted to certain employees of the Company on January 1, 2018. Subsequently,

on March 12, 2018 to certain employees of the Company. Each granted RSU entitles the holder to one
common share of the Company. These RSUs will vest as follows: 50% on the first anniversary of the
date of grant and 50% on the second anniversary of the date of grant. RSUs are valued based on the
market value of the common shares of the Company on the grant date (or the nearest working day
prior to the grant date). Such value is classified as stock-based compensation over the vesting period
for all RSUs awarded to employees or the Board.

b) During the three months ended June 30, 2018, the following equity issuances occurred at the

Company:

i) The Company had 238,859 warrants that were due to expire on April 21, 2018 and 112,706

expiry.

ii) On May 2, 2018, the Company completed a bought deal offering of its common shares by way of

short form prospectus sale in each of the provinces of Canada, other than Quebec. A total of
8,750,000 common shares of the Company were sold at a price of $4.00 per common share, for
gross proceeds of $35,000,000 (the Offering). The related issuance costs were approximately
$1.8 million, which were deducted from common equity. The Offering was underwritten by a
syndicate of underwriters (the Underwriters). The Underwriters were granted 525,000 broker
warrants (Broker Warrants) in connection with the Offering, each such Broker Warrant entitling the
holder to acquire one common share of the Company at a price of $4.00 per common share for a
24-month period following the closing of the Offering. The fair value of these warrants, recognized
as a deduction of issued capital, was determined to be $1.3988 per warrant using the BlackScholes option pricing model based on the following assumptions: historical common share price
volatility of approximately 62%; remaining life of two years; price per common share on grant of
warrants of $4.00; expected dividend yield of zero; and annual risk free interest rate of 1.93%.

iii) On May 24, 2018, the Company announced that PMI completed its previously announced

acquisitions of all of the outstanding non-controlling interests in seven of its existing Texas based
diagnostic imaging centres (the Acquisitions). The Acquisitions related to certain operations carried

aggregate cash payment of approximately $17.9 million and the issuance of approximately
$3.7 million in common shares of the Company (927,397 shares at $4.00 per share). The cash

The Company’s effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 30.21% (2018 – (-43.95%)).
The tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in the United States and the relative amounts
of income earned in this jurisdiction, which management expects to be fairly consistent in the near term. It
is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year but are not consistent from year to year.
The following items had the most significant impact on the difference between the statutory rate of 26.5%
(2018 – 26.5%) and the effective tax rate for 2019:

i) a $1,738,508 (-18.81%) (2018 – $(4,591,823) (-132.20%)) decrease resulting from the release of
unrecognized tax benefit;

ii) a $942,013 (10.19%) (2018 – $1,511,135 (43.51%)) increase resulting from the stock-based
compensation (note 16);

iii) a $277,482 (-3.00%) (2018 – $(220,389) (-6.35%)) decrease resulting from tax rate differences
between Canada and the United States; and

iv) a $219,538 increase (2.37%) (2018 - $173,136)(4.98%) increase resulting from state franchise tax,
net of federal tax benefit.

taxable income will be generated to permit use of the existing deferred tax assets. Based on
management’s assessment of the future profitability of the Company, as at December 31, 2019, an
unrecognized tax benefit of $(2,800,607) (2018– $1,796,113) has been recorded to recognize only the
portion of the deferred tax asset that is more likely than not to be realized. The amount of the deferred tax
asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the
carry-forward period are reduced or increased.

**c)** **Tax losses**

The Company has operating loss carry-forwards of $16,226,326 (2018 – $24,436,645), which begin to
expire in 2036. Of these loss-carryforwards, $3,815,178 does not expire but is subject to utilization
restrictions.

###### 15 Commitments and contingencies

The Company is party to various legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and
investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business. With respect to these matters, the management
evaluates the developments on a regular basis and accrues a liability when it believes a loss is probable and
the amount can be reasonably estimated. We believe that the amount or any estimable range of reasonably
possible or probable loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our
business and consolidated financial statements. However, the outcome of these matters is inherently uncertain.
Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against the Company for amounts in excess of
management's expectations, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting
period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected.

###### 16 Stock-based compensation – options

The Company operates an equity-settled, stock options based payment compensation plan, under which the
Company pays equity instruments of the Company as consideration in exchange for employee services. The
plan is open to directors and certain employees of the Company. The fair value of the grant of options is
recognized in the consolidated statements of net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) as an
expense. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted.
The total expense is recognized over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the service
vesting conditions are to be satisfied. The maximum number of common shares reserved for issuance, in the
aggregate, under the Company’s option plan (and under any other share compensation arrangements of the
Company) is 10% of the aggregate number of common shares which are outstanding from time to time. As at
December 31, 2019, this represented 6,984,092 (2018 – 6,237,127) common shares.

During the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, the Company granted 2,188,000 stock options on
November 16, 2018, to purchase common shares on a 1:1 basis with an exercise price of $3.74 per share. The
aggregate fair value of the stock options granted during 2018 was determined to be $3,211,765 (2017– $nil).
These options will vest over a three-year period from the date of issue (34%, 33% and 33% per year,
respectively) and have an expiry date of seven years from the date of issue.

During the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, the Company granted 1,664,852 stock options on
November 18, 2019, to purchase common shares on a 1:1 basis with an exercise price of $3.29 per share. The
aggregate fair value of the stock options granted during 2019 was determined to be $2,391,393 (2018 –
$3,211,765). These options will vest over a three-year period from the date of issue (34%, 33% and 33% per
year, respectively) and have an expiry date of seven years from the date of issue.

The weighted average contractual life of the outstanding options as at December 31, 2019 was approximately,
6.4 years (2018– 7.0 years). The total number of stock options exercisable as at December 31, 2019 was
2,735,188 (2018 – 1,356,929). The total fair value of stock options that vested during the twelve months ended
December 31, 2019 was $1,748,958 (2018 – $706,866).

The fair value of the stock options granted during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was estimated
to be $1.4364 per option using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on the following assumptions:
historical common share price volatility of 40%; remaining life of seven years; expected dividend yield of nil;
and an annual risk free interest rate of 1.48%. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, the
Company recorded a total stock-based options compensation expense of approximately $1,995,347 (2018 –
$681,412). The total compensation cost related to unvested options awards not yet recognized is approximately
$3,185,813 (2018 – $2,936,556) and will be recognized over a remaining vesting period of 2.88 years (2018 –
2.88 years).

###### 17 Risk management arising from financial instruments

In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to risks that can affect its operating performance.
These risks, and the actions taken to manage them, are as follows:

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

**Fair value**

The carrying value of cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued liabilities and leases
approximates their fair value given their short-term nature.

The carrying value of the non-current portion of leases approximates their fair value given the difference
between the discount rates used to recognize the liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and the market
rates of interest is insignificant. The estimated fair values of other non-current assets and liabilities were as
follows:


**2019**

**$**


**2018**

**$**


Loans to related parties   - 495,000

Syndicated loans payable   - 110,244,000

May 2019 loans payable 360,596,500   
Wesley Chapel Loan payable 1,483,830 1,823,000

Subordinated notes payable   - 1,476,000

Subordinated notes – earn-out 184,485 169,642

ADG Acquisition – earn-out 14,834,067   
Derivative financial instruments 951,105 (16,014)

378,049,987 113,696,628

Financial instruments recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets are classified using a fair value
hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements. The fair value hierarchy
has the following levels:

- Level 1

Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Pricing inputs are
based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the
ability to access at the measurement date. For securities, the valuations are based on quoted prices of the
securities that are readily and regularly available in an active market, and accordingly, a significant degree
of judgment is not required. As at December 31, 2019, the Company did not have any financial assets or
liabilities subsequently measured at fair value under the Level 1 category.

- Level 2

Pricing inputs are based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for
identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model based valuation techniques for
which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable
market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. The estimated fair value of the
liabilities that are recognized at fair value, and subsequently measured at amortized cost, are determined


-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
**December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018**

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

using Level 2 inputs primarily related to comparable market prices. As at December 31, 2019, the
derivative financial instruments were measured at fair value under the Level 2 category on recognition.
The derivative financial instruments are subsequently remeasured at fair value under the Level 2 category.

   - Level 3

Pricing inputs are generally unobservable for the assets or liabilities and include situations where there is
little, if any, market activity for the investment. The inputs into the determination of fair value require
management’s judgment or estimation of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the
assets or liabilities. The fair values are therefore determined using model based techniques that include
option pricing models, discounted cash flow models, and similar techniques.

The loans to related parties, the May 2019 Loans, the Syndicated Loans, Wesley Chapel Loan, Subordinated
Notes and Subordinated Notes – Earn-out and ADG Acquisition – Earn-out were measured at fair value under
the Level 3 category on recognition. The Subordinated Notes – Earn-out and ADG Acquisition – Earn-out are
subsequently remeasured at fair value under the Level 3 category.

There were no significant transfers between levels during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and
2018.

Financial instruments are classified into one of the following categories: amortized cost, fair value through profit
or loss and fair value through other comprehensive income.

The following table summarizes information regarding the carrying value of the Company’s financial
instruments:

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
**December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018**

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

**Credit risk**

Credit risk arises from the potential a counterparty will fail to perform its obligations. The Company is exposed
to credit risk from customers. The Company grants credit to its customers in the normal course of business.
The consolidated financial statements take into account an allowance for bad debts. The Company is exposed
to credit risk from its customers but the concentration of the risk is minimized because of the large customer
base and its dispersion across different payers. During the year, the Company may have deposits with financial
institutions that exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits. As at December 31, 2019, the Company
had cash of $23,388,916 (2018 – $19,326,412) and accounts receivable of $82,867,225 (2018 – $29,810,501).

Collectibility of the receivables is reviewed regularly and an allowance based on lifetime expected credit losses
is established as necessary. Current economic conditions and historical collection experience are considered
when determining whether to make an allowance. The same factors are considered when determining whether
to write off amounts charged to the allowance for credit losses. The aging of these receivables, net of
allowances, is as follows:


**2019**

**2018**

Accounts receivable

0 – 90 days 32,552,836 11,940,989

More than 180 days 31,208,028 11,146,745

82,867,225 29,810,501

The activity of the allowance for credit losses for the period is as follows:


**2019**

**2018**

Allowance – Beginning of period 8,473,764 4,553,094

Writeoffs (3,341,105) (2,760,040)

Allowance – End of period 16,897,633 8,473,764

**Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk is the risk the Company may encounter difficulty in raising funds to meet its financial
commitments. The Company is exposed to liquidity risk mainly with respect to the Senior Loans. The Company
ensures there is sufficient liquidity to meet its short-term business requirements, taking into account its
anticipated cash flows from operations and its holdings of cash.

**Currency risk**

Currency risk is the risk to the Company’s earnings that arises from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and
the degree of volatility of those rates. In the normal course of business, the Company may enter into foreign


-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
**December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018**

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

exchange contracts with financial institutions to hedge the value of foreign currency denominated assets. Gains
and losses arising from these contracts offset the losses and gains from the underlying hedged transactions. As
at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company did not enter into any foreign exchange contracts
that would expose the Company to currency risk.

**Interest rate risk**

Interest rate risk is the risk the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of
changes in market interest rates. Changes in lending rates can cause fluctuations in interest payments and
cash flows. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments to alter the effects of this risk, except as
noted in note 11. The Company is partly financed through May 2019 Loans, which bear interest at rates tied to
the one-month LIBOR.

Variable interest rates on the Company’s debts are as follows:

May 2019 Loans one-month LIBOR plus Applicable Rate

The following table shows the Company’s exposure to interest rate risk and the effects on comprehensive
income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 of a 1% increase or decrease in the

###### 24 New standards, amendments and interpretations not yet adopted by the Company

A number of new standards, amendments and interpretations to standards are effective for annual periods
beginning on or after January 1, 2020 and have not been early adopted by the Company. Those which may be
relevant to the Company in future reporting periods and on foreseeable future transactions are set out below.

Definition of a Business – Amendments to IFRS 3: The amended definition of a business requires an
acquisition to include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to
create outputs. The definition of the term ‘outputs’ is amended to focus on goods and services provided to
customers, generating investment income and other income, and it excludes returns in the form of lower costs
and other economic benefits. The amendments will likely result in more acquisitions being accounted for as
asset acquisitions as opposed to business combinations.

Definition of Material – Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8: The IASB has made amendments to IAS 1,
Presentation of Financial Statements ("IAS 1") and IAS 8, Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting
Estimates and Errors to use a consistent definition of materiality throughout IFRS and the Conceptual
Framework for Financial Reporting, and clarify when information is material and incorporate some of the
guidance in IAS 1 about immaterial information.

The Company intends to adopt these amendments in its consolidated financial statements for the annual period
beginning on January 1, 2020.

###### 25 Subsequent events

**a)** On January 1, 2020, the Company acquired, through its subsidiaries, one outpatient diagnostic imaging

centre in Coral Springs, Florida and one outpatient diagnostic imaging centre in Crystal Lake, Illinois, for
cash consideration of approximately $3.3 million.

These acquisitions were mostly financed through borrowing $3.2 million in December 2019 from the

Company’s revolving credit facility under the May 2019 Credit Agreement. The Company continues to
evaluate the purchase price allocation related to these acquisitions.

**b)** As at December 31, 2019, the Company had 337,500 RSUs outstanding. All of these RSUs vested

between January 1, 2020 and March 12, 2020. 285,000 of these RSUs were settled for common shares on
March 12, 2020 in accordance with the terms of the RSU Plan.

**c)** Subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2019, a pandemic relating to a novel coronavirus known as

COVID-19 occurred causing significant financial market disruption and social dislocation. The pandemic is
dynamic with various cities, counties, states and countries around the world responding in different ways to
address and contain the outbreak, including the declaration of a global pandemic by the World Health
Organization, a National State of Emergency in the United States and state and local executive orders and
ordinances forcing the closure of non essential businesses and persons not employed in or using essential
services to “stay at home” or “shelter in place”. At this stage, we have no certainty as to how long the


-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
**December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018**

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

pandemic, or a more limited epidemic, will last, what regions will be most effected or to what extent
containment measures will be applied.

Imaging centers are healthcare facilities and as such are generally considered an essential service and
expected to continue to operate during any epidemic or pandemic. However, there is potential that actions
taken by government, or individual actions, in response to containment or avoidance of this coronavirus
could impact a patient’s ability or decision to seek imaging services at a given time which could have a
significant impact on volume at our imaging centers leading to temporary or prolonged staff layoffs,
reduced hours, closures and other cost containment efforts. Further, there is potential that certain services
which are not urgent and can be deferred without significant harm to a patient’s health may be delayed,
either by the Company in response to local laws or good public health practice or voluntarily by the patient.
In addition, there is potential that the outbreak of the coronavirus could impact supply chains, including the
Company’s supply of personal protective equipment, and lead to personnel shortages, each of which could
impact the ability of the Company to safely perform imaging services. It is also possible that social
distancing efforts and sanitization and decontamination procedures could cause delays in the performance
of imaging services.

###### Notice to Reader

**Re: Akumin Inc.**

Please be advised that the audited consolidated financial statements of Akumin Inc. as at and for the year
ended December 31, 2018 were corrected for an error relating to the classification of cash flows.

As described in note 13, during 2018 the Company acquired all of the outstanding non-controlling
interests in seven of its existing Texas based diagnostic imaging centres. Previously, the “Acquisition of
non-controlling interests” line was incorrectly presented under the Investing activities category instead of
the Financing activities category within the consolidated statements of cash flow for the year ended
December 31, 2018.

The error did not impact the consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive income (loss) or changes in equity. Operating cash flow and increase in cash during the
period were not impacted. Basic and diluted earnings per share were not impacted.

#### Independent auditor’s report

To the Shareholders of Akumin Inc.

###### Our opinion

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Akumin Inc. and its subsidiaries (together, the Company) as at December 31, 2018
and 2017, and its financial performance and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2018 and the
fifteen-month period ended December 31, 2017 in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IFRS).

**What we have audited**
The Company’s consolidated financial statements comprise:

- the consolidated balance sheets as at December 31, 2018 and 2017;

- the consolidated statements of net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) for the year
ended December 31, 2018 and the fifteen-month period ended December 31, 2017;

- the consolidated statements of changes in equity for the year ended December 31, 2018 and the
fifteen-month period ended December 31, 2017;

- the consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2018 and the fifteenmonth period ended December 31, 2017; and

- the notes to the consolidated financial statements, which include a summary of significant
accounting policies.

###### Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards. Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit
_of the consolidated financial statements section of our report._

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
opinion.

**Independence**
We are independent of the Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our
audit of the consolidated financial statements in Canada. We have fulfilled our other ethical
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

###### Emphasis of matter

We draw attention to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, which explains that the consolidated
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 has been restated from those on which we
originally reported on March 28, 2019. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

###### Other information

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Management’s
Discussion and Analysis.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the
other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially
inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or
otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other
information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

###### Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the consolidated financial statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial
statements in accordance with IFRS, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary
to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate
the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.

###### Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as
a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s
report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee
that an audit conducted in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards will always
detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards, we exercise
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and
obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk
of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the
override of internal control.


-----

- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control.

- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by management.

- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and,
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s
report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are
inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to
the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to
cease to continue as a going concern.

- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the
underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or
business activities within the Company to express an opinion on the consolidated financial
statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.
We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal
control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant
ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related
safeguards.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Jennifer Psutka.

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
**December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017**

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

###### 1 Presentation of consolidated financial statements and nature of operations

The operations of Akumin Inc. (Akumin or the Company) and its Subsidiaries (defined below) primarily consist
of operating outpatient diagnostic imaging centres located in Florida, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Texas, Illinois
and Kansas. Substantially all of the centres operated by Akumin were obtained through acquisition. Related to
its imaging centre operations, Akumin also operates a medical equipment business, SyncMed, LLC, which
provides maintenance services to Akumin’s imaging centres in Texas, Illinois and Kansas and a billing and
revenue cycle management business, Rev Flo, Inc., whose operations were merged into Akumin’s wholly owned
subsidiary, Akumin Corp. on December 31, 2018.

The services offered by the Company (through the Subsidiaries) include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), nuclear medicine, mammography,
ultrasound, digital radiography (X-ray), fluoroscopy and other related procedures.

The Company has a diverse mix of payers, including private, managed care capitated and government payers.

The registered and head office of Akumin is located at 151 Bloor Street West, Suite 603, Toronto, Ontario,
M5S 1S4. All operating activities are conducted through its wholly owned US subsidiary, Akumin Holdings
Corp. and the wholly owned subsidiaries of Akumin Holdings Corp., namely, Akumin Corp., Akumin Florida
Holdings, LLC, formerly known as Tri-State Imaging FL Holdings, LLC (FL Holdings), Akumin Imaging Texas,
LLC, formerly known as Preferred Medical Imaging, LLC (PMI), SyncMed and Akumin FL, LLC (Akumin FL)
(collectively, the Subsidiaries), all of which are located in the United States.

###### 2 Summary of significant accounting policies

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).

The significant accounting policies described below have been applied consistently to all periods presented.
Certain comparative information has been reclassified to conform with the presentation adopted in the current
fiscal period.

During September 2017, the Company changed its reporting year-end from September 30 to December 31. As a
result, during the transitional year, the consolidated financial statements were presented for the fifteen-month
period ended December 31, 2017.

These consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors (the Board) and authorized
for issue by the Board on November 13, 2019.

**Basis of presentation**

The consolidated financial statements include all of the accounts of the Company and the Subsidiaries. All
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated on consolidation.

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
**December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017**

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

**Functional and reporting currency and foreign currency translation**

The functional and reporting currency of the Company and the Subsidiaries is US dollars. Monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into US dollars at the rates of exchange prevailing at
the consolidated balance sheet dates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at rates prevailing at
the dates of acquisition. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average rate of exchange in effect during
the month the transaction occurred. All exchange gains and losses are recognized in the current year’s earnings.

**Cash**

Cash includes cash on hand and cash held with banks.

**Property and equipment**

Property and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the
declining balance method, unless stated otherwise, as follows:

Medical equipment and equipment under finance leases 20%

Computer and office equipment 30%

Furniture and fittings 15%

Leasehold improvements straight-line over

term of lease

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Operating lease buyouts and
significant upgrades are capitalized.

**Intangible assets**

The Company classifies intangible assets, obtained through acquisitions or developed internally, as definite
lived. Intangible assets consist of software costs, trade name and covenants not to compete; these intangible
assets are recorded at cost and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, using the declining balance
method, unless stated otherwise, as follows:

Software costs and trade name 20%

Covenant not to compete straight-line over

term of contract

The Company reviews the appropriateness of the amortization period related to the definite lived intangible
assets annually.

**Goodwill**

Goodwill is recognized as the fair value of the consideration transferred, less the fair value of the net identifiable
assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as at the acquisition date. Subsequent to initial recognition, goodwill is
measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill acquired in business combinations is allocated
to groups of cash generating units (CGUs) that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
The determination of CGUs and the level at which goodwill is monitored requires judgment by management.
The Company’s CGUs generally represent individual business units below the level of the Company’s operating

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
**December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017**

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

segment. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment as at October 1 by comparing the carrying value of the
CGUs against the recoverable amount (higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell).

**Impairment of long-lived assets**

The Company assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that a long-lived asset may be
impaired. If any indication exists, the Company estimates the recoverable amount. For the purpose of
impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of
assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other
CGUs. The recoverable amount of an asset or a CGU is the higher of its fair value, less costs to sell, and its value
in use.

Fair value less costs to sell is the amount obtainable from the sale of an asset or CGU in an arm’s length
transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties, less the costs to sell. Costs of disposal are incremental costs
directly attributable to the disposal of an asset and income tax expense.

In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the
asset or CGU.

If the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment charge is recognized
immediately in the consolidated statements of net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) by the
amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or CGU exceeds the recoverable amount. Where an
impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is increased to the lesser of the
revised estimate of the recoverable amount, and the carrying amount that would have been recorded had no
impairment loss been recognized previously.

**Segment reporting**

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief
operating decision maker. The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and
assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer. The
Company has one reportable segment, which is outpatient diagnostic imaging services.

**Revenue recognition**

The Company adopted IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (IFRS 15), as at January 1, 2018, with
full retrospective application. Service fee revenue, net of contractual allowances and discounts, consists of net
patient fees received from various payers and patients based mainly on established contractual billing rates, less
allowances for contractual adjustments and discounts and allowances. This service fee revenue is primarily
comprised of fees for the use of the Company’s diagnostic imaging equipment and provision of medical
supplies.

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
**December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017**

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

Service fee revenue is recorded during the period in which the Company’s performance obligations are satisfied,
based on the estimated collectible amounts from the patients and third party payers. The Company’s
performance obligations are satisfied when services are rendered to the patient. Third party payers include
federal and state agencies (under the Medicare and Medicaid programs), managed care health plans,
commercial insurance companies and employers. Estimates of contractual allowances are based on the
payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements. A provision for credit losses is also recorded in
accordance with IFRS 9. The Company regularly attempts to estimate its expected reimbursement for patients
based on the applicable contract terms. The Company believes its review process enables it to identify instances
on a timely basis where such estimates need to be revised.

Other revenue consists of miscellaneous fees under contractual arrangements, including service fee revenue
under capitation arrangements with third party payers, management fees and fees for other services provided to
third parties. Revenue is recorded during the period in which the Company’s performance obligations under the
contract are satisfied by the Company. There was no material impact to other revenue as a result of adopting
IFRS 15.

IFRS 15 applies a single model for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers. It requires revenue to be
recognized in a manner that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to a customer and at an amount
that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring those goods or services. This
is achieved by applying the following five steps:

i) identify the contract with a customer;

ii) identify the performance obligation in the contract;

iii) determine the transaction price;

iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and

v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.

The principal change affecting the Company results from the presentation of variable consideration that under
the accounting standard is included in the transaction price up to an amount that is probable that a significant
reversal will not occur. The most common form of variable consideration the Company experiences relates to
amounts for services provided that are ultimately not realizable from a payer. Under the previous standard, the
Company’s estimate for unrealized amounts was recorded in expenses as a provision for credit losses. Under
IFRS 15, the Company’s estimate for unrealizable amounts is recognized as an adjustment to the transaction
price at the inception of the contract. The net impact of adoption of IFRS 15 for the fifteen months ended
December 31, 2017 is a reduction in service fee revenue of $5,272,485 and a corresponding reduction in
operating expenses of $5,272,485 with no impact to net income. Due to the nature of these adjustments, there
was no impact to the opening retained earnings, consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of
changes in equity or consolidated statements of cash flows.

**December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017**

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

The Company has elected to use the following practical expedients in adopting IFRS 15:

i) the amount of consideration over the contract term has not been adjusted for the effects of a significant
financing component, since at contract inception, the period between when the Company transfers a
promised service to a customer and when the customer pays for that service will generally be one year or
less; and

ii) incremental costs associated with obtaining a contract are recognized as an expense when incurred because
the amortization period of the asset that the Company would have otherwise recognized is generally one
year or less.

**Earnings per share**

Basic earnings per common share (EPS) is calculated by dividing the net earnings available to common
shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is
calculated by adjusting the net earnings available to common shareholders and the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive instruments.

**Income taxes**

Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognized in the consolidated
statements of net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss). Current income tax expense represents the
amount of income taxes payable based on tax law that is enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date,
and is adjusted for changes in estimates of tax expense recognized in prior periods. A current tax liability or
asset is recognized for income taxes payable, or paid but recoverable, in respect of all periods to date.

The Company uses the deferred tax method of accounting for income taxes. Accordingly, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the deferred tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated
financial statements’ carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted or substantively enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the periods in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of
a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the consolidated statements of net
income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) in the period in which the enactment or substantive enactment
occurs. A deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary
differences, to the extent that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be available to utilize
such amounts. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are adjusted to the extent that it is
no longer probable that the related tax benefits will be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset
when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and the Company intends to settle its current
tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

**Financial instruments**

On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted IFRS 9, Financial Instruments (IFRS 9), retrospectively and has
chosen to not restate comparative information in accordance with the transitional provisions in IFRS 9. IFRS 9
addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and liabilities. It establishes three
measurement categories for financial assets: amortized cost, fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) and fair
value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). The basis of classification depends on the entity’s
business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. A new expected credit losses
model replaces the incurred loss impairment model previously used in IAS 39, Financial Instruments –
Recognition and Measurement (IAS 39).

The classification of financial liabilities under IFRS 9 remains broadly the same as under IAS 39. Financial
liabilities are measured at amortized cost unless they are required to be measured at FVTPL or the Company
has opted to measure them at FVTPL.

The Company completed an assessment of its financial assets (cash, accounts receivable and derivative financial
instruments) and financial liabilities (accounts payable and accrued liabilities, loans and finance leases) as at
January 1, 2018. All financial assets or liabilities were classified at amortized cost under IAS 39 and IFRS 9,
except for derivative financial instruments, which were classified at FVTPL under IAS 39 and IFRS 9. There has
been no significant impact for the Company from the adoption of IFRS 9 on the carrying amounts of financial
assets or liabilities as at January 1, 2018. Also, there was no material impact from the transition to IFRS 9 on
the consolidated statements of net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss).

**a)** **Measurement of financial assets and liabilities**

Financial assets and liabilities at amortized cost are initially recognized at fair value, and subsequently are
carried at amortized cost less any impairment. Derivative financial instruments and earn-outs are initially
recognized and subsequently measured at fair value.

**b)** **Impairment of financial assets**

IFRS 9 replaces the incurred loss model in IAS 39 with an expected credit loss (ECL) model. The new
impairment model applies to financial assets measured at amortized cost, contract assets and debt
instruments measured at FVOCI, but not to investments in equity instruments. Under IFRS 9, credit losses
are generally recognized earlier than under IAS 39. On adoption of IFRS 9, the financial assets of the
Company measured at amortized cost consisted of cash, accounts receivable and loans to related parties.

Under IFRS 9, expected credit losses are measured as follows:

      - twelve-month ECL – ECLs that result from possible default events within twelve months after the
reporting date; and

      - lifetime ECLs – ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial
instrument.

(13)


-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
**December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017**

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

The Company measures provision for credit losses at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs, except for the
following, which are measured based on twelve-month ECLs:

      - cash and loans to related parties for which the risk of default occurring over the expected life of the
financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition.

In applying the IFRS 9 impairment requirements, the Company has applied the general approach for cash
and loans to related parties, while the Company has elected to measure provision for credit losses for
accounts receivable at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs using the simplified approach.

In order to assess whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial
recognition and when estimating ECLs, the Company considers reasonable and supportable information
that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes information based on the
Company’s historical experience and other forward-looking information. The maximum period considered
when estimating ECLs is the maximum contractual period over which the Company is exposed to credit
risk.

**c)** **Measurement of ECLs**

ECLs are a probability weighted estimate of provision for credit losses. Provision for credit losses is
measured as the present value of the difference between the cash flows due to the Company in accordance
with the contract and the cash flows the Company expects to receive. ECLs are discounted at the effective
interest rate of the financial asset; however, due to the short-term nature of most of the Company’s
financial assets measured at amortized cost, the time value of money is not expected to be significant in the
calculation of the ECL.

**d)** **Impact of the new impairment model**

The Company has determined that the application of IFRS 9’s impairment requirements as at January 1,
2018 does not result in a significant change in the provision for credit losses recognized by the Company.
For accounts receivable, the Company uses a provision matrix to determine the ECLs based on actual
credit loss experience with consideration of forward-looking information including changes to economic
conditions that would impact its customers.

The Company applied the general approach for loans to related parties, considering any significant
increases in credit risk for such receivables since inception. In determining the ECLs for such receivables,
the Company considered actual credit loss experience with consideration of forward-looking information
including changes to economic conditions that would impact the payers.

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
**December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017**

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

**Leases**

A lease is classified at the inception date as a finance lease or an operating lease. A lease that transfers
substantially all of the benefits and risks incidental to the ownership of property is classified as a finance lease.

Finance leases are capitalized at the commencement of the lease at the fair value of the leased property as at the
inception date or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are
apportioned between finance charges and the reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of
interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are recognized in finance costs in the
consolidated statements of net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss).

A leased asset is depreciated over the useful life of the asset. However, if there is no reasonable certainty that
the Company will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset is depreciated over the shorter of the
estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term.

An operating lease is a lease other than a finance lease. Operating lease payments are recognized as an
operating expense in the consolidated statements of net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) on a
straight-line basis over the lease term.

**Warrants**

Financial instruments issued by the Company are classified as equity only to the extent they do not meet the
definition of a financial liability or financial asset. The Company has issued warrants that are convertible into
common stock; these warrants are classified as equity instruments.

**Restricted share units**

Restricted share units (RSUs) are issued in accordance with the Company’s RSU Plan, which entitles a holder of
one RSU to receive one common share of the Company. RSUs are assigned a value based on the market value of
the common shares of the Company on the grant date (or the nearest working day prior to the grant date). Such
value is classified as stock-based compensation over the vesting period for all RSUs awarded to employees or
the Board (note 13). For RSUs awarded to non-employees for equity issuance services, the value of the RSUs is
classified as equity issuance costs on vesting of such RSUs. For RSUs awarded to non-employees for business
services, the RSU expense would be recognized in the consolidated statements of net income (loss) and
comprehensive income (loss) on vesting of such RSUs.

**Stock-based compensation**

The Company’s primary type of stock-based compensation consists of stock options, which are described in
note 16. The Company uses the fair value method, which includes a volatility assumption, based on a peer group
of companies. Each tranche of a share option award is considered a separate award with its own vesting period
and recorded at fair value on the date of grant. The fair value of each tranche is measured at the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Compensation expense is recognized over the tranche’s vesting
period based on the number of awards expected to vest by increasing contributed surplus. Any consideration

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

paid by employees or directors on the exercise of stock options is credited to common stock and the related fair
value of those stock options is transferred from the contributed surplus to common stock.

**Business combinations**

The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition accounting method. The total purchase
price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on fair values as at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill as at the acquisition date is measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred
and the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquired company over the net of the acquisition date
fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Any non-controlling interests in the
acquired company are measured at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the identifiable assets
and liabilities of the acquired business. Best estimates and assumptions are used in the purchase price
allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the business combination date.
These estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the
measurement period, which may be up to one year from the business combination date, the Company may
record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. On
conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities
assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in the consolidated statements of
net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) in the period in which the adjustments were determined.

**Changes in non-controlling interests**

The Company treats transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in a loss of control as
transactions with equity owners of the Company. A change in ownership interest results in an adjustment
between the carrying amounts of the controlling and non-controlling interests to reflect their relative interests
in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount of the adjustment to non-controlling interests and any
consideration paid or received is recognized in a reserve within equity attributable to owners of Akumin.

**Provisions**

Provisions are recognized when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past
events, it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the
amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are measured based on management’s best estimate of the
expenditure required to settle the obligation at the end of the reporting period, and are discounted to their
present value where the effect is material.

**Contingencies**

Contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will be confirmed only on the occurrence or nonoccurrence of uncertain future events outside the Company’s control, or present obligations that are not
recognized because it is not probable that an outflow of economic benefits would be required to settle the
obligation or the amount cannot be measured reliably.

(16)


-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
**December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017**

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

Contingent liabilities are not recognized but are disclosed and described in note 15 to the consolidated financial
statements, including an estimate of their potential financial effect and uncertainties relating to the amount or
timing of any outflow, unless the possibility of settlement is remote. In assessing loss contingencies related to
legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in such
proceedings, the Company, with assistance from its legal counsel, evaluates the perceived merits of any legal
proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to
be sought.

**Use of estimates**

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the
consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. As additional information becomes available or actual
amounts are determinable, the recorded estimates are revised and reflected in operating results in the period in
which they are determined.

i) Accounts receivable and allowance for credit losses

Accounts receivable are recognized initially at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortized cost
less loss allowances. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company applied the simplified
approach to measure expected credit losses, permitted by IFRS 9, which uses a lifetime expected loss
allowance for all accounts receivable. During the fifteen months ended December 31, 2017, the impairment
for accounts receivable was recorded when there was an expectation that the Company would not be able
to collect all amounts due of the receivable.

Accounts receivable are considered to be in default when customers have failed to make the contractually
required payments when due. A provision for credit losses is recorded as a reduction in revenue with an
offsetting amount recorded as an allowance for credit losses, reducing the carrying value of the receivable.
When a receivable is considered uncollectible, the receivable is written off against the allowance for credit
losses account.

ii) Impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets

Management tests at least annually or more frequently if there are events or changes in circumstances to
assess whether goodwill suffered any impairment. Property and equipment are reviewed for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An
impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable
amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For
the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately
identifiable cash flows.

Management makes key assumptions and estimates in determining the recoverable amount from CGUs or
groups of CGUs, including future cash flows based on historical and budgeted operating results, growth
rates, tax rates and appropriate after-tax discount rates.

(17)


-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
**December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017**

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

The Company evaluates its long-lived assets (property and equipment) and intangible assets, other than
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, for impairment whenever indicators of impairment
exist. The accounting standards require that if the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows
from a long-lived asset or definite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value of that asset, an
asset impairment charge must be recognized. The amount of the impairment charge is calculated as the
excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value, which generally represents the discounted future
cash flows from that asset.

iii) Income taxes

The Company is subject to government audits and the outcome of such audits may differ from original
estimates. Management believes a sufficient amount has been accrued for income taxes. Further,
management evaluates the realizability of the net deferred tax assets and assesses the valuation allowance
periodically. If future taxable income or other factors are not consistent with the Company’s expectations,
an adjustment to its allowance for net deferred tax assets may be required. For net deferred tax assets, the
Company considers estimates of future taxable income, including tax planning strategies, in determining
whether net deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized.

iv) Business combinations

Significant judgment is required in identifying tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of acquired
businesses, as well as determining their fair values. The Company applies the acquisition method to
account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the
fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the
equity interests issued by the Company. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset
or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired and
liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair
values at the acquisition date. The Company recognizes any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at fair
value of the recognized amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.

v) Contractual allowances

Net patient service revenue is reported at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients, third party
payors, and others for services rendered and recognized in the period in which the services are performed.
Net patient service revenue is recorded based on established billing rates, less estimated discounts for
contractual allowances, principally for patients covered by managed care and other health plans, and selfpay patients. Contractual adjustments result from the differences between the established rates charged
for services performed and expected reimbursements by government sponsored health-care programs and
insurance companies for such services.

**Correction of error in statement of cash flows**

Our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2018 has been restated to classify the
cash flows associated with the acquisition of non-controlling interests as a financing cash flow. Previously,
management had incorrectly presented such cash flows as an investing activity. The nature of the transaction
which gave rise to these cash flows is described in note 13. Furthermore, this adjustment does not affect our

###### 3 Business combinations

**a)** On April 5, 2018, the Company announced that, through a subsidiary, it had entered into a management
agreement with the owners of four centres located in one of Akumin’s core geographic markets (the
Managed Centres, and the period from April 5 to May 11, 2018, the Management Period). On May 11,
2018, the Company announced it had acquired, through a subsidiary (Akumin FL), certain assets of the
Managed Centres in Florida (the Tampa Acquisition). The sellers were paid cash consideration of
$50,000. The Company also assumed certain priority ranked accounts payable of $1,553,290 (including
$727,826 related to working capital loans advanced from the Company to the Managed Centres during the
Management Period) and a 6% third party subordinated note with a principal balance of $1.5 million (face
value) and a term of four years. The principal balance of the third party loan is subject to an earn-out of up
to an additional $4.0 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain revenue-based milestones (note 12). The
Company has made a preliminary fair value determination of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities
as follows:

This acquisition was an opportunity for the Company to increase its economies of scale across Florida. The
goodwill assessed on acquisition, expected to be deductible for income tax purposes, reflects the Company’s
expectation of future benefits from the acquired business and workforce, and potential synergies from cost
savings. The results of operations of the Tampa Acquisition have been included in the Company’s
consolidated statements of net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) from the acquisition date.
Since the acquisition date, the Tampa Acquisition contributed revenue of approximately $5.1 million and
net income before tax of approximately $0.8 million to the Company’s consolidated results for the twelve
months ended December 31, 2018.

The Company has estimated the contribution to the Company’s consolidated results from this acquisition
had the business combination occurred at the beginning of the year. Had the business combination
occurred at the beginning of fiscal 2018, this business combination would have contributed approximately
$8.0 million in revenue and $1.2 million in income before tax for the twelve months ended December 31,
2018, and consolidated pro forma revenue and income before tax for the same period would have been
approximately $157.6 million and $6.5 million, respectively. These estimates should not be used as an
indicator of past or future performance of the Company or the acquisition.

**b) On August 15, 2018, the Company announced that, through a subsidiary, it had acquired 11 outpatient**

diagnostic imaging centres in the Tampa Bay Area (the Rose Acquisition) for a cash consideration of
approximately $24.6 million, which was financed through the Syndicated Term Loan (note 10). The
Company has made a preliminary fair value determination of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities as
follows. The intangible assets consist of the trade name and covenants not to compete. The fair value of the
accounts receivable is approximately $1.3 million and it is net of expected credit losses of approximately
4%. Subsequent to the completion of the acquisition the Company, in accordance with the purchase
agreement, prepared a working capital statement as of the closing date and determined a working capital
asset of $323,983 due to the Company.

approximately $166.1 million and $7.4 million, respectively. These estimates should not be used as an
indicator of past or future performance of the Company or the acquisition.

**e) On August 9, 2017, the Company, through a wholly owned subsidiary, completed the acquisition of 100% of**

the outstanding equity interest in Preferred Medical Imaging, LLC pursuant to the August 9, 2017 purchase
agreement with Preferred Medical Holdings, LLC and other sellers. The total purchase price of
approximately, $94 million comprised $74 million of cash consideration and 5,714,285 common shares of
the Company (issued at $3.50 per share with a total value at closing of $20 million). The cash portion of the
purchase price was funded through sale of subscription receipts for gross proceeds of approximately $33
million and additional long-term debt as described in notes 13(b)(i) and 10(ii), respectively. Subsequent to
the completion of the acquisition the Company, in accordance with the purchase agreement, prepared a
working capital statement as of the closing date and determined a working capital liability of $160,733 due
to the sellers.

Acquisition related costs of $4.3 million were charged to the consolidated statements of net loss and
comprehensive loss from the closing date to December 31, 2017. The revenue and profit of PMI from the
closing date to December 31, 2017 are included in the operating results of the existing single business
segment which the Company operates. The Company has made a fair value determination of the acquired
assets and assumed liabilities as follows:

This acquisition was an opportunity for the Company to increase its presence in new states. The goodwill
assessed on acquisition, reflects the Company’s expectation of future benefits from the acquired business
and workforce, and potential synergies from cost savings. Goodwill is not amortized for accounting
purposes, however, it is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. The results of operations of the
Texas Acquisition have been included in the Company’s consolidated statements of net loss and
comprehensive loss from August 9, 2017. Since the acquisition date, the Texas Acquisition contributed
revenue of approximately $27.3 million and income before tax and non-controlling interests of
approximately $8.7 million to the Company’s consolidated results for the fifteen months ended
December 31, 2017.

The Company has estimated the contribution to the Company’s consolidated results from this acquisition
had the business combination occurred at the beginning of the year. Had the business combination
occurred at the beginning of fiscal 2017, this business combination would have contributed approximately
$86.0 million in revenue and $27.6 million in income before tax and non-controlling interests for the
fifteen months ended December 31, 2017, and consolidated pro forma revenue and income before tax and
non-controlling interests for the same period would have been approximately $164.2 million and $12.6
million. These estimates should not be used as an indicator of past or future performance of the Company
or the acquisition.

**f)** On April 1, 2017, the Company, through a subsidiary, acquired the net assets of six imaging centres in
Florida (the MID FL Acquisition) from Altamonte Springs Diagnostic Imaging Inc. for $9,000,000
($6,000,000 in cash and $3,000,000 (face value, estimated fair value of $2,883,783) in 8.5% per annum
unsecured subordinated convertible debenture (the MID FL Subordinated Note), with a term of three
years). The MID FL Subordinated Note was to be automatically converted into common shares of the
Company in the event the Company completed an initial public offering (IPO) during the term of the MID
FL Subordinated Note. The price of such common shares on conversion of the MID FL Subordinated Note
was to be at a 16.67% discount to the offering price in the IPO. The Company completed its IPO in
December 2017 and the MID FL Subordinated Note was converted into common shares of the Company in
December 2017 in accordance with these terms. The acquired tangible assets include property and
equipment of $3,235,000. The Company has made a fair value determination of the acquired assets and
assumed liabilities as follows:

This acquisition was an opportunity for the Company to increase its economies of scale across Florida. The
goodwill assessed on acquisition, expected to be deductible for income tax purposes, reflects the
Company’s expectation of future benefits from the acquired business and workforce, and potential
synergies from cost savings. The results of operations of the MID FL Acquisition have been included in the
Company’s consolidated statements of net loss and comprehensive loss from the acquisition date. Since the
acquisition date, the MID FL Acquisition contributed revenue of approximately $4.2 million and income
before tax of approximately $0.5 million to the Company’s consolidated results for the fifteen months
ended December 31, 2017.

The Company has estimated the contribution to the Company’s consolidated results from this acquisition
had the business combination occurred at the beginning of the year. Had the business combination
occurred at the beginning of fiscal 2017, this business combination would have contributed approximately
$7.1 million in revenue and $0.9 million in income before tax for the fifteen months ended December 31,
2017, and consolidated pro forma revenue and loss before tax for the same period would have been
approximately $108.3 million and $8.0 million. These estimates should not be used as an indicator of past

Other 6,738,521 6,738,521

130,539,869 100,777,451

The recoverable amount from CGUs was estimated based on an assessment of value-in-use. The methodology
used to test impairment is classified as Level 3 per the fair value hierarchy described in note 17.

The value in use for a CGU or group of CGUs is determined by discounting five-year cash flow projections (cash
flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using perpetuity growth rates). These projections reflect
management’s expectations based on past experience and future estimates of operating performance. The
discount rates are applied to the cash flow projections and are derived from the weighted average cost of capital
for each CGU or group of CGUs.

In measuring the recoverable amounts for goodwill as at December 31, 2018, significant estimates include the
perpetuity growth rates and weighted average cost of capital discount rates, which range from 1.5% to 2.5% and
8.0% to 9.0% (2017 – 1.5% to 2.5% and 8.0% to 9.0%), respectively. Our discount rates are based on market
rates of return, debt to equity ratios, and certain risk premiums, among other things. The perpetuity growth
rates are based on expected economic conditions and a general outlook for the industry.

An impairment charge is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount. No
impairment charges have arisen as a result of the reviews performed as at October 1, 2018. Reasonably possible
changes in key assumptions would not cause the recoverable amount of goodwill to fall below the carrying
value. As there were no indicators of impairment for any of the CGUs, management has not updated any of the
other impairment calculations as at December 31, 2018.

**i)** **Syndicated Loans**

The Company entered into a credit agreement dated August 15, 2018 (the Syndicated Credit Agreement)
with a syndicate of five financial institutions. Under the terms of the Syndicated Credit Agreement, the
Company received a term loan (Syndicated Term Loan) of $100,000,000 (face value) and a revolving
credit facility of $30,000,000, of which $11,900,000 was utilized as at December 31, 2018 (the Syndicated
Revolving Facility, and together with the Syndicated Term Loan, the Syndicated Loans). The Syndicated
Loans can be increased by an additional $40,000,000 subject to certain conditions. The Company used
$11,900,000 of the Syndicated Revolving Facility to partly finance the Broward Acquisition and the
Kissimmee Acquisition (described in note 3). The proceeds of the Syndicated Term Loan were used to
completely settle the S&C Loans for $74,634,848, finance the Rose Acquisition (note 3) and pay related
debt issuance costs. Management determined the fair value of the Syndicated Term Loan to be its face
value of $100,000,000, net of debt issuance costs of approximately $2.2 million. The fair value of the

Effective November 14, 2018, the Company entered into a derivative financial instrument contract with a
financial institution in order to mitigate interest rate risk under the variable interest rate Syndicated Loans.
The derivative financial instrument is an interest rate cap rate of 3.75% (LIBOR) per annum on a notional
amount of 50% of the face value of the Syndicated Term Loan ($50,000,000 as at November 14, 2018). The
termination date of this arrangement is August 31, 2021. The cost of this derivative financial instrument
was $155,000. The Company has not designated this interest rate cap agreement as a cash flow hedge for
accounting purposes. The fair value of this derivative as determined by the financial institution as at
December 31, 2018 represented an asset to the Company of $16,014. Changes in the fair value of this
derivative are recognized in the consolidated statements of net income (loss) and comprehensive income
(loss). In light of entering into this derivative financial instrument contract, the Company decided to
terminate the previous derivative financial instrument contract entered on November 9, 2017 (discussed

amended and restated credit agreement dated August 9, 2017 (the S&C Credit Agreement) with Siemens as
administrative agent and Compass Bank as co-lead arranger. Under the terms of the S&C Credit
Agreement, the previous loan from Siemens increased by $2,000,000 to $27,740,117 (face value) and was
assumed under this credit agreement and an additional term loan of $47,259,883 was advanced to the
Company, resulting in $75,000,000 (face value) of the term loan (the S&C Term Loan) being outstanding.
The net proceeds of the additional term loan were used to repay in full the previous revolving facility from
Siemens of $2,500,000 and finance $44.7 million of the Texas Acquisition. The S&C Credit Agreement
also made available to the Company a revolving facility of up to $5,000,000 (the S&C Revolving Facility,
and together with the S&C Term Loan, the S&C Loans). Management determined the fair value of the S&C
Term Loan to be its face value, net of debt issuance costs of approximately $3.0 million. The fair value was
determined based on management’s estimation of assumptions that market participants would use in
pricing similar liabilities (it is considered a Level 3 liability as described in note 17. The S&C Loans had an
amortized cost balance of $72,219,208 as at December 31, 2017 (face value – $75,000,000). The S&C
Revolving Facility was unutilized during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018.

In accordance with the terms of the S&C Loans, the Company used part of the proceeds of the Syndicated
Term Loan to completely settle the S&C Term Loan on August 15, 2018 for $74,634,848 (face value of
$74,437,500 and accrued interest and related fees of $197,348). The Company also recorded a fair value
loss of $2,426,873 on the extinguishment of the S&C Loans, which was reflected in the consolidated
statements of net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss).

During the fifteen months ended December 31, 2017, the following equity issuances occurred at the Company:

**a)** During the nine months ended June 30, 2017, the Company issued $10.5 million in common shares and
warrants and incurred issuance costs of approximately $1.1 million. This equity issuance included 300,825
warrants to purchase common shares on a 1:1 basis at an exercise price of $2.30 per common share. These
warrants expire on March 10 and 17, 2019. The fair value of these warrants, recognized as a deduction of
issued capital, was determined to be $0.996 per warrant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model
based on the following assumptions: historical common share price volatility of 80%; remaining life of two
years; price per common share on grant of warrants of $2.30; expected dividend yield of zero; and annual
risk-free interest rate of 0.84%.

**b)** During the three months ended September 30, 2017, the following equity issuances occurred at the
Company:

i) In order to partly finance the Texas Acquisition, the Company undertook: (i) a subscription receipts
offering, which generated gross proceeds of approximately $33 million (9,407,223 special warrants
were issued on the automatic conversion of 9,407,223 subscription receipts into special warrants in
accordance with the subscription receipt agreement; a total of 512,004 broker warrants were issued to
the agents in connection therewith); and (ii) $20 million in equity was issued (5,714,285 common
shares at $3.50 per share) to certain sellers in connection with the Texas Acquisition. Each special
warrant was exercised to acquire one common share on December 1, 2017.

Special warrants were issued on automatic conversion of such subscription receipts in accordance
with the subscription receipts agreement. Such special warrants were classified as part of the
Company’s equity. They were converted into common shares of the Company in accordance with the
terms of the agreement in December 2017. On conversion into common shares, the amount of special
warrants was transferred to the common share account of the Company’s equity. The associated
broker warrants issued as part of the subscription receipts offering are assigned an estimated value
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and netted against the value of special warrants. They
are transferred to common shares on exercise of such broker warrants.

Each of the 512,004 broker warrants is exercisable to acquire one common share of the Company, at
an exercise price of $3.50 per common share, until August 8, 2019. The fair value of these warrants,
recognized as a deduction of issued capital, was determined to be $1.523 per warrant using the BlackScholes option pricing model based on the following assumptions: historical common share price
volatility of 80%; remaining life of two years; expected dividend yield of zero; and annual risk-free
interest rate of 1.24%.

The Company incurred equity issuance costs of approximately $2.2 million in connection with this
offering.

the Texas Acquisition, resulting in the issuance of 1,000,000 common shares. The value of 500,000
RSUs ($1,750,000) awarded to the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company was
classified as stock-based compensation cost during the three months ended September 30, 2017. The
value of the 500,000 RSUs ($1,750,000) awarded to the agent was classified as equity issuance cost
on vesting of these RSUs during the three months ended September 30, 2017.

following assumptions: historical common share price volatility of 80%; remaining life of two years;
expected dividend yield of zero; and annual risk-free interest rate of 1.44%.

ii) On November 14, 2017, the Board authorized issuance of 1,841,316 RSUs to certain employees of the
Company and the Board. 1,611,316 of these RSUs were granted on November 15, 2017 and 230,000
RSUs were granted on January 1, 2018. Each granted RSU entitles the holder to one common share of
the Company. These RSUs will vest as follows: 50% on the first anniversary of the date of grant and
50% on the second anniversary of the date of grant. RSUs are assigned a value based on the market
value of the common shares of the Company on the grant date (or the nearest working day prior to the
grant date). Such value is classified as stock-based compensation over the vesting period for all RSUs
awarded to employees or the Board. The RSUs granted on November 15, 2017 were assigned a value

gross proceeds of $35,000,000 (the Offering). The related issuance costs were approximately

warrants (Broker Warrants) in connection with the Offering, each such Broker Warrant entitling
the holder to acquire one common share of the Company at a price of $4.00 per common share for

price volatility of approximately 62%; remaining life of two years; price per common share on grant
of warrants of $4.00; expected dividend yield of zero; and annual risk free interest rate of 1.93%.

iii) On May 24, 2018, the Company announced that PMI completed its previously announced

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
**December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017**

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

The Company’s effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 was -43.95% (2017 – (1.47%)). The
tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in the United States and the relative amounts of
income earned in this jurisdiction, which management expects to be fairly consistent in the near term. It is
also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year but are not consistent from year to year.
The following items had the most significant impact on the difference between the statutory rate of 26.5%
(2017 – 26.5%) and the effective tax rate for 2018:

i) a $4,591,823 (-132.20%) (2017 – $995,303 (-11.88%)) decrease resulting from the unrecognized tax
benefit;

ii) a $1,511,135 (43.51%) (2017 – $859,189 (-10.25%)) increase resulting from the stock-based
compensation (note 16); and

iii) a $220,389 (-6.35%) (2017 – $412,995 (4.93%)) decrease resulting from tax rate differences between
Canada and the United States.

**b)** **Deferred tax assets/liabilities**

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of
assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amount used for income tax purposes.

assessment of the future profitability of the Company, as at December 31, 2018, an unrecognized tax
benefit of $1,796,113 (2017 – $4,150,218) has been recorded to recognize only the portion of the deferred
tax asset that is more likely than not to be realized. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered
realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carry-forward
period are reduced or increased.

**c)** **Tax losses**

The Company has operating loss carry-forwards of $24,436,645 (2017 – $13,892,891), which begin to

###### 15 Commitments and contingencies

The Company is involved in certain legal matters arising from time to time in the normal course of business.
The Company records provisions that reflect management’s best estimate of any potential liability relating to
these matters. The resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

As at December 31, 2018, the Company’s future obligations for minimum annual payments under operating
leases for equipment and facilities for the next five years and thereafter are as follows:

The Company’s operating leases are primarily for its outpatient diagnostic imaging centres and have varying
terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights. The lease terms range from one to twenty-five years. Rent expense
for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 was approximately $11.3 million (fifteen months ended
December 31, 2017 – $9.4 million).

###### 16 Stock-based compensation – options

The Company operates an equity-settled, stock options based payment compensation plan, under which the
Company pays equity instruments of the Company as consideration in exchange for employee services. The
plan is open to directors and certain employees of the Company. The fair value of the grant of options is
recognized in the consolidated statements of net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) as an expense.
The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted. The total
expense is recognized over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the service vesting
conditions are to be satisfied. The maximum number of common shares reserved for issuance, in the aggregate,
under the Company’s option plan (and under any other share compensation arrangements of the Company) is
10% of the aggregate number of common shares which are outstanding from time to time. As at December 31,
2018, this represented 6,237,127 (December 31, 2017 – 5,141,632) common shares.

The Company commenced granting stock options on March 15, 2016, with an initial grant of 2,025,268 options
to purchase common shares on a 1:1 basis, which represented 10% of the total outstanding shares of the
Company as at September 30, 2015. The exercise price for these options was $0.50 per share. These options will
vest over a three-year period from the date of issue (34%, 33%, and 33% per year, respectively). The options
have an expiry date ten years from the date of issue. The Company granted no stock options during 2017.

During the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, the Company granted 2,188,000 stock options on
November 16, 2018, to purchase common shares on a 1:1 basis with an exercise price of $3.74 per share. The
aggregate fair value of the stock options granted during 2018 was determined to be $3,211,765 (2017 – $nil).
These options will vest over a three-year period from the date of issue (34%, 33% and 33% per year,
respectively) and have an expiry date of seven years from the date of issue.

The weighted average contractual life of the outstanding options as at December 31, 2018 was 7.04 years
(December 31, 2017 – 8.21 years). The total number of stock options exercisable as at December 31, 2018 was
1,356,929 (December 31, 2017 – 688,591). The total fair value of stock options that vested during the twelve
months ended December 31, 2018 was $706,866 (fifteen months ended December 31, 2017 – $728,287).

The fair value of the stock options granted during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 was estimated
to be $1.4679 per option using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on the following assumptions:
historical common share price volatility of 33%; remaining life of seven years; expected dividend yield of nil;
and an annual risk free interest rate of 2.33%. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, the
Company recorded a total stock-based options compensation expense of approximately $681,412 (fifteen
months ended December 31, 2017 – $1,022,257). The total compensation cost related to unvested options
awards not yet recognized is approximately $2,936,556 (fifteen months ended December 31, 2017 – $406,203)
and will be recognized over a remaining vesting period of 2.88 years (fifteen months ended December 31, 2017 –
1.21 years).

###### 17 Risk management arising from financial instruments

In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to risks that can affect its operating performance.
These risks, and the actions taken to manage them, are as follows:

**Fair value**

The carrying value of cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates their
fair value given their short-term nature.

-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
**December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017**

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

The carrying value of the non-current portion of finance leases approximates their fair value given the
difference between the discount rates used to recognize the liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and the
market rates of interest is insignificant. The estimated fair values of other non-current assets and liabilities
were as follows:


**2018**

**$**


**2017**

**$**


Loans to related parties 495,000   
Bank Loans payable 110,244,000 75,025,000

Wesley Chapel Loan payable 1,823,000   
Subordinated notes payable 1,476,000   
Subordinated notes – earn-out 169,642   
Derivative financial instruments (16,014) (21,619)

113,696,628 75,003,381

Financial instruments recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets are classified using a fair value
hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements. The fair value hierarchy
has the following levels:

- Level 1

Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Pricing inputs are
based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the
ability to access at the measurement date. For securities, the valuations are based on quoted prices of the
securities that are readily and regularly available in an active market, and accordingly, a significant degree
of judgment is not required. As at December 31, 2018, the Company did not have any financial assets or
liabilities subsequently measured at fair value under the Level 1 category.

- Level 2

Pricing inputs are based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for
identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model based valuation techniques for
which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable
market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. The estimated fair value of the
liabilities that are recognized at fair value, and subsequently measured at amortized cost, are determined
using Level 2 inputs primarily related to comparable market prices. As at December 31, 2018, the
derivative financial instruments were measured at fair value under the Level 2 category on recognition.
The derivative financial instruments are subsequently remeasured at fair value under the Level 2 category.

- Level 3

Pricing inputs are generally unobservable for the assets or liabilities and include situations where there is
little, if any, market activity for the investment. The inputs into the determination of fair value require
management’s judgment or estimation of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the
assets or liabilities. The fair values are therefore determined using model based techniques that include
option pricing models, discounted cash flow models, and similar techniques.

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
**December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017**

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

The loans to related parties, the Syndicated Loans, S&C Loans, WSFS Note, Wesley Chapel Loan, Subordinated
Notes and Subordinated Notes – Earn-out were measured at fair value under the Level 3 category on
recognition. The Subordinated Notes – Earn-out is subsequently remeasured at fair value under the Level 3
category. The key inputs used to determine fair value for the loans include market rates of interest and for
earnouts, discounted cash flows.

There were no significant transfers between levels during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and the
fifteen months ended December 31, 2017.

Financial instruments are classified into one of the following categories: amortized cost, fair value through
profit or loss and fair value through other comprehensive income.

Measured at fair value through profit or loss 153,628 (21,619)

**Credit risk**

Credit risk arises from the potential a counterparty will fail to perform its obligations. The Company is exposed
to credit risk from customers. The Company grants credit to its customers in the normal course of business. The
consolidated financial statements take into account an allowance for bad debts. The Company is exposed to
credit risk from its customers but the concentration of the risk is minimized because of the large customer base
and its dispersion across different payers. During the year, the Company may have deposits with financial
institutions that exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits. As at December 31, 2018, the Company
had cash of $19,326,412 (2017 – $12,145,481) and accounts receivable of $29,810,501 (2017 – $12,968,010).

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
**December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017**

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

Collectibility of the receivables is reviewed regularly and an allowance based on lifetime expected credit losses is
established as necessary. Current economic conditions and historical collection experience are considered when
determining whether to make an allowance. The same factors are considered when determining whether to
write off amounts charged to the allowance for credit losses. The aging of these receivables, net of allowances, is
as follows:

Writeoffs (2,760,040) (2,563,048)

Allowance – End of period 8,473,764 4,553,094

**Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk is the risk the Company may encounter difficulty in raising funds to meet its financial
commitments. The Company is exposed to liquidity risk mainly with respect to the Bank Loans. The Company
ensures there is sufficient liquidity to meet its short-term business requirements, taking into account its
anticipated cash flows from operations and its holdings of cash.

**Currency risk**

Currency risk is the risk to the Company’s earnings that arises from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and
the degree of volatility of those rates. In the normal course of business, the Company may enter into foreign
exchange contracts with financial institutions to hedge the value of foreign currency denominated assets. Gains
and losses arising from these contracts offset the losses and gains from the underlying hedged transactions. As
at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company did not enter into any foreign exchange contracts
that would expose the Company to currency risk.

**December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017**

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

**Interest rate risk**

Interest rate risk is the risk the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of
changes in market interest rates. Changes in lending rates can cause fluctuations in interest payments and cash
flows. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments to alter the effects of this risk, except as
noted below. The Company is partly financed through bank loans, which bear interest at rates tied to the onemonth LIBOR.

As noted in note 10, effective November 14, 2018, the Company entered into a derivative financial instrument
contract with a financial institution in order to mitigate interest rate risk under the variable interest rate
Syndicated Loans. The derivative financial instrument is an interest rate cap rate of 3.75% (LIBOR) per annum
on a notional amount of $50,000,000, representing 50% of the face value of the $100,000,000 Syndicated
Term Loan.

Variable interest rates on the Company’s debts are as follows:

Syndicated Loans one-month LIBOR plus Applicable Rate

###### 20 New accounting standards

The standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuance of the
Company’s consolidated financial statements are disclosed below. The Company intends to adopt these
standards, if applicable, when they become effective.

**IFRS 16, Leases**

In January 2016, the IASB released IFRS 16, Leases, replacing IAS 17, Leases, and related interpretations. The
new standard eliminates the classification of leases as either operating or finance leases and requires the
recognition of assets and liabilities for all leases, unless the lease term is twelve months or less or the underlying
asset has a low value. Application of the standard is mandatory for annual reporting periods beginning on or
after January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The IFRS 16 transition requirements provide the option of
adopting a full retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach with optional practical expedients
available. The Company has performed preliminary analysis as part of its assessment of IFRS 16 transition
approaches, and intends to adopt the standard on a modified retrospective basis. The Company continues to
finalize its approach on the use of the optional practical expedients.

The Company expects the adoption of IFRS 16 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial
statements, given its current operating lease commitments (note 15). New assets and liabilities will be
recognized on the consolidated balance sheets for the Company’s operating leases. On the consolidated
statements of net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss), the Company will replace the current lease
expense with depreciation for right-of-use assets and finance expense on lease liabilities. There will be no
change to the amount of cash flows as part of the underlying leases.

The Company continues to evaluate the impact of the standard on its consolidated financial statements.

**IFRIC 23, Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments**

In June 2017, the IASB issued IFRIC 23, Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments, with a mandatory effective
date of January 1, 2019. The interpretations provide guidance on how to value uncertain income tax positions
based on the probability of whether the relevant tax authorities will accept the Company’s tax treatments. A
company is to assume that a taxation authority with the right to examine any amounts reported to it will
examine those amounts and will have full knowledge of all relevant information when doing so. IFRIC 23 is to
be applied by recognizing the cumulative effect of initially applying these guidelines in opening retained
earnings without adjusting comparative information. The Company believes that it is reasonable that there are
no uncertain tax positions required to be reported on IRS Form UTP, Uncertain Tax Positions Statement, on its
consolidated financial statements. The Company will continue to evaluate the impact and application of this
standard.

###### 24 Subsequent events

**a)** During March 2017, the Company issued 300,825 warrants to purchase common shares on a 1:1 basis at an
exercise price of $2.30 per common share. These warrants expired on March 10 and 17, 2019. During the
three months ended September 30, 2018, 120,330 of these warrants were exercised into common shares.
The remaining 180,495 warrants were exercised into common shares prior to expiry.

**b)** As previously noted, the Board had granted 315,000 RSUs to certain employees of the Company between
January 1 and March 12, 2018. While 50% of these RSUs vested between January 1 and March 12, 2019 in
accordance with the terms of the RSU Plan, only 25,000 of these vested RSUs have currently been
exercised. Accordingly, 25,000 common shares were issued by the Company on March 18, 2019. The
remaining 132,500 of these vested RSUs were settled for common shares prior to June 30, 2019. In
accordance with the terms of the RSU Plan, 50% of the above-noted 315,000 RSUs will vest between
January 1 and March 12, 2020. Twenty-five thousand RSUs from these unvested RSUs were settled for
common shares on October 1, 2019 in accordance with the terms of the RSU Plan.

**c)** During August 2017, the Company issued 512,004 warrants to purchase common shares on a 1:1 basis at an
exercise price of $3.50 per common share. The expiry date for these warrants was August 8, 2019. During
the three months ended June 30, 2019, 256,002 of these warrants were exercised into common shares.

**d)** On April 1, 2019, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets used in connection with a single
imaging centre located in Davie, Florida (Davie Acquisition) from the former operators of such centre for a
purchase price of $450,000.

**e)** On April 15, 2019, the Company announced that it had, through a subsidiary, entered into purchase
agreements to acquire 27 imaging centres (Florida – 21 and Georgia – 6) operated under ADG, The
Imaging Centers of West Palm and Elite Radiology of Georgia. All of these centres were managed by ADG’s
management team. On May 31, 2019, the Company announced the closing of these acquisitions. Pursuant
to the purchase agreements, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of
ADG Acquisition Holdings, Inc., TIC Acquisition Holdings, LLC and SFL Radiology Holdings, LLC (the
ADG Acquisitions).

The total purchase price for the ADG Acquisitions at closing (including preliminary working capital
adjustments and payment for cash acquired) was approximately $216.0 million, of which $23.4 million
was satisfied by the issuance of 6.25 million common shares of the Company at a price of $3.75 per share
based on the share price at the close of May 31, 2019. The balance of this purchase price was mostly
financed through the Term Loans (defined below). A portion of the purchase price payable in respect of the
acquisition of SFL Radiology Holdings, LLC is subject to an earn-out based on annualized revenues earned
in the first two quarters of 2020 less certain costs.

In connection with the ADG Acquisitions, on May 31, 2019, the Company amended its previous credit
agreement dated August 15, 2018 (such amended credit agreement, the May 2019 Credit Agreement)
whereby it increased the size of its credit facilities and increased the number of syndicated lenders from
five to nine financial institutions. Under the terms of the May 2019 Credit Agreement, the Company
received a term loan A and term loan B (Term Loan A, Term Loan B and collectively, the Term Loans) of

**December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017**

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

$66,000,000 and $266,000,000, respectively (face value) and a revolving credit facility of $50,000,000,
of which $3,300,000 was utilized as at May 31, 2019 (the May 2019 Revolving Facility, and together with
the Term Loans, the May 2019 Loans). $16 million of the Term Loan A is subject to a delayed draw and is
available to the Company for use in potential acquisitions until October 15, 2019. The term of the May 2019
Loans is five years. The May 2019 Loans can be increased by an additional $100,000,000 subject to
certain conditions. The proceeds of the Term Loans were used to settle the Syndicated Loans for
$112,482,181, the principal outstanding under the Subordinated Note and related accrued and unpaid
interest for $1,596,250, partly finance the ADG Acquisitions and Deltona Acquisition in May 2019 and pay
related debt issuance costs.

**f)** On May 31, 2019, the Company acquired, through a subsidiary, a single outpatient diagnostic imaging
centre in Deltona, Florida for a cash consideration of $648,387 (Deltona Acquisition).

**g)** Subsequent to December 31, 2018, the Company settled certain claims affecting PMI relating to periods
arising prior to August 9, 2017, the date the Company acquired PMI. The Company received an aggregate
of approximately $4.1 million, approximately $2.9 million of which was received after December 31, 2018,
from the escrow fund maintained for the sellers of PMI as a result of indemnity claims under the purchase
agreement for PMI to fully and finally settle the claims affecting PMI.

**h)** On August 16, 2019, the Company acquired, through a subsidiary, five outpatient diagnostic imaging
centres in El Paso, Texas for cash consideration of approximately $11 million.

**i)** On October 4, 2019, the Company acquired, through a subsidiary, three outpatient diagnostic imaging
centres near West Palm Beach, Florida, for cash consideration of approximately $18 million. This
acquisition was mostly financed through the delayed draw portion of the Company’s Term Loans of
$16 million and approximately $1 million under the Company’s revolving credit facility, both under the
May 2019 Credit Agreement.

 Management’s Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements
 Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 Auditor’s Responsibility 
 Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. 
 An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. 
 We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 Nature of Business

 ADG Acquisition Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) is a C-Corporation organized in the state of Florida on December 7, 2015. The Company was organized in connection with the conversion of all outstanding ownership interests of ADG Acquisition Holdings, LLC and Subsidiaries (“ADH”) to 100% of the newly issued and outstanding shares of the Company on December 11, 2015. Concurrently, all ownership of the Company was transferred to a newly formed employee stock ownership plan (see Note 9) through a series of stock redemption and sales transactions. The Company owns and operates fourteen imaging centers throughout Florida. Imaging services provided by the Company consist of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (“MRI”), Radiography (“X-Ray”), Computerized Tomography (“CT”), and Ultrasound. 

 Acquisition Method for Business Combinations

 In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 805, Business Combinations, of the Financial Accounting Standard Board (“FASB”), assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition. Under the acquisition method, the difference between the consideration transferred and the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded either as goodwill or a bargain purchase gain. Acquisition related costs including professional fees are expensed as incurred.

 The Company determined the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired through application of FASB ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurements. Fair value measurements were based on management judgments and management estimates (level 3 inputs under FASB ASC 820-10).

 Basis of Accounting

 The Company uses the accrual method of accounting. Under this method, revenues are recognized in the period earned and expenses are recognized when incurred. 

 Principles of Consolidation

 The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.

 Use of Estimates

 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

 Goodwill

 In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 350, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below its carrying amount. The Company has not recorded any impairment losses related to goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.

 Risks and Uncertainties

 The Company is highly dependent on referrals from physicians who have no contractual obligation or economic incentive to refer patients to the Company’s facilities. The Company is also subject to various state and federal laws and regulations which prohibit physicians from referring patients to entities with which they have a financial relationship (an ownership interest or compensation arrangement) and prohibit the provision of certain medical services by non-physicians and/or the splitting of fees between physicians and non-physicians. The Company believes its operations are conducted in material compliance with existing applicable laws.

 Approximately 55% of the Company’s scan volume is derived from patient charges billed under the Personal Injury Protection statute of Florida law (Florida statute 627.736 – the “PIP” statute). This statute has been subjected to legislative scrutiny in recent years and may come under review again in future legislative sessions. Any significant change to the PIP statute could impact future revenues of the Company for its diagnostic imaging services.

 Cash

 The Company maintains cash balances at two financial institutions that are insured under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (“FDIC”) Transaction Account Guarantee Program. From time to time, cash balances in these accounts may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits with financial institutions.

 Accounts Receivable and Net Patient Service Revenues

 Accounts receivable and related revenues are recognized on the date diagnostic imaging services are performed based on amounts the Company believes are reasonably assured of being collected. Amounts are recorded at established billing rates and reduced by estimated allowances for contractual adjustments and uncollectible amounts. Contractual adjustments result from differences between the rates charged for services performed and reimbursement rates paid by insurance companies, government-sponsored healthcare programs and other third-party payors.

 Allowances for contractual adjustments and uncollectible amounts are based on estimated collection rates, changes in payor mix, specific payor collection issues, changes in contract pricing and the aging of accounts receivables. The Company continuously monitors those factors affecting the collectability of accounts receivables and adjusts estimated allowances as final settlements are determined and as estimates of future collections change. Depending on the changes made in the allowances, net revenues would increase or decrease.

 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

 Concentration of Credit Risk

 Accounts receivables included in the consolidated balance sheets consist primarily of amounts from insurance carriers billed under the PIP statute and amounts billed through Letters of Protection (promises to pay) with attorneys, all in connection with the PIP statute. Collections from insurance carriers are based on fee schedules prescribed in the PIP statute. Collections from attorneys can take up to four to seven years or more depending on when and if the patient’s case is settled.

 Premises and Equipment

 All premises and equipment, including leasehold improvements are recorded at cost.

 Maintenance and repairs, which do not improve efficiency or extend useful lives, are charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation and amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets or the remaining lease term which range from two to ten years. Amortization of assets under capital leases is included in depreciation and amortization. 

 Medical equipment 5 – 7 years Office equipment 2 – 7 years Computer equipment 3 – 7 years Furniture and fixtures 5 years Leasehold improvements 10 years

 Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the remaining life of the lease.

 Impairment of Long-lived Assets

 In accordance with ASC 360-10, Property, Plant, and Equipment, the Company evaluates its long- lived assets for financial impairment as events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets by measuring the carrying amounts of the assets against their estimated undiscounted future cash flows. If such evaluations indicate that the future undiscounted cash flows of certain long-lived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets, the assets are adjusted to their fair value. The Company did not record an impairment loss related to long-lived assets for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.

 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

 Debt Issue Costs

 Debt issue costs related to term debt are amortized using the straight-line method, which approximates the interest method, over the term of the respective loans and are presented as a reduction of long-term debt on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in accordance with ASC 835-30-45, Imputation of Interest. The gross carrying amount as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $419,745 and $1,159,056, respectively, with accumulated amortization of $69,958 and $442,786, respectively. Amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $786,228 and $222,478, respectively. Amortization expense in 2018 includes the write off of debt issue costs on refinanced debt of $716,270.

 Puttable Warrants

 The Company issued 727,273 warrants to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and former majority owner (the “Holder”) of ADH in connection with the formation of an employee stock ownership plan in December, 2015 (see Note 9). The warrant agreement contains a put right requiring the Company to redeem all or a portion of the warrants at a price as set forth therein in the event of a change of control or any time following the one year anniversary of the final payment on the subordinated note due the Holder. Puttable warrants create a conditional obligation of the Company and as such, are recorded as a liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet in accordance with ASC 480-10-55-30, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. The Company calculated the initial fair value of the warrants as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. All future changes in the fair value of the warrants will be recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in accordance with ASC 470-20-25, Debt. The fair value of the warrants at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $6,070,000 and $5,800,000, respectively.

 Income Taxes

 Income taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the consolidated financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes resulting primarily from the tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.

 Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the consolidated financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the fiscal period that includes the enactment date.

 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

 Income Taxes (continued)

 The Company considers all positive and negative evidence available in determining the potential realization of deferred tax assets, including the scheduled reversal of temporary differences, recent cumulative losses, recent and projected future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In making this determination, the Company places greater emphasis on recent cumulative losses and recent tax planning strategies due to the inherent lack of subjectivity associated with these factors. In addition, the Company is subject to periodic examination of its income tax returns resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. To the extent the Company were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or to be required to pay amounts in excess of such accruals, the Company’s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected.

 The Company is subject to routine income tax audits by taxing jurisdictions; however, there are currently no audits for any tax periods in progress. Management believes it is no longer subject to income tax examinations for years prior to the year ended December 31, 2014.

 Subsequent Events

 The Company evaluated subsequent events through the Independent Auditors’ Report date. On April 15, 2019, the Company (along with other related party entities of the Company) entered into an agreement with a Canadian-based company to sell all outstanding equity interests for approximately $214,000,000. There were no other additional material subsequent events that required recognition or additional disclosure in these consolidated financial statements.

 New Accounting Pronouncements

 On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The standard’s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This standard also includes expanded disclosure requirements that result in an entity providing users of financial statements with comprehensive information about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the entity’s contracts with customers. This standard will be effective for the calendar year ending December 31, 2019. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of this ASU on the consolidated financial statements.

 In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02, Leases. The ASU requires all leases with lease terms more than 12 months to be capitalized as a right-of-use asset and lease liability on the balance sheet at the date of lease commencement. Leases will be classified as either finance leases or operating leases. This distinction will be relevant for the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. This ASU will be effective for the Company for the year ending December 31, 2020. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of this ASU on the consolidated financial statements.

 2. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

 In May 2017, the Company acquired an imaging center in Jacksonville, Florida through an Asset Purchase Agreement with an entity owned by members or executives of the Company. In connection with the purchase, the Company acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of the selling entity in exchange for cash consideration paid by a lender of $7,000,000 plus contingent consideration (“earn-out”) of $125,000 per month beginning January 2018, payable over a period of seven years, at an amount not to exceed $5,000,000. The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the calculation of goodwill reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

 Consideration transferred: Cash $ 7,000,000 Contingent consideration (see below) 3,777,658 Accrued liabilities assumed 408,510
 11,186,168
 Less assets acquired: Cash (415,000) Prepaid expenses (12,196) Premises and equipment (1,139,540) (1,566,736)

 Goodwill $ 9,619,432

 The monthly earn-out payment noted above is contingent upon the acquired business exceeding EBITDA of $1,800,000, as determined each month end over a trailing twelve month period. In accordance with ASC 805-10, Business Combinations, contingent consideration is part of the total consideration transferred and is recorded at acquisition date at the estimated fair value of future payouts. The Company estimates that earn-out payments will be paid in full as scheduled over the remaining payout period and as such, recorded a liability at acquisition date of $3,777,658 for the estimated fair value of the payout obligation. Fair value was estimated based on the present value of the remaining monthly earn-out payments (28 months as of December 31, 2018 and 40 months as of December 31, 2017), using an interest rate of 13.5%. Future changes in the estimate of the payout obligation are recorded as a gain or charge to current period earnings. The fair value of the payout obligation was $3,035,582 and $4,085,923 at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively as a result payments on the contingent consideration and interest component of the fair value computation.

 3. INTANGIBLE ASSET – LEASE RIGHT

 During 2015, the Company acquired the lease rights to open a new imaging center in Palm Beach, Florida in exchange for seller short term financing of $7,200,000. Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, no other assets were acquired or liabilities were assumed and as such, the entire purchase price is recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as an intangible asset.  The intangible asset is being amortized over 15 years representing the term of the lease plus renewal periods reasonably expected to be executed. Annual amortization expense for future years as well as 2018 and 2017 is $480,000.

 4. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE – NET

 Accounts receivable are recorded at established billing rates less allowances for contractual adjustments and uncollectible amounts. Accounts receivable are recorded on the date the diagnostic procedure is performed. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company provided an allowance of doubtful accounts totaling $1,200,000 and $700,000, respectively, which is presented as a direct reduction of non-current accounts receivable on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

 At December 31, 2018 and 2017, accounts receivable (including the noncurrent portion) were $16,410,048 and $14,286,431, respectively. Gross receivables as reported on the Company’s billing system at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were approximately $57,000,000 and $44,000,000, respectively. Collections on certain receivables generally exceed one year and as a result, management has classified 20% of receivables as long term. 

 5. PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT – NET

 Premises and equipment consisted of the following at December 31, 2018 and 2017:

     2018     2017     Medical equipment $ 7,577,900 $ 5,295,260

 Aggregate maturities of long-term debt are as follows:

 YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31:
 2019 $    3,300,000 2020 4,125,000 2021 18,853,555 2022 5,500,000 2023 23,375,000 Thereafter    37,169,088

 $   91,972,856

 The notes payable contain certain covenants and restrictions. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants. 

 Interest expense related to long-term debt for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was approximately $10,136,000 and $10,348,000, respectively.

 8.  INCOME TAXES

 The components of the provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 are as follows: 2018 2017

 Current $ 975,974 $ 254,365 Deferred (370,696) (202,748)

 Total provision $ 605,278 $ 51,617

 The Company’s effective tax rate differs from what would be expected if the Federal statutory rate of 21% for 2018 (newly enacted tax rate effective for 2018) or 34% for 2017 was applied to income before taxes. For 2018, the higher effective tax rate resulted primarily from the effect of state income taxes and the inclusion in these financial statements of nondeductible expenses related to meals and entertainment and for expense recognized for the increase in the liability for puttable warrants. For 2017, the effective tax rate increased for these same items but was overall lower than the Federal statutory rate as a result of adjustments recognized in the Company’s net deferred taxes liabilities for changes in tax laws and corporate tax rates. Reductions to the Company’s net deferred tax liability as of December 31, 2017 resulting from changes in corporate tax rates were approximately $201,000.

 Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The significant components of the Company’s deferred tax liabilities and assets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 are as follows: 

 2018 2017
 Deferred tax liabilities: Tax depreciation in excess of book $ 1,154,642 $ 548,334 Tax amortization of goodwill in excess of book 532,479 328,091 Other      23,640       40,858

 1,668,905      504,731

 Net deferred tax liability $ 41,856 $    412,552

 The Company receives favorable tax treatment for contributions made to the employee stock ownership plan (see discussion at Note 9). Contributions made prior to September 15[th] of the following year are deductible in the tax return of the preceding year. For the plan year ended December 31, 2018, the Company made contributions to the plan on April 9, 2019 and on December 31, 2018 of approximately $1,333,000 and 2,485,000, respectively. For the plan year ended December 31, 2017, the Company made contributions to the plan on December 20, 2017 of approximately $2,465,000. In accordance with ASC 718-740-45-5, Compensation – Stock Compensation, the tax effect of deductible amounts in excess of expense recorded in the consolidated financial statements (related to the plan contribution) is recognized as a credit to shareholders’ equity.  The Company recorded credits to shareholders’ equity for deductible plan expenses in excess of related book expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 of approximately $470,000 and $240,000, respectively.

 The Company performs an evaluation of the realizability of its deferred tax assets on an annual basis.  The Company considers all positive and negative evidence available in determining the potential of realizing deferred tax assets, including the scheduled reversal of temporary differences, recent and projected future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The Company did not record a valuation allowance as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 against its deferred income tax assets as they are more likely than not to be realized in future periods.

 The Company intends to request a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) granting relief for the omission of a certain technical filing form required by Federal tax regulations in order to file returns on a consolidated basis. The Company has filed consolidated returns since its conversion to a C-Corporation on December 11, 2015.  Since the statute closes on the 2015 short period return in September 2019, the Company will likely seek the ruling for 2016 and amend/file on a

 subsidiary level basis for the period December 12, 2015 to December 31, 2015. The Company is unable, at this time, to estimate any possible tax liability for periods after 2015 if the IRS were ultimately to rule against the availability of filing consolidated returns. The Company does not expect any significant tax liability to be generated as a result of filing returns for the 20 day period in 2015 on a subsidiary level basis.

 9. EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN

 In December 2015, the Company formed an employee stock ownership plan (the “ESOP”). Prior to forming the ESOP, the former members of ADH converted their membership interests into 1,000,000 shares of a newly formed C-Corporation, ADG Acquisition Holdings, Inc. (referred to throughout these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements as the “Company”). In connection with the ESOP transaction, the Company redeemed 561,500 of the 1,000,000 outstanding shares for $34,797,201. 

 Concurrently, the ESOP acquired from the Company the redeemed shares plus the remaining 438,500 outstanding shares held by the majority owner for a total purchase price of $61,971,863. The purchase price was funded by an internal loan between the Company and the ESOP for the same amount. In accordance with ASC 718-40, Employee Stock Ownership Plans, the loan between the Company and the ESOP and the related interest income (to the Company) and interest expense (to the ESOP) are not reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The cost of those shares (pledged as collateral for the internal loan) are reported as Unearned ESOP Shares in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 

 Under ASC 718-40, the annual contribution to the ESOP by the Company (equal to the ESOP’s debt service on the internal loan as discussed above) is also not reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Contributions are deductible in the Company’s consolidated tax return if funded prior to September 15th of the following year. As the internal loan is repaid, shares are released from collateral and allocated to active employees based on the provisions of the plan document.

 Compensation expense is recorded in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the post ESOP period based on the shares released and the fair value of the those shares as estimated by the Company. Shares released to the ESOP for 2018 and 2017 were 38,571.62 and 24,757.89, respectively. The Company recorded compensation expense for those shares of $424,288 and $257,482 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, based on the estimated fair value per share of $11.00 and $10.40, respectively. The cost of those shares to the ESOP of $61.97 per share is recorded as a reduction to Unearned ESOP Shares with the difference between fair value and cost per share recorded as an increase of decrease to accumulated deficit.

 The ESOP covers all employees who have reached 21 years old and who have been an employee of the Company for at least one year.

 As the Company is not traded on an established securities market, the ESOP includes a put option, if the owners of distributed shares desire to sell their shares, the Company is required to purchase the shares at fair value as defined by the ESOP for a specified time period after distribution of the shares from the ESOP.

###### INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

 TO THE MEMBERS SFL RADIOLOGY HOLDINGS, LLC AND ELITE RADIOLOGY OF GEORGIA, LLC

 Report on the Consolidated Financial Statements

 We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of SFL Radiology Holdings, LLC and Elite Radiology of Georgia, LLC which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018, and the related consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income, changes in members’ equity, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements.

 Management’s Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements

 Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

 Auditor’s Responsibility

 Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.

 An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.

 We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 Nature of Business

 SFL Radiology Holdings, LLC (“SFL”) is a limited liability company organized in the state of Florida on September 15, 2015. SFL was initially organized for the primary purpose of acquiring the outstanding membership interests in First Coast Imaging, LLC (“FCI”) on September 30, 2015. FCI performed imaging services consisting of magnetic resonance imaging (“MRI”) and radiography (“X-Ray”) in Jacksonville, Florida. In May 2017, SFL sold FCI (see Note 3) to a related party and as a result, had no other operating activities at that time other than acquiring and leasing medical equipment.

 During July 2015, SFL entered into a Line of Credit Agreement (the “LOC”) with Elite Radiology of Georgia, LLC (“Elite”) to borrow up to $2,000,000, which was amended in June 2017 for up to $4,000,000. Under the terms of the LOC, SFL advanced funds on a periodic basis for Elite’s working capital needs. In addition, effective May 1, 2018, SFL entered into an Administrative Services Agreement (the “ASA”) with Elite. Under the terms of the ASA, SFL provides the following services to each the entity’s locations: human resources, information management, technical support, marketing techniques, and other administrative and support services. All equipment leases of SFL are to Elite. Elite is a limited liability company organized in the state of Georgia on July 1, 2015. Elite owns and operates four imaging centers throughout Georgia. Imaging services provided by Elite consist of MRI and X-Ray.

 Variable Interest Entity

 In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standard Board’s (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 810, Consolidation, a reporting entity with a variable interest in another company is required to include the assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses of that separate company (i.e., consolidate with the financial statements of the reporting entity) when the variable interest is determined to be a controlling financial interest. Under ASC 810, a reporting entity is considered to have a controlling financial interest in a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”) if: 1.) the reporting entity has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance and 2.) the reporting entity has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could be potentially significant to the VIE.

 As a result of the financial relationship established through the LOC and ASA noted above, Elite qualifies as a variable interest entity as SFL has the power to direct the activities of and is owed significant amounts from Elite. As a result, SFL is considered the primary beneficiary of Elite, and accordingly, the assets and liabilities and revenue and expenses of Elite are included in these consolidated financial statements. Due to SFL’s economic interest as described, the entirety of Elite’s operations is reflected as being attributable to SFL in these consolidated financial statements.

 Principles of Consolidation

 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of SFL and Elite (collectively, the “Company”). All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.

 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

 Acquisition Method for Business Combinations

 In accordance with FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition. Under the acquisition method, the difference between the consideration transferred and the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded either as goodwill or a bargain purchase gain. Acquisition related costs including professional fees are expensed as incurred.

 The Company determined the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired through application of FASB ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurements. Fair value measurements were based on management judgments and management estimates (level 3 inputs under FASB ASC 820-10).

 Basis of Accounting

 The Company uses the accrual method of accounting. Under this method, revenues are recognized in the period earned and expenses are recognized when incurred.

 Use of Estimates

 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

 Goodwill

 In accordance with FASB ASC 350, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below its carrying amount. The Company has not recorded any impairment losses related to goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2018.

 Risks and Uncertainties

 Elite is highly dependent on referrals from physicians who have no contractual obligation or economic incentive to refer patients to the Company’s facilities. The Company is also subject to various state and federal laws and regulations which prohibit physicians from referring patients to entities with which they have a financial relationship (an ownership interest or compensation arrangement) and prohibit the provision of certain medical services by non-physicians and/or the splitting of fees between physicians and non-physicians. The Company believes its operations are conducted in material compliance with existing applicable laws.

 Cash

 The Company maintains cash balances at financial institutions that are insured under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (“FDIC”) Transaction Account Guarantee Program. From time to time, cash balances in these accounts may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits with financial institutions.

 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

 Accounts Receivable and Net Patient Service Revenues

 Accounts receivable and related revenues are recognized on the date diagnostic imaging services are performed based on amounts Elite believes are reasonably assured of being collected. Amounts are recorded at established billing rates and reduced by estimated allowances for contractual adjustments and uncollectible amounts. Contractual adjustments result from differences between the rates charged for services performed and reimbursement rates paid by insurance companies, government-sponsored healthcare programs and other third-party payors.

 Allowances for contractual adjustments and uncollectible amounts are based on estimated collection rates, changes in payor mix, specific payor collection issues, changes in contract pricing and the aging of accounts receivables. Elite continuously monitors those factors affecting the collectability of accounts receivables and adjusts estimated allowances as final settlements are determined and as estimates of future collections change. Depending on the changes made in the allowances, net revenues would increase or decrease.

 Concentrations of Credit Risk

 Accounts receivable included in the consolidated balance sheet consist primarily of amounts billed through Letters of Protection (promises to pay) with attorneys. Collections from attorneys can take up to six months to seven years or more depending on when and if the patient’s case is settled.

 Property and Equipment

 All property and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are recorded at cost. Maintenance and repairs, which do not improve efficiency or extend useful lives, are charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation and amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets or the remaining lease term.


###### Medical equipment Computer equipment Furniture and fixtures


######     5 years   5 years 5 years


###### Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the remaining life of the lease.

 Impairment of Long-lived Assets

 In accordance with ASC 360-10, Property, Plant, and Equipment, the Company evaluates its long-lived assets for financial impairment as events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets by measuring the carrying amounts of the assets against their estimated undiscounted future cash flows. If such evaluations indicate that the future undiscounted cash flows of certain long-lived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets, the assets are adjusted to their fair value. The Company has not recorded any impairment losses related to any long-lived assets for the year ended December 31, 2018.

 Debt Issue Costs

 Debt issue costs are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method, over the term of the respective loans and are presented as a reduction of long-term debt on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The gross carrying amount as of December 31, 2018 was $48,741 with accumulated amortization of $23,569. Amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $3,769.

 Income Taxes

 SFL, with the consent of its members, have elected under the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) to be taxed as a Partnership. In lieu of corporation Federal and state income taxes, the members of a limited liability company are taxed on their proportionate share of a company’s taxable income. Therefore, no provision or liability for Federal income taxes has been included in these consolidated financial statements.

 Subsequent Events

 The Company evaluated subsequent events through the Independent Auditors’ Report date. On April 15, 2019, SFL (along with other related party entities of the Company) entered into an agreement with a Canadian-based company to sell all outstanding equity interests for approximately $214,000,000. On April 26, 2019, Elite acquired certain assets from an imaging center in Georgia under an asset purchase agreement for a cash purchase price of $300,000. There were no other additional material subsequent events that required recognition or additional disclosure in these consolidated financial statements.

 New Accounting Pronouncements

 On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The standard’s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This standard also includes expanded disclosure requirements that result in an entity providing users of financial statements with comprehensive information about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the entity’s contracts with customers. This standard will be effective for the calendar year ending December 31, 2019. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of this ASU on the consolidated financial statements.

 In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-02, Leases. The ASU requires all leases with lease terms more than 12 months to be capitalized as a right-of-use asset and lease liability on the balance sheet at the date of lease commencement. Leases will be classified as either finance leases or operating leases. This distinction will be relevant for the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. This ASU will be effective for the Company for the year ending December 31, 2020. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of this ASU on the consolidated financial statements.

 2. ACQUISITION

 During October 2018, Elite acquired an imaging center in Duluth, GA in exchange for cash consideration of $1,450,000. There were no liabilities assumed in connection with this acquisition. The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and the calculation of goodwill reporting in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

    Consideration transferred: Cash $   1,450,000

    Less assets acquired: Fixed assets (600,000)

    Goodwill $ 850,000

 Elite assigned virtually all rights and interests set forth in the asset purchase agreement to SFL, excluding the lease for the facility and the equipment service agreement. Elite now operates an imaging center at this location.

 3. RECEIVABLE FOR CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION

 In May 2017, the Company sold their imaging center in Jacksonville, Florida to a related party entity through an Asset Purchase Agreement. Part of the purchase consideration under the terms of the sale was contingent consideration payable to SFL (“earn-out”) of $125,000 per month beginning January 2018, payable over seven years, at an amount not to exceed $5,000,000.

 The monthly earn-out payment is contingent upon the imaging center acquired generating EBITDA of $1,800,000, as determined each month end over a trailing twelve month period. SFL recorded the contingent consideration at acquisition date at estimated fair value based on expected future payouts. On the date of sale, the Company estimated that the earn-out payments would be received in full over the four next years (no payment due for first 8 months May to December 2017) and as such, recorded an initial receivable of $3,777,658 for the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration. Fair value was estimated based on the present value of the remaining monthly earn-out payments (28 months as of December 31, 2018), using an interest rate of 13.5%. The fair value of the receivable was $3,035,582 at December 31, 2018 as a result of payments received and the interest income component of the present value computation. Future changes in the estimate of the payout obligation are recorded as a gain or charge to current period earnings.

 4. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE – NET

 Accounts receivable are recorded at established billing rates less allowances for contractual adjustments and uncollectible amounts. Accounts receivable are recorded on the date the diagnostic procedure is performed. At December 31, 2018, in the opinion of management, all accounts were considered collectible and no allowance was deemed necessary. At December 31, 2018, accounts receivable (including the noncurrent portion) were $2,566,115. Gross receivables as reported on the Company’s billing system at December 31, 2018 were approximately $6,200,000.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 4. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE – NET (continued)

 Collections on certain receivables contractually depend on when and if the patient’s case is settled, which generally exceeds one year, and as a result, management has classified 45% of receivables as noncurrent.

 Elite routinely sells its accounts receivable related primarily to MRI scans to various entities without recourse for the purpose of raising working capital. Elite recognizes a loss on these sales based on the negotiated sales price with the various entities. For the year ended December 31, 2018, Elite recorded a loss on sale of accounts receivable in the amount of $5,053,080, of which $3,675,855 was to a related party entity. The agreement to sell accounts receivable to the related party entity was terminated on September 30, 2018.

 5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

 GAAP establishes a framework for measuring fair value. That framework provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. It applies to fair value measurements already required or permitted by existing standards. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).

 The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under GAAP are described as follows:

 Level 1 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the Company has the ability to access. Level 2 Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets. Level 2 inputs include those other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability and that are derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data by correlation or other means. If the asset or liability has a specified term the Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 3 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.

 The asset’s or liability's fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Valuation techniques used should maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. All assets measured by the Company are considered Level 3 assets.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (continued)

 The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value:

 The Company has applied a present value technique over the earn-out term using its own incremental borrowing rate to calculate the fair value of the contingent earn-out receivable. The incremental borrowing rate used was 13.5% as of December 31, 2018. The Company relies on available financial statement data of its investments to evaluate the reasonableness of the fair value of its Level 3 assets.

 The preceding methods described may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, although the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.

 A summary of changes in the fair value of the Company’s Level 3 assets for the year ended December 31, 2018 is as follows:

 Balance at December 31, 2017: $ 4,085,923 Payments received (1,625,000) Change in fair value 574,659

 Balance at December 31, 2018: $ 3,035,582

 6. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT - NET

 Property and equipment consisted of the following at December 31, 2018:


######    Medical equipment Computer equipment Furniture and fixtures Leasehold improvements

 8. INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENT

 The Company has an interest rate swap agreement to hedge against the risk of interest rate increases on the related variable rate debt. The derivative financial instrument is not held for trading purposes and the cash flow effects of the swap arrangement will be included in interest expense as it occurs. Because the swap and related debt agreement were effective November 26, 2018, the effect of the swap for the year ended December 31, 2018 was nominal.

 At December 31, 2018, the interest rate swap agreement consisted of the following:


###### Original Notional Amount


###### Current Notional Interest Rate Amount Cap


###### One-Month LIBOR at December 31, 2018 Net Expiration plus 2.35% Settlement Date


###### $ 1,377,500 $ 1,354,542 5.59% 4.87% (.72)% 11/26/2023

 The hedging contract is classified as a cash flow hedge and accordingly, is adjusted to current market value until the underlying transactions are recognized. The Company has determined fair value through the application of FASB 820-10, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures, using quoted market prices within active markets for similar liabilities (Level 2 inputs). Accordingly the fair value of $26,174 as of December 31, 2018 (initial year of agreement) is recorded as other comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2018. For cash flow purposes, change in fair value loss on the interest rate swap agreement is considered a noncash transaction.

 Because of potential interest rate fluctuations, the Company has exposure to future gains or losses upon ultimate settlement. Management believes that the risk of nonperformance by the counterparty is remote.

 9. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

 Shared Services Agreement

 The Company has a Shared Services Agreement with a related party entity whose Chief Executive Officer is also a managing member of the Company. This agreement, also effective May 1, 2018, subcontracts all of the Company’s responsibilities under the ASA with the related party entity that acquired FCI in May, 2017. Fees paid to the related party entity are $170,000 per month. Fees recorded as expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $1,360,000 and are included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income.

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

**_Nature of Business_**

TIC Acquisition Holdings, LLC (the “Company”) is a Limited Liability Corporation organized in the
state of Florida on January 1, 2018. The Company was organized in connection with the acquisition,
effective January 1, 2018, of all outstanding member ownership interests of Imaging Centers of
West Palm Beach, LLC and Subsidiaries (“ICW”), and certain assets of Imaging Center Management,
Inc., which provided management services to ICW, (see Note 2) (together the “ICW Acquisition”).
The Company owned, operated or managed seven imaging centers throughout Florida as of
December 31, 2018. Imaging services provided by the Company consist of Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (“MRI”) and Radiography (“X-Ray”).

**_Acquisition Method for Business Combinations_**

In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 805, Business Combinations, of
the Financial Accounting Standard Board (“FASB”), assets acquired and liabilities assumed are
recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition. Under the acquisition method, the difference
between the consideration transferred and the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded
either as goodwill or a bargain purchase gain. Acquisition related costs including professional fees
are expensed as incurred. The Company adopted the accounting alternative under ASC 805 effective
January 1, 2018, which allows a private company to limit certain customer-related intangibles it
recognizes separately under ASC 805 and include in goodwill. Under this alternative, private
companies also do not separately recognize noncompetition agreements acquired as part of the
transaction.

**_Fair Value Measurements_**

The Company’s primary financial instruments at December 31, 2018, and for the year then ended,
consisted of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and long-term debt. Fair value is defined
as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value
measurements for assets and liabilities, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous
market in which the Company would transact and the market-based risk measurements or
assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent
risk, transfer restrictions, and credit risk.

U.S. GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques
used to measure fair value into three levels. A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair
value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair
value measurement. The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are:

Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and
liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other
inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the
full term of the assets or liabilities.

Level 3 - Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect the Company’s estimates of
assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.


-----

##### q g,

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

As of December 31, 2018, the fair value of the Company’s financial instruments approximated their
carrying value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The fair value of the Company’s
debt approximates their carrying value based on the short duration and variable interest rates.

**_Basis of Accounting_**

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

**_Principles of Consolidation_**

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been
eliminated upon consolidation.

**_Use of Estimates_**

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Significant estimates made by
management include, but are not limited to, valuation allowances for accounts receivable and
recoverability of carrying amount, and the estimated useful lives, of its long-lived assets. Although
management believes that the Company's assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances,
actual results could differ from those estimates.

**_Intangible assets_**

The trade name finite-lived intangible asset acquired in the ICW Acquisition was initially measured
based on its estimated fair value. The trade name is being amortized on a straight-line basis over
its estimated useful life of 5 years. The Company continually evaluates the reasonableness of the
useful lives of these assets. There was no impairment loss for intangible assets during the year ended
December 31, 2018. See Notes 2 and 5.

**_Goodwill_**

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets in
the ICW Acquisition effective January 1, 2018.

The Company elected the accounting alternative under Topic 350, Intangibles, Goodwill and Other
(“ASC 350”) includes specific reporting disclosure requirements for privately held companies and
allows eligible private companies to amortize goodwill and apply a one-step impairment model.

Goodwill is tested for impairment when a triggering event occurs that indicates that the fair value
of an entity may be below its carrying amount. Such triggering events could include, but are not
limited to, declining overall financial performance or deterioration in general economic conditions.
When a triggering event occurs, management will first assess qualitative factors to determine
whether the quantitative impairment test is necessary. If that qualitative assessment indicates that
it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, management must perform the quantitative test
to compare the entity's fair value with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the qualitative
assessment indicates that it is not more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, further testing is
not necessary.


-----

##### q g,

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Goodwill impairment loss, if any, is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the entity
over its estimated fair value. Management noted no impairment indicators during the period ended
December 31, 2018 or through the date of issuance of these financial statements which would result
in an impairment loss. Adverse changes in operating results and/or unfavorable changes in economic
factors used to estimate fair values could result in a non-cash impairment charge in the future.

**_Risks and Uncertainties_**

The Company is highly dependent on referrals from physicians who have no contractual obligation
or economic incentive to refer patients to the Company’s facilities. The Company is also subject to
various state and federal laws and regulations which prohibit physicians from referring patients to
entities with which they have a financial relationship (an ownership interest or compensation
arrangement) and prohibit the provision of certain medical services by non-physicians and/or the
splitting of fees between physicians and non-physicians. The Company believes its operations are
conducted in material compliance with existing applicable laws.

Approximately 41% of the Company’s scan volume is derived from patient charges billed under the
PIP statutes. This statute has been subjected to legislative scrutiny in recent years and may come
under review again in future legislative sessions. Any significant change to the PIP statutes could
impact future revenues of the Company for its diagnostic imaging services.

**_Regulatory and Other Matters_**

Laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs and healthcare generally are
complex and subject to interpretation. Many of the Company's other payers and provider contracts
are also complex in nature and may be subject to differing interpretations regarding amounts due
for the provision of medical services.

Such differing interpretations may not come to light until a substantial period of time has passed
following contract implementation. Liabilities for claims disputes are recorded when the loss is
probable and can be estimated. Any adjustments to amounts previously recognized are reflected
in the period the change in estimate becomes known.

The healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations of federal, state and local
governments. These laws and regulations include, but are not necessarily limited to, matters such
as licensure, accreditation, and government healthcare program participation requirements,
reimbursement for patient services, and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse. Government
activity has continued with respect to investigations and allegations concerning possible violations
of fraud and abuse statutes and regulations by healthcare providers. Violations of these laws and
regulations could result in expulsion from government healthcare programs together with the
imposition of significant fines and penalties, as well as significant repayments for patient services
previously billed. The Company believes that it is in compliance with fraud and abuse regulations
as well as other applicable government laws and regulations. Compliance with such laws and
regulations can be subject to future government review and interpretation as well as regulatory
actions unknown or unasserted at this time.

The Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) assures health insurance portability,
reduces healthcare fraud and abuse, guarantees security and privacy of health information, and
enforces standards for health information.


-----

##### q g,

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH Act”), along
with certain state rules, expanded upon HIPAA in a number of ways, including establishing
notification requirements for certain breaches of protected health information. The Company
may be subject to significant fines and penalties if found not to be compliant with these state or
federal provisions.

**_Cash_**

The Company maintains cash balances at two financial institutions that are insured under the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (“FDIC”) Transaction Account Guarantee Program. From
time to time, cash balances in these accounts may exceed federally insured limits. The Company
has not experienced any losses on its deposits with financial institutions.

**_Accounts Receivable and Net Patient Service Revenues_**

Patient service revenues and related accounts receivable are recognized on the date diagnostic
imaging services are performed at amounts the Company believes are reasonably assured of being
collected. Charges are recorded at established billing rates and reduced by estimated allowances
for contractual adjustments. Contractual adjustments result from differences between the rates
charged for services performed and reimbursement rates paid by insurance companies, governmentsponsored healthcare programs and other third-party payors. The regulations for governmentsponsored healthcare programs and third-party payor contracts are complex and subject to
interpretation. Allowances for contractual adjustments and uncollectible amounts are based on
estimated historical collection rates, changes in payor mix, specific payor collection issues, changes
in contract pricing and the aging of accounts receivables.

The Company continuously monitors those factors affecting the allowance for contractual
adjustments and collectability of accounts receivable and adjusts amounts as final settlements are
determined and as estimates of future collections change. Adjustments to previous estimates are
recorded as contractual adjustments and reported in the periods that such adjustments become
known.

The Company grants credit without collateral to its patients, most of who are local residents and
are insured by third-party payor agreements. The allowance for uncollectible accounts is
management’s best estimate of the amount of probable losses in accounts receivable, net of the
allowance for contractual adjustments, based on a number of factors, including payor collection
and adjustment history and review of past due balances, with particular emphasis on self-pay past
due accounts greater than 90 days old. The Company writes off account balances against the
allowance for contractual accounts after it exhausts all means of collection and considers the
likelihood of recovery to be remote. The Company adjusts the allowance for uncollectible accounts
as more current information becomes available and such adjustments are recorded in earnings in
the period in which the change in estimate becomes known.

**_Cost of Services_**

Costs of services includes the cost of radiologist services and contracts, MRI technicians, and medical
supplies and expenses.


-----

##### q g,

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

**_Concentration of Credit Risk_**

Accounts receivables included in the consolidated balance sheet consist primarily of amounts from
insurance carriers billed under the Florida Personal Injury Protection (“PIP”) statutes and amounts
billed through Letters of Protection (promises to pay) with attorneys, all in connection with the PIP
statutes. Collections from insurance carriers are based on fee schedules prescribed in the PIP
statutes. Collections from attorneys can take from one month to up seven years or more depending
on when and if the patient’s case is settled.

**_Premises and Equipment_**

Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization,
calculated using a straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Premises and
equipment obtained in connection with business acquisitions are stated at their estimated fair
market value at the date of acquisition. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter
of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset. Upon disposal of property and equipment,
the cost of the assets and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts
and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in earnings.

Maintenance and repairs, which do not improve efficient or extend useful lives, are charged to
operations as incurred. Amortization of assets under capital leases is included in depreciation and
amortization.

Useful lives of premises and equipment are estimated as follows:

Medical equipment 5-7 years
Leasehold improvements 10 years
Computer equipment 3-7 years
Furniture and fixtures 5 years
Office equipment 2-7 years

**_Impairment of Long-lived Assets_**

The Company evaluates its long-lived assets, including finite-lived intangible assets, for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group
may not be recoverable. If facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the
Company’s long-lived assets may not be recoverable, the Company would compare the carrying
amounts to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If
the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is
recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair
value of the asset. There were no events or circumstances identified for the year ended
December 31, 2018 that caused the Company to conclude that long-lived assets should be tested for
impairment.

**_Income taxes_**

The Company and its subsidiaries were formed as limited liability companies and are classified as
pass-through entities for income tax purposes with all income tax liabilities or benefits passed
through to its members. As such, no provision for federal or state income taxes has been recorded
in the consolidated financial statements. Since the Company was organized in 2018, no tax years,
other than 2018, remain open to examination by taxing authorities.


-----

##### q g,

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The Company applies the provisions of ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, which clarifies the accounting
for and reporting of income tax uncertainties, and requires additional disclosures related to
uncertain income tax positions. ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement
attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company has analyzed the positions for its open tax years
in its major jurisdictions and has determined whether or not there are uncertain tax positions that
require financial statement recognition. No reserves for uncertain tax positions were required to
have been recorded at December 31, 2018.

**_Advertising_**

The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense was approximately
$129,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018.

**_New Accounting Pronouncements_**

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).
This guidance provides a five-step process to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The
core principle of the guidance is than an entity should recognize revenue upon transfer of promised
goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the expected consideration to be received
in exchange for those goods or services. This update will also result in enhanced disclosures about
revenue, providing guidance for transactions that were not previously addressed comprehensively,
and improving guidance for multiple-element arrangements. This update is effective for the
Company beginning January 1, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the impact on its
consolidated financial statements of adopting this new guidance.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which supersedes Topic 840,
_Leases. Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize at the commencement date_
for all leases (with the exception of lease terms of 12 months or less for which there is not an option
to purchase the underlying asset): (a) a lease liability, which is a lessee’s obligation to make lease
payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and (b) a right-of-use asset, which
is an asset that represents the lessee’s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the
lease term. The standard was to be effective for the Company on January 1, 2020, with early
application permitted, however, the FASB met in July 2019 and is expected to defer the effective
date until years beginning after December 15, 2020. Lessees (for capital and operating leases) must
apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the
beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The modified
retrospective approach would not require any transition accounting for leases that expired before
the earliest comparative period presented. Lessees may not apply a full retrospective transition
approach. The Company is currently evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial statements
of adopting this new guidance.

 2. Business Combination

Effective January 1, 2018, the Company acquired the membership interests of ICW and located in
West Palm Beach, Florida through a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement. In addition, the
Company acquired Image Center Management, Inc.’s enterprise goodwill as defined in the Enterprise
Goodwill Purchase Agreement. In connection with the purchase, the Company acquired certain
assets and assumed certain liabilities of the selling entity for a purchase price of $17,800,297, which
is net of the working capital adjustment of $199,703. The purchase price was comprised of a
deferred payment obligation of $11,888,425, reinvestment of a portion of a former owner’s
membership interest into membership interest of the Company with a fair value of $2,600,000 and
reinvestment of a portion of the same former owner’s membership interest into preferred capital
with fair value of $831,250, and subordinated loans to the former members (sellers) totaling
$2,668,750, net of an adjustment for working capital and indebtedness. The Company paid the
deferred payment obligation upon the execution of a loan agreement as described in Note 6, Long
Term Debt, and settlement of the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement.

The following table summarizes the allocation of the total purchase consideration at the date of
acquisition:

_January 1, 2018_ **Estimated Fair Value**

Tangible assets acquired:
Cash **$** **197,020**
Accounts receivable **3,750,000**
Other receivable **21,997**
Other current assets **200,358**
Premises and equipment, net **4,400,000**
Other noncurrent assets **73,377**

Total tangible assets acquired **8,642,752**

Liabilities assumed:
Accounts payable **(69,247)**
Accrued expenses **(1,860)**

Assumed liabilities **(71,107)**

Net tangible assets acquired **8,571,645**

Goodwill **8,106,652**
Intangible asset **1,122,000**

Total purchase consideration **$** **17,800,297**

The Company expects recorded goodwill to be non-deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill
attributable to the acquisition has been recorded as a non-current asset and is being amortized over
10 years.

The results of operations of the acquired entities and the estimated fair values of the assets
acquired, and liabilities assumed have been included in the consolidated financial statements since
the date of the acquisition.

##### q g,

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Costs incurred in connection with the acquisition were approximately $593,000 and are included in
the caption “acquisition costs” in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the
year ended December 31, 2018.

###### 3. Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable are recorded at established billing rates less allowances for contractual
adjustments and uncollectible accounts. Accounts receivable are recorded on the date the
diagnostic procedure is performed. At December 31, 2018, the Company recorded an allowance for
