(the “Escrow Issuer”), a newly-formed corporation that is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Akumin Inc., is offering $500,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of    % senior secured notes due 2028 (the “Notes”). The Notes will bear interest at a rate of      % per annum. Interest will be payable on the Notes semi-annually in cash in arrears on and       of each year, beginning on      , 2021. The Notes will mature on      , 2028. We intend to use net proceeds of this offering, as well as the proceeds from the Initial Financing Notes (as defined below), the Financing Common Shares (as defined below) and cash on hand to fund the cash portion of the purchase price for the proposed acquisition (the “Acquisition”) by Akumin Corp. of Alliance HealthCare Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Alliance”). See “Use of Proceeds.” This offering may be consummated prior to the consummation of the Acquisition. If this offering closes prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, the Escrow Issuer will deposit, concurrently with the closing of this offering, the gross proceeds from the sale of the Notes offered hereby into an escrow account plus an amount sufficient to pay interest with respect to the Notes up to, but not including, the then-applicable latest possible Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below). The release of the escrow proceeds will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the consummation of the Acquisition (the “Escrow Release Conditions”). If the Acquisition is not consummated by October 25, 2021 (as such date may be extended as described under “Description of Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,” but no later than January 24, 2022, the ‘‘Outside Date’’), or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption. The special mandatory redemption price will be a price equal to 100% of the initial issue price of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, from the date of initial issuance of the Notes (the ‘‘Issue Date’’) up to, but not including, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Price”). If this offering is consummated prior to the Acquisition, upon the consummation of the Acquisition, the Escrow Issuer will liquidate into Akumin Inc. and, on the liquidation, Akumin Inc. will assume the obligations of Escrow Issuer under the Indenture and the Notes (the “Assumption”). If the closing of the Acquisition (the “Closing”) has occurred at or prior to the time of the consummation of the offering of Notes, we will forego the escrow procedures described in this offering memorandum. See ‘‘Description of Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.’’ The Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, on or after     , 2024 at the redemption prices specified under “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption,” together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but not including, the redemption date. At any time prior to       , 2024, the Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount plus a make-whole premium, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but not including, the redemption date. Up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes may be redeemed at any time prior to        , 2024 with an amount not to exceed the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at the redemption prices set forth in this offering memorandum plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but not including, the redemption date.

If the gross proceeds of the Notes are funded into the escrow account, prior to the satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions, the Notes will not be guaranteed, but will be secured by an exclusive first-priority lien granted by the Escrow Issuer on the funds held in the escrow account. If the gross proceeds of the Notes are not funded into the escrow account or, after the satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions, the obligations under the Notes will be guaranteed (the “guarantees”), jointly and severally, by each of Akumin ----- Credit Facility (as defined below), which, following the consummation of the Acquisition will include Alliance and certain of its subsidiaries. Prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, the Notes will be secured by a first-priority security interest in the funds held in the escrow account at any given time. If the gross proceeds of the Notes are not funded into the escrow account or after the satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions, the Notes and the guarantees will be secured on a first-priority basis by liens on substantially all of Akumin Inc.’s and the guarantors’ tangible and intangible assets (the “Collateral”), subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens, which, following the consummation of the Acquisition will include the assets of Alliance and certain of its subsidiaries. The liens on the Collateral will be equal and ratable, pursuant to the terms of the first lien intercreditor agreement, with the indebtedness under our Revolving Credit Facility and the 2025 Senior Notes. See “Description of Notes—Security”. If the gross proceeds of the Notes are not funded into the escrow account or after the satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions, the Notes and the related guarantees will be Akumin Inc.’s and the guarantors’ senior secured obligations and will rank equally in right of payment with the existing 2025 Senior Notes (as defined herein) and our Revolving Credit Facility and any existing and future senior indebtedness, senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness, and rank equally to any existing and future secured indebtedness of Akumin Inc. and the guarantors secured by the Collateral on a first lien basis, including our Revolving Credit Facility and the existing 2025 Senior Notes, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The Notes and the related guarantees are effectively subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness that is secured by liens on assets that do not constitute a part of the Collateral to the extent of the value of such assets. In addition, the Notes and the guarantees are structurally subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness, claims of holders of preferred stock and other liabilities of any subsidiary of Akumin Inc. that is not a guarantor of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,388

661,Offerings 2021.md,1017,NON-GAAP MEASURES - AKUMIN,1017.1,,1017.1.1,,"This offering memorandum makes reference to certain non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are not recognized measures under GAAP and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Rather, these non-GAAP measures are provided as additional information to complement those GAAP measures by providing further understanding of our results of operations from management’s perspective. Accordingly, these non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of our financial information reported under GAAP. We use non-GAAP financial measures, including “EBITDA”, “Adjusted EBITDA”, “Adjusted EBITDA Normalized for COVID-19” and “Adjusted EBITDA Margin”. These non-GAAP measures are used to provide investors with supplemental measures of our operating performance and thus highlight trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP measures. We believe the use of these non-GAAP measures, along with GAAP financial measures, enhances the understanding of our operating results and is useful to us and to investors in comparing performance with competitors, estimating enterprise value and making investment decisions. We also believe that securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use non-GAAP measures in the evaluation of issuers. Our management also uses non-GAAP measures in order to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period, to prepare annual operating budgets and forecasts and to determine components of management compensation. Such measures do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies, including Alliance. We define such non-GAAP measures as follows: “EBITDA” means net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Akumin before interest expense (net), income tax expense (recovery) and depreciation and amortization. “Adjusted EBITDA” means EBITDA as further adjusted for stock-based compensation, impairment of property and equipment, provisions for certain credit losses, settlement costs, provisions, acquisition-related and public offering costs, gains (losses) in the period and, one-time adjustments. “Adjusted EBITDA Margin” means Adjusted EBITDA divided by the revenue in the period. “Free Cash Flow” means Adjusted EBITDA less cash interest paid and cash capital expenditures. ----- “Adjusted EBITDA Normalized for COVID-19 for Akumin” means Adjusted EBITDA for the LTM period ended March 31, 2021 plus a “COVID-19 Adjustment” of approximately $9 million with respect to Akumin. This amount of this adjustment was estimated by multiplying the incremental RVU volume (as calculated in the last sentence of this definition) of approximately 0.428 million RVUs by: (i) the service fee net revenue per RVU of $42.57 for the LTM period ended March 31, 2021, and (ii) a minimum incremental contribution margin estimated to be approximately 49%. That minimum incremental contribution margin assumes that operating costs for employee compensation, reading fees, medical supplies and other expenses, which together represented 51% of net revenue for the LTM period ended June 30, 2020, are 100% variable and therefore we believe any incremental $1.00 of revenue equates to $0.49 of incremental EBITDA. The incremental RVU volume was determined by annualizing the RVU volume for the three-month period ended March 31, 2021 of approximately 1.515 million RVUs less the actual RVU volume for the LTM period ended March 31, 2021 of approximately 5.632 million RVUs. Adjusted EBITDA Normalized for COVID-19 is a non-GAAP financial measure and has been calculated assuming that our RVU volume of 1.515 million RVUs for the three-month period ended March 31, 2021 applied to each quarter in the four quarter period ended March 31, 2021. There can be no assurance that the RVU volume for the three month period ended March 31, 2021 would have been indicative of the RVU volume for any quarter included in the LTM period ended March 31, 2021 had the COVID-19 pandemic not affected our business and the economy generally. See “Summary – Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information and Other Data” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – How We Assess the Performance of our Business” for a reconciliation of the foregoing non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.",N/A,as_expected,2021,388
661,Offerings 2021.md,1018,NON-GAAP INFORMATION - ALLIANCE,1018.1,“Adjusted EBITDA Normalized for COVID-19 for Alliance” is Adjusted EBITDA for the LTM period ended,1018.1.1,,"March 31, 2021 plus a “COVID-19 Adjustment” of approximately $18 million. This amount of this adjustment was estimated by determining the estimated decrease in scan volumes for MRIs and PET/CT by subtracting the average scan volumes for the twelve months-ended March 31, 2021 from the average scan volumes for the year ended December 31, 2019 and multiplying the average decrease determined by such calculation for each of MRI and PET/CT by the actual revenues per scan for the year ended December 31, 2019 for each of MRI and PET/CT, which resulted in an estimated decrease in revenues of $59 million. The corresponding Adjusted EBITDA amount was determined by multiplying $59 million by the operating margin of 38% for the year ended December 31, 2019 and subtracting approximately $4 million of costs associated with one-time furloughed employee costs.

We expect to generate approximately 52% of our revenue through services provided for health systems and hospitals which are typically under multi-year contracts with either fixed fee or per procedure arrangements. The remaining 48% of our revenue is expected to be billed directly to payors, including commercial payors, Medicare, Medicaid, and other payors. Although 52% of our combined revenue is expected to come directly from hospitals or health systems, the combined company will be an outpatient focused service platform as we expect that substantially all revenues are to be generated from outpatient visits. This focus aligns with the overall shift in the industry to outpatient care.

661,Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.6,Industry Overview,9.6.1,,"_Radiology Overview_ Radiology represents an essential capability of a hospital or health system, driving and influencing many downstream care processes across multiple medical service lines. Radiology services are utilized across virtually all disease categories in early, rapid and accurate detection, diagnosis, treatment planning and monitoring, and directly impact high focus areas such as patient safety, patient experience, length of hospital stay and downstream healthcare resource utilization. Radiology services also play a critical role in providing quality and efficient healthcare, as nearly every individual in the United States will require some form of diagnostic imaging and resulting radiology interpretation for a significant clinical indication during his or her lifetime. As a result of this widespread adoption, healthcare systems across the world and their affiliated physicians rely on efficient and effective radiology operations as well as concise and timely radiologist interpretations to make a fully informed care decisions and to keep their hospital and outpatient operations running smoothly and efficiently. In diagnostic radiology, the typical patient journey includes (i) a referral from a physician, who orders an exam to assist with diagnosing or treating a condition, (ii) the procurement of the diagnostic image, usually carried out by a technologist specialized in the particular procedure or modality, and (iii) an interpretation from a radiologist who reads and interprets the images and produces a report of their findings and recommendations, which is provided back to the referring physician for use in the next step of the patient’s care. The referring physician often consults with the radiologist to choose the appropriate modality, which could include advanced imaging techniques such as MRI, CT, and PET, or routine imaging techniques such as X-Ray, mammography, ultrasound, fluoroscopy, or nuclear medicine. Medical imaging technologies continue to evolve and play a critical role in cost-effective patient diagnosis and treatment. While X-rays are the most common imaging procedure, more sophisticated and higher reimbursement procedures, such as MRI, CT and PET scans are the fastest growing. Radiology exams can be performed at a hospital’s main radiology department or in an outpatient setting, including a hospital outpatient departments, physician offices or independent diagnostic testing facilities. Outpatient diagnostic imaging centers are primarily used to provide medical imaging services to patients who are ambulatory (meaning, they are not in the ER or inpatient) and who have been referred by a third-party physician. Standard offerings include screening and diagnostic imaging procedures such as X-ray, mammography and ultrasound along with more complex and costly services, such as MRI, CT and PET, in addition to other diagnostic and interventional radiology procedures. Outpatient diagnostic imaging is generally more cost effective compared to imaging performed in the traditional inpatient or on-campus hospital setting. We believe that this dynamic, combined with the convenience of outpatient care for patients, will result in outpatient imaging growth outpacing the overall radiology market. The gap in pricing between traditional hospital in-patient facilities and freestanding outpatient facilities has been a significant area of focus for government and third-party payors, who in an effort to curtail costs, have adopted over time a number of policies to drive price transparent, site-neutral reimbursements for advanced outpatient imaging procedures, and steerage to lower-cost, outpatient entities. Payors have also increased requirements for pre-authorization of advanced diagnostic procedures in an effort to ensure the medical necessity of those procedures. We anticipate that these trends will continue to drive procedure volume toward outpatient settings —both freestanding and hospital— outpatient. We believe these trends will drive a need for hospitals and health systems to engage service providers such as the combined company to provide services and support to build their outpatient radiology capabilities. The size of the freestanding outpatient diagnostic imaging market in the United States is estimated at more than $19 billion in annual industry revenue. The diagnostic imaging market is highly competitive, consisting of owneroperator radiologists, freestanding outpatient diagnostic imaging centers, and hospitals. We also face competition from other diagnostic imaging companies in acquiring diagnostic imaging centers. There are estimated to be more than 6,000 freestanding outpatient diagnostic imaging centers in the United States. The landscape in the outpatient ----- diagnostic imaging industry is highly fragmented. Other significant radiology businesses in the United States include RadNet, US Radiology Specialists, SimonMed, RAYUS and MedQuest. We believe the outpatient diagnostic imaging industry will remain stable for the foreseeable future. Contributing to this outlook is the expectation of stable Medicare reimbursement rates. After a downward trend in reimbursement from 2007 to 2014, Medicare reimbursements have generally stabilized. From 2015 to 2020, there has been limited fluctuation in Medicare reimbursements.",N/A,as_expected,2021,388
661,Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.7,"Medicare Fee Schedule Trends (Top 5 MRI CPT Codes, 2000-2020)",9.7.1,,"In addition to a stable Medicare reimbursement outlook, which we believe is often used as a benchmark in the industry, we also believe the industry will see increasing imaging volumes. Since becoming a mainstream medical diagnostic mechanism in the 1990’s, utilization of diagnostic imaging has drastically increased. Over the last few decades, the imaging industry has developed significantly through improvements in technology, the development of various outpatient imaging sites of service, and the continued increase in the number of patients seeking out imaging procedures for both screening and diagnosis. Large outpatient imaging center operators, such as Akumin, are in a position to benefit from these industry dynamics. Scale, reputation and operating excellence will likely be key drivers of performance for the various industry players. There are a number of factors that we believe will drive the growth of the radiology industry, including: - _Aging demographics: The number of people over the age of 65 in the United States is expected to increase significantly, largely owing to the subset of aging baby boomers. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the “65+” population will outnumber individuals under the age of 18 by 2034. As the overall U.S. population continues to age, the need for affordable and easily accessible healthcare procedures will expand proportionally. According to the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) in 2014, senior citizens, defined as those who are 65 years old or older, made up only 13% of the total U.S. population, yet accounted for 34% of healthcare-related spending. The vast growth in the elderly population is expected to positively impact the financial landscape of the overall healthcare industry. - _Greater Consumer Awareness for Earlier Intervention and Preventative Screening: Greater consumer awareness for early intervention and increased emphasis on preventive screening have changed the perception of imaging from a luxury service to an essential part of the diagnostic process. Commercial ----- payors are encouraging the appropriate use of diagnostic imaging and of preventative screenings to help decrease overall costs by reducing more expensive procedures over the long-run. - _Technological Advances Leading to More Use Cases for Radiology: We believe that further technological advancements will allow for even earlier diagnosis of diseases and disorders through less invasive methods, further driving demand for diagnostic imaging services. Additionally, the industry is seeing a shift towards the adoption of innovative technology in areas such as Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) which has the potential to transform diagnostic imaging and help with early diagnosis. _Oncology Overview_ Radiation therapy is the practice of delivering ionizing radiation to treat malignant and benign disease processes under the direction of a radiation oncologist. Radiation therapy is primarily used to treat cancer patients, as it kills cancer cells and shrink tumors via the highest possible dose of radiation, in order to destroy the cancerous cells while minimizing exposure to healthy surrounding tissue. Alliance specializes in the deployment and utilization of two primary radiation therapy modalities: Linac and targeted, robotic linear accelerators (“SRS”). Both are utilized to treat the most common and some of the most deadly cancers in the U.S., including breast, lung, prostate, colon, melanoma and brain cancer. Linac can perform different types of treatments, including conventional, intensity-modulated and stereotactic body radiation therapies via treatments that are often lower doses over more sessions and weeks. Some Linacs can provide stereotactic radiosurgery as well. SRS is specifically designed to treat tumors using stereotactic radiosurgery, which delivers higher doses and shorter course treatments given over several days. Demand for cancer care is large and growing. Radiation therapy services are essential to cancer care, with approximately 66% of cancer patients receiving radiation therapy as a part of their cancer care. As a result, the radiation therapy market is significant, with an estimated size of $3 billion and annual growth estimated in the midsingle-digits. There are more than 2,300 radiation therapy centers across the country. Radiation therapy treatment relies on the execution of technical services coordinated with professional physician and clinician services. There are a number of highly trained professionals involved in the workflow. Care is led by the radiation oncologist, a specially trained physician who works with other physicians and the full radiation therapy staff to oversee each patient’s treatment and coordinates the most appropriate radiation therapy approach for each patient. The medical physicist assures the accurate delivery of all aspects of treatment, oversees dosimetrists, and ensures that treatments are properly planned specifically for each patient. The dosimetrist designs the treatment plan (including dose distributions and calculations) for a prescribed course of therapy. This includes all specific dose calculations for each patient. The radiation therapist administers radiation therapy to patients via the specified equipment and monitors the patient during treatment. The radiation oncology nurse works with the patient and care team to provide support, care and resources before, during and after treatment. The center staff are team members who support clinical care and operations, which can include front desk staff, site administrators, navigators and others. There are a number of different Medicare payment methodologies for radiation therapy based on the site of service. Sites operating as an integrated department of the hospital are reimbursed under the Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (“HOPPS”). Freestanding outpatient radiation therapy providers are reimbursed under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (“MPFS”). Reimbursement rates are typically higher for procedures performed at a hospital outpatient department (“HOPD”), which are off-campus outpatient centers that are clinically and financially integrated with the hospital. In recent years, there has been a shift towards site-neutral payments by lowering payments to HOPDs. In the 2019 final rule, CMS set reimbursement rates for certain HOPD centers equal to 40% of HOPPS beginning in 2020, with an exception for certain HOPD centers that billed under HOPPS prior to November 2, 2015. The oncology segment of the combined company will derive revenue from both HOPPS and MPFS. Approximately two-thirds of revenue is billed to the health system or hospital partner under contractual arrangements and the ----- remaining one-third of revenue is billed directly to the payor. For sites that are contracted with hospitals or health systems, the majority of centers fall under HOPPS. These centers are not subject to some of the recent developments related to despite the shift to site neutrality, since these centers have either been “grandfathered in” (have been billing under HOPPS since prior to 2015) or are located on the hospital property. For sites that bill payors directly, the vast majority of sites bill under MPFS. Radiation therapy reimbursement has generally remained stable across both Akumin’s and Alliance’s key areas of service, while site neutrality rules are expected to have minimal impact. Below are the changes in HOPPS and MPFS reimbursement rates for the last several years. In December 2015, Congress passed the Patient Access and Medicare Protection Act, which sought to develop an episodic alternative payment model for radiation therapy services. This resulted in the Radiation Oncology (“RO”) model, which aims to improve the quality of care for patients while moving towards a simplified and predictable payment system. The program is expected to go into effect on January 1, 2022 and cover periods through December 2025 for a select set of geographies and 16 disease states representing approximately 30% of eligible episodes. The model will reimburse providers based on prospective, site neutral, episode-based payments for 90-day episodes. Participants will be paid in two installments per episode (beginning and end) with reimbursement split into professional (fee for physician services) and technical components (fee for use of the facility). The program also includes the reporting of performance on quality measures, clinical data, and patient experience, which will be factored into payments. We believe that our focus on clinical quality, operational efficiency, and value-based care, as well as our integrated service line approach, position us well for the new reimbursement model.",N/A,as_expected,2021,388

The combined company’s brand will be defined by intentional engagement with critical decision makers, including a consistent focus on the consumer (including current or future patients, as well as patients’ loved ones). The consumer is at the heart of our strategy as increasing out of pocket costs, price transparency and access to sophisticated medical information online are changing consumer behavior in healthcare services. This is evidenced by the emergence of high deductible health plans. The percentage of U.S. workers enrolled in high deductible plans with a health savings account increased from approximately 4% in 2007 to approximately 32% in 2019. Our commitment to outreach, compassionate care, operational excellence and service delivery optimizes the consumer’s experience at our clinics. ----- We provide a consistent patient experience, standardized through technology and investments in our people and processes. All patient facing employees are trained on delivering our brand promises by way of our intentional values, as well as our policies and procedures. Our brand strategy is focused on aligning our position in the market for the needs of our patients and partners, so that we are the go-to provider of outpatient diagnostic imaging and/or radiation therapy services to patients in our service areas. We strive to provide shorter waiting times, convenient locations, competitive pricing, compassionate and high-quality clinical care, quality equipment and software, concise interpretations by subspecialty radiologists and top-tier expertise and consistency.",N/A,as_expected,2021,388
661,Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.9,Business Strategy,9.9.1,Continued strong organic volume growth,"Our organic growth strategy is based on a sales and marketing platform which utilizes relationships with local referring physicians and consumer engagement to drive new business. To ensure the continued strength of relationships with referring physicians, we employ a field-based sales team whose primary responsibility is establishing new relationships and maintaining existing relationships with referring physicians. Relationships with new referring physicians are developed through our value proposition (i.e. consistent service, excellent patient care and referring provider communications, contracts with substantially all payors, convenience and access to top subspecialty radiologists and radiation oncologists). Existing relationships are maintained by ensuring we continue to deliver our value proposition in a consistent manner. We stress the importance of operational excellence which ultimately manifests itself in a better patient experience. To ensure continuous engagement with the community — including consumers, patients and their loved ones — we deploy a number of market-specific, direct-to-consumer marketing and communications strategies, focused largely on digital outreach (e.g., websites, search engine optimization, online reputation management, digital advertising and social media) and addressing consumers’ most critical questions: how to decide, what to expect, how to prepare, what they will pay and what will happen next. Our marketing strategies and tactics are coordinated through centralized resources with expertise in specific areas and on a shared platform to ensure compliance with healthcare marketing regulations. Within our radiology segment, in markets with robust demand, we will consider adding modalities in centers that are currently only single or dual modality centers. Multi-modality centers help diversify risk while contributing positively to our margins and provide referring physicians with a “one-stop shop” for their patients. To attain growth and offer a competitive differentiator in key markets, we will also consider replacing or adding new technologies and equipment. While reimbursement rates may not change with newer equipment, we believe this strategy, in particularly competitive markets, will offer us a market advantage which will ultimately lead to increased volumes. An example of this is our investment in 3D digital mammography, which is preferred by many women (who can self-refer for mammography) and is now being reimbursed by many of the large national insurance payors in addition to Medicare. The table below shows year-over-year RVU growth for Akumin on a same-center basis excluding the 2020 Acquisitions (as defined below) and the 2019 Acquisitions (as defined below), except for the acquisition of a single outpatient diagnostic imaging center in Davie, Florida and pro-rating for the acquisition of single outpatient diagnostic imaging center in Deltona, Florida and the ADG Acquisitions (each as defined below). -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,388

These non-GAAP measures are not recognized measures under GAAP and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Rather, these non-GAAP measures are provided as additional information to complement our GAAP measures by providing further understanding of our results of operations from management’s perspective. Accordingly, these non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of our financial information reported under GAAP. We use non-GAAP financial measures, including “EBITDA”, “Adjusted EBITDA”, “Adjusted EBITDA Margin”, “Adjusted EBITDA Normalized for COVID-19” and “Free Cash Flow”. These non-GAAP measures are used to provide investors with supplemental measures of our operating performance and thus highlight trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP measures. We believe the use of these non-GAAP measures, along with GAAP financial measures, enhances the understanding of our operating results and is useful to us and to investors in comparing performance with competitors, estimating enterprise value and making investment decisions. We also believe that securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use non-GAAP measures in the evaluation of issuers. Our management also uses non-GAAP measures in order to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period, to prepare annual operating budgets and forecasts and to determine components of management compensation. In addition, these non-GAAP measures should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other performance measures in accordance with GAAP. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,388

This amount of this adjustment was estimated by multiplying the incremental RVU volume (as calculated in the last sentence of this definition) of approximately 0.428 million RVUs by: (i) the service fee net revenue per RVU of $42.57 for the LTM period ended March 31, 2021, and (ii) a minimum incremental contribution margin estimated to be approximately 49%. That minimum incremental contribution margin assumes that operating costs for employee compensation, reading fees, medical supplies and other expenses, which together represented 51% of net revenue for the LTM period ended June 30, 2020, are 100% variable and therefore we believe any incremental $1.00 of revenue equates to $0.49 of incremental EBITDA. The incremental RVU volume was determined by annualizing the RVU volume for the three-month period ended March 31, 2021 of approximately 1.515 million RVUs less the actual RVU volume for the LTM period ended March 31, 2021 of approximately 5.632 million RVUs. Adjusted EBITDA Normalized for COVID-19 is a non-GAAP financial measure and has been calculated assuming that our RVU volume of 1.515 million RVUs for the three-month period ended March 31, 2021 applied to each quarter in the four quarter period ended March 31, 2021. There can be no assurance that the RVU volume for the three month period ended March 31, 2021 would have been indicative of the RVU volume for any quarter included in the LTM period ended March 31, 2021 had the COVID-19 pandemic not affected our business and the economy generally.

This amount of this adjustment was estimated by determining the estimated decrease in scan volumes for MRIs and PET/CT by subtracting the average scan volumes for the twelve monthsended March 31, 2021 from the average scan volumes for the year ended December 31, 2019 and multiplying the average decrease determined by such calculation for each of MRI and PET/CT by the actual revenues per scan for the year ended December 31, 2019 for each of MRI and PET/CT, which resulted in an estimated decrease in revenues of $59 million. The corresponding Adjusted EBITDA amount was determined by multiplying $59 million by the operating margin of 38% for the year ended December 31, 2019 and subtracting approximately $4 million of costs associated with one-time furloughed employee costs. There can be no assurance that average scan volume for the year ended December 31, 2019 would have been indicative of the average scan volumes for any quarter included in the LTM period ended March 31, 2021 had the COVID-19 pandemic not affected our business and the economy generally.

See “Summary – Recent Developments – Tuck-in Acquisitions.” For Alliance represents deductions to Adjusted EBITDA equal to (i) $8.9 million resulting from discontinued operations and the sale of certain legal entities and business units in 2020 and since the end of the year ended December 31, 2020, including the sale of Alliance’s Interventional Division. and (ii) $7.4 million resulting from Alliance suspending its management incentive compensation plan (“MIP”) in 2020 as the result of the COVID-19 pandemic, had the MIP been paid at 100% of target there would have been an $7.4 million incremental expense after minority interest in the year ended December 31, 2020.

Alliance believes, in addition to GAAP metrics, this non-GAAP metric is a useful measure for investors for a variety of reasons. Alliance’s management regularly communicates Adjusted EBITDA and their interpretation of such results to its Board. Alliance also compares actual periodic Adjusted EBITDA against internal targets as a key factor in determining cash incentive compensation for executives and other employees, largely because it views Adjusted EBITDA results as indicative of how its Radiology and Oncology businesses are performing and being managed. Alliance defines Adjusted EBITDA as net loss attributable to Alliance HealthCare Services, Inc. before: income taxes; net income attributable to non-controlling interest; interest expense, net; depreciation expense; amortization expense; transaction costs; restructuring charges; impairment charges; severance and related costs; loss on extinguishment or modification of debt; legal matters and other expenses; share-based compensation; and other charges (benefits), net. The presentation of a non-GAAP metric does not imply that the reconciling items presented are non-recurring, infrequent or unusual. In general, non-GAAP metrics have certain limitations as analytical financial measures and are used in conjunction with GAAP results to evaluate operating performance and by considering independently the economic effects of the items that are or are not reflected in non-GAAP metrics. Alliance compensates for such limitations by providing GAAP-based disclosures concerning the excluded items in our financial disclosures. As a result of these limitations, and because non-GAAP metrics may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, the non-GAAP metrics are not an alternative to the most directly comparable GAAP measure or any other GAAP measure of operating performance.

We will pay higher interest rates on the Financing Notes in comparison to our other indebtedness. Additionally, we have the right under the Financing Notes to elect to pay interest in-kind in the form of additional Financing Notes (“PIK”) for the first two years from the issuance of such Financing Notes.

Furthermore, if we are subject to a change of control for purposes of the Financing Notes, we may voluntarily repurchase or be required to repurchase the Financing Notes at a higher price than we will be required to make with respect to the 2025 Senior Notes or the Notes. The Financing Notes will restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness in excess of a total leverage ratio of 4.5:1.0, so our ability to raise capital in the future may be limited.

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19, a disease caused by this novel coronavirus, a pandemic. This disease continues to spread throughout the United States and other parts of the world. The COVID-19 pandemic is significantly affecting our employees, patients, facilities, communities and business operations, as well as the U.S. and Canadian economy and financial markets. As the COVID-19 crisis continues to evolve, the full extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak will impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted. For example, we are not able to predict or control the severity or duration of the pandemic, including whether there will be additional periods of increases in the number of COVID-19 cases in areas in which we operate, the timing and availability of effective medical treatments and vaccines or the efficacy of public health controls. At this stage, we have no certainty as to how long the pandemic, or a more limited epidemic, will last, what regions will be most affected or to what extent containment measures will be applied. Imaging and oncology centers are healthcare facilities and as such are generally considered an essential service and expected to continue to operate during any epidemic or pandemic. However, there is potential that actions taken by government, or referring physicians or individual actions, in response to containment or avoidance of this coronavirus could impact a patient’s ability or decision to seek medical services at a given time which could have a significant impact on volume at our centers leading to temporary or prolonged staff layoffs, reduced hours, closures and other cost containment efforts. Further, there is potential that certain services which are not urgent and can be deferred without significant harm to a patient’s health may be delayed, either by us in response to local laws or good public health practice or voluntarily by the patient. In addition, there is potential that the outbreak of the coronavirus could impact supply chains, including our supply of personal protective equipment, and lead to personnel shortages, each of which could impact our ability to safely perform imaging and oncology services. It is also possible that social distancing efforts and sanitization and decontamination procedures could cause delays in the performance of imaging and oncology services. Depending on the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is potential for us to incur incremental credit losses beyond what is currently expected and potential reduction in revenue and income and asset impairments. We face various risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks, including the global outbreak of COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic, changes in patient behavior related to illness, pandemic fears and market downturns, and restrictions intended to slow the spread of COVID-19, including quarantines, government-mandated actions, stay-at-home orders and other restrictions, have led to disruption of our business and volatility in the global capital markets. The United States government has taken steps to attempt to mitigate some of the more severe anticipated economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the passage of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”). Additionally, we have received certain funding and other relief under the CARES Act, as described more fully herein. Nonetheless, no assurance that such types of measures and funding whether already enacted or to be enacted will be effective or achieve their desired results in a timely fashion, including as it relates to our business operations. Moreover, while we believe we are in compliance with the applicable terms and conditions of funding under the CARES Act, compliance-related guidance for the program remains in process, and we may face enforcement risk if we are found to have failed to comply with such terms and conditions. If significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including because of illness, quarantines, facility closures, ineffective remote work arrangements, supply chain disruptions or technology failures or limitations, our operations would be adversely impacted. We have already incurred and will continue to incur additional costs related to protecting the health and well-being and meeting the needs of our patients, employees, medical staff members and contractors. We expect to continue to incur additional costs, which may be significant, as we continue to implement operational changes in response to this pandemic. We may also face liability to the extent we receive claims from our employees, customers or related third-parties alleging exposure to COVID-19 in connection with our operations or at one of our facilities. In addition, we may be subject to a governmental enforcement action if we fail to comply with applicable health and safety regulations. ----- Our results of operations have been and will be negatively impacted by these developments. In addition, changes to statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies or practices as a result of, or in response to COVID-19, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. Although social contact restrictions have eased across the U.S. and most states have lifted moratoriums on non-emergent procedures, some restrictions remain in place, and some states are reimposing certain restrictions due to increasing rates of COVID-19 cases. Further, additional closings and restrictions on hours and services may occur for an unpredictable amount of time. In particular, we have significant operations in geographies that are deemed “hot spots” such as Florida and Texas, two of our major markets, that continue to experience increases in COVID-19 infections. Due to the concentration of our facilities in Texas and Florida, we are particularly sensitive to the increase in COVID-19 cases in those states, where the pandemic could have a disproportionate effect on our business. Given the many uncertainties and far reaching consequences of potential developments, we cannot ensure that the COVID-19 outbreak and the many related impacts will not require extended or additional imaging center closures and other disruptions to our business or will not materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition in the period beyond March 31, 2021. Broad economic factors resulting from the current COVID-19 pandemic, including high unemployment and underemployment rates and reduced consumer spending and confidence, also affect our service mix, revenue mix payor mix and patient volumes, as well as our ability to collect outstanding receivables. Business closings and layoffs in the areas where we operate may lead to increases in the uninsured and underinsured populations and adversely affect demand for our services, as well as the ability of patients and other payors to pay for services rendered. Any increase in the amount or deterioration in the collectability of patient accounts receivable will adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations, requiring an increased level of working capital. In addition, our results and financial condition may be adversely affected by federal, state or local laws, regulations, orders, or other governmental or regulatory actions addressing the current COVID-19 pandemic or the U.S. health care system, which could result in direct or indirect restrictions to our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.",N/A,as_expected,2021,388

Accordingly, we will be dependent upon our ability to enter into acquisition agreements that we believe are consistent with our business strategy. Risks in acquiring new outpatient diagnostic imaging and oncology centers include: (a) our ability to locate new centers that are attractive and complement our business; and (b) our ability to acquire these centers at attractive acquisition prices. We also face competition from other outpatient diagnostic imaging companies and oncology providers in acquiring outpatient diagnostic imaging and oncology centers, which makes it more difficult to find attractive products on acceptable terms. Accordingly, we may not be able to acquire rights to additional outpatient diagnostic imaging and oncology centers on acceptable terms, if at all. Further, we may not be able to obtain future financing for new acquisitions on acceptable terms, if at all or obtain consent of Stonepeak under the Financing Notes.

We compete principally on the basis of our reputation, our ability to provide multiple modalities at many of our centers, the location of our centers and the quality of our outpatient diagnostic imaging and oncology services. We compete locally with groups of radiologists, established hospitals, clinics and other independent organizations that own and operate imaging equipment. Our competitors include, among others: Radnet, Inc., SimonMed Imaging LLC and InSight Health Services Corp. Some of our competitors may now or in the future have access to greater financial resources than we do and may have access to newer, more advanced equipment. In addition, some physician practices have established their own outpatient diagnostic imaging and oncology centers within their group practices and compete with us.

We may experience increased competition that limits our ability to expand our business. We may not be able to capitalize on expected business opportunities, assumptions underlying estimates of expected cost savings may be inaccurate, or general industry and business conditions may deteriorate. In addition, integrating operations will require significant efforts and expenses on our part. Personnel may leave or be terminated because of an acquisition. Our management may have its attention diverted while trying to integrate an acquisition. If these factors limit our ability to integrate the operations of an acquisition successfully or on a timely basis, our expectations of future results of operations, including certain cost savings and synergies as a result of the acquisition, may not be met. In addition, our growth and operating strategies for a target’s business may be different from the strategies that the target company pursued prior to our acquisition.

We derive substantially all of our net revenue, directly or indirectly, from fees charged for the diagnostic imaging and oncology services performed at our centers. We depend on referrals of patients from unaffiliated physicians and other third parties who have no contractual obligations to refer patients to us for a substantial portion of the services we perform. If a sufficiently large number of these physicians and other third parties were to discontinue referring patients to us, including in connection with voluntary or involuntary closures of physician offices in connection with the current, ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or the delay of other elective procedures for which our imaging services are required, our scan volume could decrease, which would reduce our net revenue and operating margins. Further, commercial third-party payors have implemented programs that could limit the ability of physicians to refer patients to us. For example, prepaid healthcare plans, such as health maintenance organizations, sometimes contract directly with providers and require their enrollees to obtain these services exclusively from those providers. Some insurance companies and self-insured employers also limit these services to contracted providers. These “closed panel” systems are now common in the managed care environment. Other systems create an economic disincentive for referrals to providers outside the system’s designated panel of providers.

Healthcare providers participating in managed care plans may be required to refer diagnostic imaging tests or oncology services to certain providers depending on the plan in which a covered patient is enrolled. In addition, managed care contracting has become very competitive, and reimbursement schedules are at or below Medicare reimbursement levels. The expansion of health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations and other managed care organizations within the geographic areas covered by our network could have a negative impact on the utilization and pricing of our services, because these organizations will exert greater control over patients’ access to diagnostic imaging services, the selections of the provider of such services and reimbursement rates for those services.",N/A,as_expected,2021,388

Governmental investigations, as well as qui tam lawsuits, may lead to significant fines, penalties, settlements or other sanctions, including exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs. We are and have been subject to civil investigative demands and investigations from time to time regarding our compliance with physician supervision requirements for MRI procedures and other diagnostic imaging tests, as well as our sales and marketing practices and financial arrangements with physicians.

New privacy legislation may create additional rights for consumers and impose additional requirements on businesses. As these laws and regulations increase in complexity and number, they may change frequently, sometimes conflict and increase our compliance efforts, costs and risks. If we fail to comply with applicable privacy and security laws, regulations and standards, properly maintain the integrity of our data, protect our proprietary rights to our systems, or defend against cybersecurity attacks, our business, reputation, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. HIPAA establishes a set of national privacy and security standards for the protection of protected health information, or PHI, by health plans, health care clearinghouses and certain health care providers, or “covered entities,” and their “business associates,” which are persons or entities that perform certain services for, or on behalf of, a covered entity that involve creating, receiving, maintaining or transmitting PHI. We are a covered entity under HIPAA and therefore must comply with its requirements to protect the privacy and security of health information and must provide individuals with certain rights with respect to their health information. If we engage a business associate to assist us in carrying out our health care operations, we must have a written business associate contract or other arrangement with the business associate that establishes specifically what the business associate has been engaged to do and requires the business associate to comply with the same requirements. Penalties for violations of these laws vary. For instance, a single breach incident can result in findings of violations of multiple HIPAA provisions. Penalties for failure to comply with a requirement of HIPAA vary significantly, and include civil monetary penalties for each provision of HIPAA that is violated and, in certain circumstances, criminal ----- penalties, including imprisonment and/or additional fines. A person who knowingly obtains or discloses individually identifiable health information in violation of HIPAA may face additional fines and up to one-year imprisonment. The criminal penalties increase if the wrongful conduct involves false pretenses or the intent to sell, transfer, or use identifiable health information for commercial advantage, personal gain, or malicious harm. We have from time to time been subject to investigations by the Office for Civil Rights with respect to our HIPAA compliance. Responding to government investigations regarding alleged violations of these and other laws and regulations, even if ultimately concluded with no findings of violations or no penalties imposed, can consume company resources and impact our business and, if public, harm our reputation. State attorneys general also have the right to prosecute HIPAA violations committed against residents of their states. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action that would allow individuals to sue in civil court for HIPAA violations, its standards have been used as the basis for the duty of care in state civil suits, such as those for negligence or recklessness in misusing individuals’ health information. Even when HIPAA does not apply, according to the Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure may constitute unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act (the “FTC Act”). The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Individually identifiable health information is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards. Certain states have also adopted comparable privacy and security laws and regulations, some of which may be more stringent than HIPAA. Such laws and regulations will be subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities, thus creating potentially complex compliance issues for us. Further, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or the CCPA, on June 28, 2018, which went into effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. Although there are limited exemptions for health-related information, including PHI maintained by a covered entity or a business associate, the CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Some observers have noted that the CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States, which could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business. Similar laws have been proposed in other states and at the federal level, and if passed, such laws may have potentially conflicting requirements that would make compliance challenging. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”), recently passed in California. The CPRA will impose additional data protection obligations on covered businesses, including additional consumer rights processes, limitations on data uses, new audit requirements for higher risk data, and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It will also create a new California data protection agency authorized to issue substantive regulations and could result in increased privacy and information security enforcement. The majority of the provisions will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and additional compliance investment and potential business process changes may be required. Compliance with applicable data privacy and security laws, rules and regulations could require us to engage in costly compliance exercises, restrict our ability to collect, or use and disclose data. Each of these constantly evolving laws can be subject to varying interpretations. Failure to comply with U.S. data protection laws and regulations could result in government investigations and enforcement actions (which could include civil or criminal penalties), fines, private litigation, and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business. Moreover, patients about whom we obtain information may contractually limit our ability to use and disclose the information. Claims that we have violated individuals’ privacy rights, failed to comply with data protection laws, or breached our contractual obligations, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business.",N/A,as_expected,2021,388

Our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential, proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks. Despite the implementation of security measures, our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to privacy and security incidents, cyberattacks, acts of vandalism or theft, computer viruses, coordinated attacks by activist entities, emerging cybersecurity risks, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other similar events that could result in unauthorized access to, use or disclosure of, corruption of, or loss of sensitive and/or proprietary data, including personal information or PHI. Emerging and advanced security threats, including coordinated attacks, require additional layers of security which may disrupt or impact efficiency of operations. Attacks upon information technology systems are increasing in their frequency, levels of persistence, sophistication and intensity, and are being conducted by sophisticated and organized groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may also face increased cybersecurity risks due to our reliance on internet technology and the number of our employees who are working remotely, which may create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities. Furthermore, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or to sabotage, systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. We may also experience security breaches that may remain undetected for an extended period. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our business operations. In addition, such a breach may require notification to governmental agencies, the media or individuals pursuant to various federal and state privacy and security laws, if applicable, including HIPAA, as well as regulations promulgated by the FTC and state breach notification laws. We would also be exposed to a risk of loss, including financial assets or litigation and potential liability, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability. Our insurance policies may not be adequate to compensate us for the potential losses arising from such disruptions, failure, or security breach.

For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “ACA”) was signed into law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States. Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional efforts to modify or repeal the ACA. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision that entered into effect on January 1, 2019, that repealed the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” In December 2018, a U.S. district court held that the individual mandate was unconstitutional, which was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the case without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. In addition, there have been other legislative changes proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, resulted in reductions in payments to Medicare providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021, unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced CMS payments to several providers, including hospitals, further increased the presumed utilization of advanced diagnostic imaging and oncology services to a presumed rate of 90%, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover Medicare overpayments to providers from three to five years. Furthermore, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which hospitals and other healthcare providers set their charges, which has resulted in proposed and enacted regulations designed to bring transparency to charges and reduce the cost of products and services. The failure to comply with transparency laws can result in significant penalties. We cannot predict which healthcare reform measures will be implemented or the full impact of current or future healthcare reform measures on our business. While we are unable to predict what, if any, changes may ultimately be enacted, the U.S. Congressional Budget Office and others have estimated that some of the proposals made to date would result in millions of additional uninsured patients in the U.S. Additionally, U.S. lawmakers have suggested that, even if no formal legislation repealing or modifying the ACA is passed, they may take, or omit, actions that could adversely impact the viability of the ACA and the health insurance markets, which could result in more uninsured patients, other patients having lesser coverage or patients having to absorb a greater portion of the cost of their health care services.

In addition, freestanding diagnostic imaging centers that provide services independent of a physician’s office must be enrolled by Medicare as an independent diagnostic treatment facility, or IDTF, to bill the Medicare program. Medicare carriers have discretion in applying the IDTF requirements and therefore the application of these requirements may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

Medicare reimbursement rates are subject to annual updates, which can result in significant reimbursement cuts and changes to coverage criteria. Changes to Medicare reimbursement rates for outpatient services provided by our hospital partners can negatively impact the contractual fees that we can charge for our services.

Any negative changes in governmental capitation or fee-for-service rates or methods of reimbursement for the services we provide could have a significant adverse impact on our revenue and financial results. Generally, commercial insurance companies reimburse us, directly or indirectly, including through the contracted radiology groups elsewhere, on the basis of agreed upon rates. These rates are negotiated and may differ materially with rates set forth in the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule for the particular service. The patients may be responsible for certain co-payments or deductibles. Government and private payors have taken and may continue to take steps to control the cost, eligibility for, use, and delivery of healthcare services, including diagnostic imaging and oncology services, as a result of budgetary constraints, cost containment pressures and other reasons. For example, reimbursement by government payors for a ----- number of diagnostic imaging procedures, including many that we or our managed radiology practices perform, has been materially reduced over the last number of years. Certain private payors have followed suit and reduced reimbursement for certain diagnostic imaging procedures. Given the recent history, we expect that reimbursement for certain diagnostic imaging services that we or our managed radiology practices provide, may be reduced in the future, which would adversely impact our business. Additionally, CMS and other payors are seeking to shift from a primarily fee for service reimbursement paradigm to a more value based model. We cannot predict what such changes will ultimately look like or how they may ultimately impact our business or financial performance, which creates significant uncertainty for our business.",N/A,as_expected,2021,388

Compliance with applicable securities laws in Canada and the U.S. and the rules of the Toronto Stock Exchange (the “TSX”) and The Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) substantially increases our expenses, including our legal and accounting costs, and makes some activities more time-consuming and costly. Reporting obligations as a public company and our anticipated growth may place a strain on our financial and management systems, processes and controls, as well as our personnel. We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, which is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Because of our inherent limitations and the fact that we are a public company and are implementing additional financial control and management systems, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. A failure to prevent or detect errors or misstatements may result in a material impact on our financial position, liquidity, and results of operations. If our management is unable to certify the effectiveness of our internal controls or if material weaknesses in our internal controls are identified, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence, which could have a material impact on our financial position, liquidity, and results of operations. In addition, if we do not maintain adequate financial and management personnel, processes and controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis, which could have a material impact on our financial position, liquidity, and results of operations. We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error or fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and implemented, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues within an organization are detected. The inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Controls can also be circumvented by individual acts of certain persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. Due to the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, ----- misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected in a timely manner or at all. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results could be materially adversely effected, which could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which in turn could have a material impact on our financial position, liquidity and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,388

Under the agreements governing our indebtedness, we may incur additional indebtedness under the credit facilities, through the issuance of notes, term loans or otherwise in the future. We are exposed to changes in interest rates on our cash, bank indebtedness and long-term debt. Debt issued at variable rates exposes us to cash flow interest rate risk. Debt issued at fixed rates exposes us to fair value interest rate risk. Our borrowings, current and future, will require interest payments and need to be repaid or refinanced, could require us to divert funds identified for other purposes to debt service and could create additional cash demands or impair our liquidity position and add financial risk for us. Diverting funds identified for other purposes for debt service may adversely affect our business and growth prospects. If we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt, we may need to refinance our debt, dispose of assets, reduce or delay expenditures or issue equity to obtain necessary funds. We do not know whether we would be able to take any of these actions on a timely basis, on terms satisfactory to us, or at all. Our level of indebtedness could affect our operations in several ways, including the following: - a significant portion of our cash flows could be used to service our indebtedness; - the covenants contained in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness may limit our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets, pay dividends and make certain investments; - our debt covenants may also affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in the economy and in our industry; - a high level of debt would increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; - a high level of debt may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged and therefore may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our indebtedness would prevent us from pursuing; and - a high level of debt may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions or other purposes.

By its nature, portions of the Collateral may be illiquid or intangible and may have no readily ascertainable market value.

In addition, the security interest of the notes collateral agent is subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in Collateral. For example, the notes collateral agent may need to make additional filings and obtain the consent of a third party to obtain or enforce a security interest in a contract, and the notes collateral agent has no obligation to make such filings. We cannot assure you that the notes collateral agent ----- will be able to make these filings or obtain any such consent on a timely basis or at all.

Therefore, the practical value of realizing on the Collateral may, without the appropriate consents and filings, be limited. Also, certain items included in the Collateral may not be transferable (by their terms or pursuant to applicable law) and therefore the notes collateral agent may not be able to realize value from such items in the event of a foreclosure.

In addition, under the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, if at any time the controlling collateral agent under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any resulting in a sale thereof, the lien securing the Notes on such Collateral will be automatically released and discharged (provided that any proceeds from such sale are applied ratably among all the then outstanding first-priority obligations secured on a first priority basis by the Collateral).

To the extent that liens securing obligations under our Revolving Credit Facility, the 2025 Senior Notes, pre-existing liens, liens permitted under the indenture and other rights, including liens on excluded assets, such as those securing purchase money obligations and capital lease obligations granted to other parties (in addition to the holders of any other obligations secured by higher priority liens to the extent permitted under the indenture), encumber any of the Collateral securing the Notes and the guarantees, those parties may have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral that could adversely affect the value of the Collateral and the ability of the notes collateral agent, the trustee under the indenture or the holders of the Notes to realize or foreclose on the Collateral. By accepting a note, you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions and will be deemed to have authorized the notes collateral agent and the trustee to execute and deliver the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes may not be able to act quickly or at all to have the notes collateral agent realize on the Collateral in the event of a default with respect to the Notes. As of March 31, 2021, on an as adjusted basis, after giving effect to this offering as if it had occurred on March 31, 2021, we would have had $975 million (at face value) in indebtedness outstanding (including the Notes offered hereby, the 2025 Senior Notes, $200 million Initial Financing Notes (but excluding the finance leases, Wesley Chapel Loan and other lease liabilities)), $0.1 million of issued and undrawn letters of credit outstanding and $55 million of unused revolving commitments under our Revolving Credit Facility which are secured by liens on the Collateral ranking equal in priority with the liens securing the Notes and the guarantees. The value of the Collateral may not be sufficient to pay off all amounts we may borrow under our Revolving Credit Facility, the 2025 Senior Notes, the Notes and additional indebtedness that we may incur that would be secured by liens on the Collateral on a pari passu basis as the Notes. If the proceeds of any sale of Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes (after taking into account all of our other obligations secured thereby), the holders of the Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim against our and the guarantors’ remaining assets with respect to such deficiency.",N/A,as_expected,2021,388

Under the Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor, such as the notes collateral agent, is prohibited from repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security repossessed from a debtor, without prior Bankruptcy Court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances). Moreover, U.S. bankruptcy law permits the debtor to continue to retain and to use collateral, including cash collateral, and the proceeds, products, rents or profits of the collateral, even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection”. The meaning of the term “adequate protection” may vary according to the circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the value of the secured creditor’s interest in the collateral and may include cash payments or the granting of additional or replacement security, if and at such time as the court in its discretion determines, for any diminution in the value of the collateral as a result of the stay of repossession or disposition or any use of the collateral by the debtor during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. A Bankruptcy Court may determine that a secured creditor may not require compensation for a diminution in the value of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the debt it secures. Generally, adequate protection payments, in the form of cash payments or otherwise, are not required to be paid by a debtor to a secured creditor unless the Bankruptcy Court determines that the value of the secured creditor’s interest in the collateral is declining during the pendency of the bankruptcy case, and any adequate protection payments approved by the Bankruptcy Court are limited to the aggregate amount of diminution in value of the secured creditors’ interest in the collateral occurring after the bankruptcy filing. In view of both the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection” under the Bankruptcy Code and the broad discretionary powers of a Bankruptcy Court, it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under the Notes could be made following the commencement of a bankruptcy case or the length of the delay in making any such payments; whether or when the notes collateral agent could or would repossess or dispose of the collateral; the value of the Collateral at any time during the course of the bankruptcy; or whether or to what extent or in what form holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral through the requirements of “adequate protection” or otherwise. Furthermore, in the event the Bankruptcy Court determines that the value of the Collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes (and all of our other obligations that are secured by the Collateral on a first-priority basis), the holders of the Notes would have “undersecured claims” as to the difference. U.S. federal bankruptcy laws do not permit the payment or accrual of interest, costs, expenses and attorneys’ fees during the debtor’s bankruptcy case to holders of “undersecured claims.” As a result, bankruptcy laws may act to limit the holders of the Notes’ ability to realize upon the Collateral and to limit their ability to receive postbankruptcy interest, fees or expenses or “adequate protection” with respect to any unsecured portion of the Notes. In addition, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement imposes limitations on the ability of the holders of the Notes to object to a proposed debtor-in-possession financing or the use of cash collateral or to the Liens (or court-ordered charges) securing the same (assuming certain protections and other requirements are in place in connection therewith with respect to their liens on the Collateral and certain related rights) unless the authorized agent for the lenders under our Revolving Credit Facility opposes or objects thereto. See “Description of Notes—Security—First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.” After such a filing, the value of the Collateral could materially deteriorate, and holders of the Notes would be unable to raise an objection. _Canadian Insolvency Proceedings_ We are incorporated in, and subject to, the laws of the province of Ontario and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein. Canadian Insolvency Law, which are principally contained in the CCAA and the BIA, are different from the corporate insolvency or bankruptcy laws of the United States, however can be generally understood as analogous to Chapter 11 and Chapter 7, respectively. These statutes apply across the country and allow for either a liquidation type proceeding or a restructuring type proceeding. As a result of these laws, among other things, noteholders and beneficiaries of guarantees could be stayed from enforcing upon their Notes, guarantees and corresponding security after the commencement of Insolvency Proceedings in Canada, or retaining security enforced upon prior to the commencement of such proceedings. Moreover, in such proceedings, subject to the oversight of the applicable Bankruptcy Court, the issuer or guarantor (or its trustee in bankruptcy, receiver or similar representative) may be permitted to continue to use Collateral, including cash collateral, even though the issuer and/or guarantor is in default under the applicable Notes and/or ----- guarantees. Moreover, there is no guarantee that payments will be made on account of secured debt, such as the Notes and guarantees, during the pendency of a Canadian Insolvency Proceeding, or whether and to what extent holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delays in payment, if any, of principal, interest and costs, including the fees and disbursements of the notes collateral agent. Canadian Insolvency Law does not include the concept of “adequate protection” liens or payments. In addition, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement imposes limitations on the ability of the holders of the Notes to take certain positions in a Canadian Insolvency Proceeding. See “Description of Notes—Security—First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.” Canadian Insolvency Proceedings - Liquidation Bankruptcy proceedings in Canada can be either voluntarily commenced by a debtor or commenced against the debtor by a creditor. Upon a bankruptcy occurring, all of the assets of the bankrupt (with a few limited exceptions) vest in a trustee in bankruptcy, with the proceedings being subject to the oversight of both the Superintendent of Bankruptcy and the relevant Bankruptcy Court. Typically, a trustee in bankruptcy proceeds to liquidate the assets of the bankrupt and distribute the proceeds to creditors in accordance with their legal priorities. The BIA and certain other federal and provincial statutes in Canada provide super-priority status to certain claims. These super-priority status claims are secured on certain assets of the debtor and such security may rank in priority to the security of other secured creditors, including security granted in connection with the Notes and guarantees. After the claims subject to statutory super-priorities are paid, the BIA provides that secured creditors are to be paid prior to unsecured creditors. The BIA imposes a stay of proceedings on unsecured creditors in a bankruptcy and leave is required to proceed, or continue, with any actions against the bankrupt entity; the stay generally does not apply to secured creditors, though a stay may apply to secured creditors for up to six months in certain circumstances. If no stay applies, secured creditors are free to commence or continue to enforce their security against the assets of the bankrupt, subject to satisfying the trustee in bankruptcy that they have valid and perfected security over the same. A secured creditor may also appoint a “receiver” or “receiver-manager” over the assets of a debtor, or may seek court appointment of a receiver or receiver and manager. A receivership is intended as a mechanism for realizing on collateral through a liquidation or a going-concern sale. The receivership remains subject to many of the considerations in a bankruptcy, including super-priorities, reporting obligations, etc. although certain priorities will be different where no bankruptcy is involved. Receivers appointed by the court are routinely authorized to borrow to fund the receivership proceedings, on a super-priority basis. A receiver is often appointed where only the secured creditors are likely to be paid out of the realizations or there is an opportunity to realize higher returns through a going-concern sale of the business than a piecemeal liquidation. Ultimately, however, the effect is the same: the realization on the debtor’s assets in favor of those creditors legally entitled to the proceeds. Canadian Insolvency Proceedings - Restructuring Generally, restructuring proceedings of insolvent entities are commenced under one of the CCAA or BIA, although it is also possible to restructure a solvent enterprise under the reorganization or arrangement provisions of the applicable federal or provincial corporate statute. Any such restructuring can, and almost always will, involve a stay of proceedings with respect to creditors’ rights and remedies and a compromise of the debt, including secured debt, owing by the restructuring entity. Such stays of proceedings, unlike under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, are not automatic. For large or complex restructurings, the most commonly used statute is the CCAA. The granting of an order for relief under the CCAA is in the discretion of the court, but if granted, a CCAA initial order typically involves a broad stay of proceedings (applying to secured and unsecured creditors), protection from the termination of contracts by third parties, and, in certain cases, the granting of super-priority security interests or charges (which could be in priority to the security of existing secured creditors) on the assets of the applicant debtor company to secure the payment of any amounts to be borrowed from debtor-in-possession lenders to facilitate the restructuring, any amounts owing for the fees and costs of professionals involved in the restructuring, obligations of directors of the company with respect to their statutory liabilities and sometimes other amounts. Unlike a Chapter 11 proceeding, ----- post-filing assets of a debtor company are encumbered by pre-filing security interests, and so there are no unencumbered assets (including cash collateral) against which adequate protection liens could be granted. Accordingly, secured creditors who are primed by debtor-in-possession financing or other charges are not given replacement liens to the extent of their subordination. Debtors in Canada may also proceed with a restructuring under the proposal provisions of the BIA. The proposal provisions of the BIA (the “Proposal Provisions”) provide for a process that is generally similar to, but less flexible than, restructuring proceedings under the CCAA. Upon filing a proposal (or a notice of intention to make a proposal), the BIA provides an automatic stay of proceedings, however the stay only applies to secured creditors if the proposal includes an offer to secured creditors. Such stay will remain in place until the trustee administering the proposal proceedings is discharged (e.g., the proposal is implemented and the proceedings concluded) or the debtor becomes bankrupt (e.g., via a failed proposal, as discussed below). The stay does not prevent a secured creditor from (i) dealing with the assets of the insolvent person if it took possession of the secured assets for the purpose of realization before the filing of the proposal or notice of intention to file a proposal and (ii) enforcing its security against the debtor if the secured creditor gave the required notice under the BIA more than ten days before the filing of the proposal or notice of intention to file a proposal, or if the debtor consents to the enforcement by the secured creditor in accordance with the BIA. In the case of any proceedings under the Proposal Provisions, the applicant debtor is protected from the termination of most contracts by third parties. The Proposal Provisions allow for the granting of super priority charges (similar to the CCAA), including to secure debtor-in-possession financing. Like in the CCAA, no adequate protection payments or liens are available under the Proposal Provisions, because there are no unencumbered assets created by the filing. Canadian Insolvency Proceedings – Recognition Proceedings In the event of a foreign insolvency proceeding, both the CCAA and the BIA allow a representative, authorized in a foreign proceeding in respect of a debtor, to seek recognition of the foreign insolvency proceeding in Canada (which is similar to a Chapter 15 type proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code). The CCAA and the BIA each provide for a modified version of the UNCITRAL model insolvency law.",N/A,as_expected,2021,388

The book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. We cannot assure you of the value of the Collateral or that the net proceeds received upon a sale of the Collateral would be sufficient to repay all, or would not be substantially less than, amounts due on the Notes following a foreclosure upon the Collateral (and any payments in respect of prior liens) or a liquidation of our assets or the assets of the guarantors that may grant these security interests. (after taking into account all of our other obligations that are also secured by the Collateral on a first-priority basis). In any Insolvency Proceeding with respect to us or any of the guarantors, it is possible that the bankruptcy trustee, the debtor-in-possession, any official committee of unsecured creditors appointed in such Insolvency Proceeding or any other creditor (secured or unsecured) will assert that the value of the Collateral securing the Notes and all of our other obligations secured by the Collateral is less than the aggregate amount of the principal and other amounts outstanding under the Notes and such other obligations. Upon a finding by the Bankruptcy Court that the Notes are under-collateralized, the claims in the Insolvency Proceeding with respect to the Notes would be bifurcated between secured claims up to the value of the collateral securing the Notes and an unsecured claim for any deficiency. The consequences of a finding of under-collateralization would include, among other things, (i) a lack of entitlement on the part of the holders of the Notes to receive post-petition interest, fees, costs and expenses otherwise payable under the Notes, and (ii) a lack of entitlement to receive “adequate protection” under U.S. Insolvency Laws with respect to the unsecured portion of the Notes. In addition, if any payments of post-petition interest, fees, costs and expenses had been made on account of the Notes at or before the time of such a finding of under-collateralization, those payments could be recharacterized by the Bankruptcy Court as a reduction of the principal amount of the Notes. For ----- these purposes, the value of any collateral that the collateral trustee does not have a perfected security interest in will be zero. In the event of a liquidation, foreclosure or other enforcement, the value of the Collateral securing the Notes is subject to fluctuations based on factors that include general economic conditions, the actual fair market value of the Collateral at such time, the timing and the manner of the sale and the availability of buyers and similar factors. The value of the assets pledged as Collateral for the Notes also could be impaired in the future as a result of our failure to implement our business strategy, competition or other future trends. In addition, courts could limit recoverability with respect to the Collateral if they apply certain laws to a proceeding and deem a portion of the interest claim usurious in violation of applicable public policy. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in its liquidation. A portion of the Collateral may include assets that may only be usable, and thus retain value, as part of our existing operating business. Accordingly, any such sale of the Collateral separate from the sale of certain of our operating businesses may not be feasible or of significant value. To the extent that liens, rights and easements granted to third parties encumber assets located on property owned by us or the subsidiary guarantors or constitute senior, pari passu or subordinate liens on the Collateral, those third parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property subject to such encumbrances (including rights to require marshalling of assets) that could adversely affect the value of the Collateral located at a particular site and the ability of the trustee to realize, foreclose on or otherwise enforce against the Collateral at that site.",N/A,as_expected,2021,388

Accordingly, any future pledge of collateral or future issuance of a guarantee in favor of the notes collateral agent or the holders of the Notes, including pursuant to security documents or guarantees delivered in connection therewith after the date of the indenture, might be avoidable by the pledgor or guarantor (as debtor-in-possession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy (or potentially by certain of our other creditors) as a preference or otherwise if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if (i) the pledgor or guarantor is insolvent at the time of the pledge or the issuance of the guarantee, (ii) the pledge or the issuance of the guarantee permits the holders of the Notes to receive a greater recovery than they would receive if the pledge or guarantee had not been given and the pledgor or guarantor were liquidated under a hypothetical case under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code or, in Canada, the pledge or the issuance of the guarantee has the effect of giving the recipient creditor a preference, and (iii) an Insolvency Proceeding in respect of the pledgor or guarantor is commenced within 90 days following the pledge or the perfection thereof or the issuance of the guarantee (as applicable), or, in certain circumstances, a longer period. Accordingly, if an Insolvency Proceeding was commenced in respect of us or any guarantor after the issue date of the Notes and (1) any liens not granted on the issue date of the Notes were perfected, or (2) any guarantees not issued on the issue date of the Notes (as applicable) were issued, within 90 days (or potentially one year for any “insiders” or a recipient not “dealing at arm’s length”) before the commencement of such Insolvency Proceeding, such liens or guarantees would be more likely to be avoided as a preference by the Bankruptcy Court than if delivered and promptly recorded on the issue date of the Notes (even if the liens perfected or other guarantees issued on the issue date of the Notes would no longer be subject to such risk). To the extent that the grant of any such mortgage or other security interest and/or guarantee is avoided as a preference or otherwise, holders of the Notes would lose the benefit of the mortgage or security interest and/or guarantee (as applicable). Under certain applicable law in Canada, such pledges or issuances could be voided by a Canadian court even if the pledgor or issuer was not insolvent at the time of the pledge or issuance, and no Insolvency Proceeding was subsequently commenced, if the pledgor or issuer intended to defeat, delay or prejudice one or more of its creditors by making the pledge or issuance.",N/A,as_expected,2021,388

661,Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.3,Risks Related to the Notes,13.3.30,"The Notes or a subsidiary guarantee (or the related security interests) could be voided if it constitutes a fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance under Insolvency Law, or similar state or provincial law, which would prevent the holders of the Notes from relying on us or that subsidiary (or the related security interests) to satisfy claims.","_Preferences and Fraudulent Transfers in the United States_ Under U.S. bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance laws, the Notes or a guarantee (or the related security interests) can be voided, or claims under the Notes or the guarantee may be subordinated to all other debts of the issuer or that guarantor if, among other things, the issuer or the guarantor, at the time it incurred the indebtedness evidenced by the Notes or its guarantee or, in some states, when payments become due under the Notes or the guarantee, received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the incurrence of the Notes or the guarantee (and the related security interests) and: - was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence; - was engaged (or about to engage) in a business or transaction for which the issuer’s or the guarantor’s remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital; or ----- - intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay those debts as they mature. The Notes or a guarantee (or the related security interests) may also be voided, without regard to these factors, if a court finds that the issuer issued the Notes or the guarantor entered into the guarantee (and provided the related security interests) with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud its creditors. As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent indebtedness is satisfied. A court would likely find that the issuer or a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the Notes or such guarantee and/or lien if the issuer or such guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the Notes or the applicable guarantee and/or lien. Thus, if the guarantees were legally challenged, any guarantee could be subject to the claim that, since the guarantee was incurred for the issuer’s benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit of the guarantor, the obligations of the applicable guarantor were incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration. Therefore, a court could void the obligations under the Guarantees and the related liens, subordinate them to the applicable guarantor’s other indebtedness or take other action detrimental to the holders of the Notes. If a court were to void a guarantee, you would no longer have a claim against the guarantor. Sufficient funds to repay the Notes may not be available from other sources, including the remaining guarantors, if any. In addition, the court might direct you to repay any amounts that you already received from the subsidiary guarantor. The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance laws vary depending upon the governing law, such that we cannot be certain as to: the standards a court would use to determine whether or not the issuer or the guarantors were solvent at the relevant time, or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, that it would not determine that the issuer or a guarantor was indeed insolvent on that date; that any payments to the holders of the Notes (including under the guarantees) did not constitute preferences, fraudulent conveyances or fraudulent transfers on other grounds; or that the issuance of the Notes and the guarantees would not be subordinated to the Issuer’s or any guarantor’s other indebtedness. Generally, the issuer or a guarantor would be considered insolvent if: - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, were greater than the fair value of all its assets; - the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its debts as they become due. Each subsidiary guarantee contains a provision intended to limit the guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its subsidiary guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance. However, this provision may not be effective as a legal matter or otherwise to protect the subsidiary guarantees from being voided under fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance law, or may reduce that guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its guarantee worthless. In addition, any payment by the issuer pursuant to the Notes or by a guarantor under a guarantee made at a time the issuer or such guarantor was found to be insolvent could be voided and required to be returned to the issuer or such guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the issuer’s or such guarantor’s creditors if such payment is made to an insider within a one-year period prior to a bankruptcy filing or within 90 days for any non-insider party and such payment would give such insider or non-insider party (as the case may be) more than such creditor would have received in a distribution under the Bankruptcy Code in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case. Finally, as a court of equity, the bankruptcy court may otherwise subordinate the claims in respect of the Notes or the guarantees to other claims against the issuer or the guarantors under the principle of “equitable subordination”, if the court determines that: (i) the holders of the Notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct; (ii) such inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holders of the Notes; and (iii) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. ----- _Preferences, Transfers-at-Undervalue and Fraudulent Conveyances in Canada_ In the context of Canadian Insolvency Proceedings, a trustee in bankruptcy, monitor or proposal trustee may be required to review asset transfers and transactions undertaken by the bankrupt or insolvent debtor within specified time periods prior to the commencement of the Insolvency Proceedings to determine if the debtor was engaged in any preferential transactions or transfers at undervalue. In the case of transfers at undervalue, the review period is one year (or five years for parties not dealing at arm’s length) and preferences are subject to review if they occurred within three months (or twelve months for parties not dealing at arm’s length). Provincial laws regarding fraudulent preferences, transfers at undervalue and fraudulent conveyances may also apply, and may have longer applicable review periods. A note issued, secured granted, or guarantee given (each an “Issuance”) to an arm’s length party could be voided as a preference if the issuer made the Issuance with the intent of defeating, delaying or defrauding creditors or with a view to giving the creditor a preference (if the Issuance has the effect of bestowing a preference, intent is presumed) and could be voided as a transfer at undervalue if (1) the issuer was insolvent at the time the Issuance was made, or rendered insolvent by reason of the Issuance and (2) the issuer did not receive any consideration for the Issuance, or if the consideration received for the Issuance was conspicuously less than the fair market value of the Issuance. In the case of parties not dealing at arm’s length, neither the insolvency nor the intention of the party making the Issuance is relevant to the determination of whether or not the Issuance was a preference or a transfer at undervalue in the first twelve months prior to such Issuance. Provincial legislation applicable in Canada also provides for an Issuance to be voided if it is preferential or determined to be a fraudulent conveyance. The standard of proof and look-back periods vary, but generally the transfer must be made with the intention to defeat, delay or prejudice creditors, and in many cases do not require the issuer to be insolvent or rendered insolvent by the Issuance in order for the Issuance to be voided. If a court were to find that the Issuance was a preference, transfer at undervalue or fraudulent conveyance, the court could void the payment obligations under the note or guarantee or subordinate the corresponding security to presently existing and future indebtedness of the applicable guarantor, or require the holders of the Notes or guarantees to repay any amounts received. In the event of a finding that a preference, transfer at undervalue or fraudulent conveyance occurred, the holders of the Notes may not receive any repayment on the Notes. We cannot be certain that the issuance of the guarantees or any security would not be subordinated to any of the issuer or guarantors’ other debt or determined by a court to be void.",N/A,as_expected,2021,388

The aggregate purchase price (the “Purchase Price”) payable to the Seller at the Closing is $820 million, which will include the issuance to the Seller of 14,223,570 of our common shares representing 19.99% of our issued and outstanding common shares at June 25, 2021, at a price of $2.98 per share (the “Issue Price”). The Purchase Price will be satisfied by way of a combination of cash on hand, the issuance of the Share Consideration as well as certain financing arrangements, including a debt and equity financing commitment with Stonepeak, as described below under “—Summary of the Financings” and the proceeds of the Notes offered hereby. The transaction is an arm’s length transaction and is subject to the receipt of certain regulatory approvals, including the expiry or termination of the waiting period (the “HSR Clearance”) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act (the “HSR Act”), together with the satisfaction or waiver of other customary closing conditions, including the absence of a “Material Adverse Effect” (as defined in the Share Purchase Agreement) in respect of Alliance and its subsidiaries. Akumin has obtained representations and warranties insurance on customary terms in connection with the transaction. The Share Purchase Agreement provides for the payment by Akumin of a reverse break fee to the Seller equal to: (a) 5.0% of the Purchase Price in connection with the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement under certain circumstances, including a material breach by Akumin Corp. of any covenant, representation or warranty contained in the Share Purchase Agreement; and (b) 2.5% of the Purchase Price in connection with the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement because of a failure to obtain the HSR Clearance by an agreed upon date. The Share Purchase Agreement also provides the Seller with the right to nominate a single representative (the “Seller’s Nominee”) to the Board for so long as Seller owns at least 50% of the Share Consideration, subject to certain conditions, including applicable securities law and stock exchange rules. The Seller will also receive certain customary registration rights in connection with the transaction. Subject to the satisfaction of all closing conditions, the Closing is expected to occur in the third quarter of 2021, with an outside date of October 23, 2021, being 120 days from the date of the execution of the Share Purchase Agreement (which outside date may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties for an additional 90 days).",N/A,as_expected,2021,388
661,Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.5,Summary of the Financings,13.5.1,,"In connection with the Acquisition, we and Stonepeak have executed commitment documentation (the “Note Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which, at the Closing: (a) Stonepeak will purchase Financing Notes in a minimum of $200,000,000 and a maximum of $689,570,000 aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes of Akumin Corp. It is expected that, on the date of the Closing, Akumin Corp. will issue $200,000,000 aggregate amount of Financing Notes (the “Initial Financing Notes”). The Financing Notes will bear interest at 11.00% per annum, payable quarterly in cash; provided, however, that, subject to certain conditions, Akumin Corp. will have the option for a two-year period following the Closing to satisfy the payment of interest on any Financing Notes through a combination of cash and/or via PIK. The Financing Notes will contain certain covenants similar to the covenants in the Notes; provided, however, that the Financing Notes will contain restrictions on our ability to, among other things, incur indebtedness in excess of a total leverage ratio of 4.5:1.0. See “Description of Certain Other Indebtedness—The Financing Notes”; (b) We will issue to Stonepeak 3,500,000 common shares of Akumin Inc. at the Issue Price for approximately $10,430,000. Such common shares represent approximately 4.9% of the issued and outstanding common shares of Akumin Inc. as of June 25, 2021; and (c) We will issue to Stonepeak such number of Financing Warrants equal to 15% of the principal amount of the Initial Financing Notes, divided by the Issue Price, such Financing Warrants having an exercise price equal to the Issue Price and an expiry term of ten years from the date of issuance. ----- The proceeds of this offering will reduce dollar-for-dollar the amount of the Stonepeak Note Commitment to be issued by Akumin Corp. at the time of the Closing to a minimum of $200,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Financing Notes. If this offering results in net proceeds consisting of an amount which is less than approximately $489,570,000, then Akumin Corp. will issue to Stonepeak at Closing such aggregate principal amount of Financing Notes as is required to complete the acquisition, up to $689,570,000. To the extent the aggregate principal amount of the Initial Financing Notes is less than the maximum $689,570,000 principal amount of Financing Notes available for issuance at the Closing, such unused portion will remain available to be issued by Akumin Corp. (the “Stonepeak Notes Commitment”), subject to the limitations in the covenants pertaining to the Notes, the 2025 Senior Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility, for a three-year period following the Closing, provided certain conditions are met. Any such future issuance of Financing Notes will be on the same terms described above; provided, however, that the number of Financing Warrants that accompany such issuance of Financing Notes will equal 20% of the dollar amount issued by Akumin Corp. divided by 120% of the 10day volume weighted average price of the Akumin Common Shares ending on the trading day immediately prior to the earlier of the announcement or issuance of such Financing Warrants (the “Growth Equity Warrant Strike Price”), and the exercise price for such additional Financing Warrants will be equal to the Growth Equity Warrant Strike Price, subject to regulatory approval. The proceeds of any future issuance of Finance Notes will be used to finance our organic growth as well as future merger and acquisition opportunities (unrelated to the Acquisition) that are agreed to between Stonepeak and us. At any time after seven years from the issuance date of any Financing Notes, Akumin Corp. may redeem any such Financing Notes, in whole or in part, by paying in cash the principal amount and any accrued but unpaid interest, in each case, plus 5%. To the extent that Akumin Corp. has not redeemed Financing Notes by the eleventh anniversary of the issuance date of such Financing Notes, Akumin Corp. will be required to redeem: (a) 50% of such Financing Notes (including any PIK amount) outstanding on the eleventh anniversary of such issuance date by paying in cash the principal amount and any accrued but unpaid interest, in each case, plus 5%; and (b) the remaining balance (including any PIK amount) by the twelfth anniversary of such issuance date by paying in cash the principal amount and any accrued but unpaid interest, in each case, plus 5%. A fee equal to approximately $14 million will be paid to Stonepeak in connection with the issuance of Initial Financing Notes in the form of original issue discount on such notes. The Note Purchase Agreement also provides Stonepeak with the right to nominate a single representative (the “Stonepeak Nominee”) to the Board for so long as Stonepeak owns at least $100,000,000 of Financing Notes, subject to certain conditions, including applicable securities law and stock exchange rules.

Basis of presentation,518.29.1,,"The pro forma combined financial statements are based on the respective historical consolidated financial statements of Akumin and Alliance, and has been prepared to reflect the Acquisition and the financing structure established to fund the Acquisition. The unaudited pro forma combined statement of financial position has been prepared to give effect to the Acquisition and related financing arrangements as if it was completed on March 31, 2021. The unaudited pro forma combined statements of comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 and for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020 assume that the Acquisition and related financing arrangements were completed on January 1, 2020. Pro forma adjustments reflected in the pro forma financial statements are based on available information and certain assumptions that Akumin believes are reasonable and supportable, and do not reflect the cost of any integration activities or benefits from the Acquisition, including potential synergies that may be derived in future periods. The pro forma financial statements are presented for illustrative purposes only and do not necessarily reflect the actual results of operations of Akumin had the Acquisition occurred at the dates indicated or project the results of operations of Akumin for any future date or period. The pro forma combined financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the assumptions and adjustments described below and in subsequent notes. The pro forma financial statements were prepared using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805 Business Combinations, with Akumin being the legal and accounting acquirer of Alliance. Under the acquisition method, the fair value of the purchase consideration, as well as the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on valuation which involves judgment. Accordingly, the transaction accounting pro forma adjustments have been recorded based on preliminary estimates of fair value, which have been made solely for the purpose of preparing these pro forma financial statements. Actual fair value may vary from these preliminary estimates and the differences could have a material impact on the accompanying pro forma financial statements and Akumin’s future results of operations and financial position. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the final allocation of the purchase price will not differ from the preliminary allocation reflected in the pro forma financial statements. Additionally, since the Acquisition has not yet closed as of the date the pro forma financial statements were prepared, it was necessary for Akumin’s management to make assumptions and estimates with respect to certain elements of the source of financing. Actual composition and terms of the financing arrangements may differ from management’s assumptions and estimates, which may also have a material impact on the accompanying pro forma financial statements and Akumin’s future results of operations and financial position. The pro forma adjustments are based upon the best available information and certain assumptions that Akumin believes to be reasonable. The accounting policies used to compute the pro forma adjustments include all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the Acquisition in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (""U.S. GAAP"") and incorporate the significant accounting policies expected to be used to prepare Akumin’s future consolidated financial statements. There are no material transactions undertaken between Akumin and Alliance during the periods presented in the pro forma financial statements that would need to be eliminated. Certain reclassifications have been made to Akumin’s and Alliance’s respective historical financial statements in preparation of the pro forma financial statements to conform to the financial statement presentation expected to be adopted post-closing of the Acquisition as described in the notes below. Unless indicated otherwise in the notes to the pro forma financial statements, Akumin applied applicable enacted statutory tax rates in 2021, and has used a tax rate of 26.5 percent to calculate the tax impact of the pro forma ----- adjustments. These rates may be subject to change and may not be reflective of Akumin´s effective tax rate for future periods after consummation of the Acquisition.",N/A,as_expected,2021,388

Our revenue is comprised of service fee revenue and other revenue. The following is a brief description of_ the components of our revenue: - Service fee revenue is recorded during the period in which our performance obligations are satisfied, based on the estimated collectible amounts from the patients and third-party payors. Our performance obligations are satisfied when services are rendered to the patient. Since the gap between payment and delivery of services to patients is generally expected to be less than one year, we do not adjust the service fee revenue for a significant financing component, as a practical expedient. Third-party payors include federal and state agencies (under the Medicare and Medicaid programs), managed care health plans, commercial insurance companies, attorneys, and employers. Estimates of contractual allowances and the transaction price are based on the terms specified in the related contractual agreements, negotiated rates and historical and expected payment patterns. We estimate its expected reimbursement for patients based on the applicable contract terms and negotiated rates. We believe its review process enables us to identify instances on a timely basis where such estimates need to be revised. - Other revenue consists of miscellaneous fees under contractual arrangements, including service fee revenue under capitation arrangements with third-party payors, management fees, government grants and fees for other services provided to third parties. Revenue is recorded during the period in which our performance obligations under the contract are satisfied by us. _Other GAAP measures.

The pandemic is dynamic, with various cities, counties, states and countries around the world responding or having responded in different ways to address and contain the outbreak, including the declaration of a global pandemic by the World Health Organization, a National State of Emergency in the United States and state and local executive orders and ordinances forcing the closure of non-essential businesses and persons not employed in or using essential services to “stay at home” or “shelter in place”. At this stage, we have no certainty as to how long the pandemic, or a more limited epidemic, will last, what regions will be most affected, to what extent containment measures will be applied, or the nature and timing of possible vaccinations. Imaging centers are healthcare facilities, and are generally considered an essential service with the expectation that they continue to operate during the pandemic. However, actions taken by government, referring physicians or individuals, in response to containment or avoidance of COVID-19 may impact a patient’s ability or decision to seek imaging services at a given time. Such actions may have a significant impact on volume at our imaging centers leading to temporary or prolonged staff layoffs, reduced hours, closures and other cost containment efforts. Further, there is the potential that certain non-urgent services that may be deferred without significant harm to a patient’s health may be delayed, either by us in response to local laws or public health guidance or voluntarily by the patient. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic may impact supply chains, including our supply of personal protective equipment, and lead to personnel shortages, each of which could impact our ability to safely perform imaging services. It is also possible that social distancing efforts and sanitization and decontamination procedures could cause delays in the performance of imaging services. Depending on the severity and duration of the COVID19 pandemic, we may incur incremental credit losses beyond what is currently expected, reduced revenue and income and asset impairments. We instituted several realignment and cost containment measures to respond to the drop in volume that resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic and related government orders. In March 2020, we announced the realignment of our operational resources to dedicate certain imaging centers to focus on patients showing active symptoms of COVID19 in an effort to better allocate resources and respond to public health needs associated with the COVID19 pandemic. Our cost containment measures included the temporary closure of 17 of our imaging centers to consolidate volume to nearby centers and reduced operating hours at the remainder of our imaging centers, with highest number of centers closed in mid-April, 2020. At that same time, we furloughed or laid off nearly 29% of our workforce, reduced work hours for our hourly personnel and reduced salaries by up to 20%, as well as negotiated deferral of certain costs due to landlords and other vendors. 94 ----- In light of the improving business environment for us, reflected by increases in RVUs volume in the third and fourth quarters of 2020, without contribution from new acquisitions (please refer “Selected Financial Information” below), we gradually increased our workforce throughout the first quarter 2021 (though total personnel remained below preCOVID-19 levels through to the end of the first quarter 2021). Effective January 1, 2021, all reduced salaries had been returned to normal levels. Clinical operations have resumed to normal operating hours as patient volumes allow and substantially all of the clinics that had temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic have resumed normal operations. If the future economic or legislative environment related to the COVID-19 pandemic again leads to weakened business volume, we might re-institute cost containment measures similar to those described above in order to preserve our liquidity. We did not alter our capital expenditure plans in 2020 or in the three months ended March 31, 2021 as a result of the pandemic in any material manner. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have increased the frequency of disinfecting our clinical areas, with a focus on “high touch” areas, procured increased inventories of personal protective equipment (such as masks, gowns, and gloves) and took precautions to follow guidance from the Centers for Disease Control (or CDC) and relevant state health departments in our clinics and corporate offices. To date, we have generally been able to procure enough personal protective equipment to meet our requirements. As noted below, in November 2020, we issued the 2025 Senior Notes to refinance our variable interest rate longterm debt. This reduced interest rate risk for us which could have otherwise negatively affected us during the pandemic. As of December 31, 2020, our cost of capital has not been negatively affected due to COVID-19. Finally, as further described below, we received grant funds in April 2020, December 2020 and April 2021 from Health and Human Services and advanced payments in April 2020 from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, both of which were made available under U.S. federal government stimulus made available pursuant to the CARES Act.",N/A,as_expected,2021,388

In the fourth quarter of 2020, due to slow down in collections of receivables, we changed our estimates of the implicit price concessions related to its customers, primarily based on historical experience of collections impacted by the pandemic and the integration of diagnostic imaging centers acquired in 2018 and 2019. The result of this change in estimate resulted in an increase as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 to the cumulative implicit price concessions for outstanding receivables by approximately $12.3 million ($9.4 million net of tax) in the year ended 2020. Revenue was $251,283 and $247,436 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The variance is mainly due to the 2019 Acquisitions and 2020 Acquisitions and HHS grants received under the CARES Act of $5,126, partly offset by lower same-center volume (approximately 11% as compared to approximately 8% increase in overall volume due to 2019 Acquisitions and 2020 Acquisitions) and lower service fee revenue per RVU (approximately 7%; it includes the impact of the above noted $12.3 million in implicit price concessions). The lower volume is due to the current economic environment, which lessened demand for imaging services as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related government “stay-at-home” orders and other restrictions, as well as patients deferring elective procedures, which would have required our imaging services, due to the pandemic. The lower service fee revenue per RVU resulted from increased implicit price concessions and payor and service mix. In response to decreased demand during 2020, management implemented temporary site closures of 17 locations and reduced operating hours for certain sites. In light of the improving business environment for us, we have since reopened most of our temporarily closed imaging centers and increased our operating hours. Going forward, we expect organic growth to improve, however, the COVID-19 pandemic may result in the fluctuation of organic growth rates over time.

Cash was $122,725 as at March 31, 2021, an increase of $78,329, as compared to $44,396 as at December 31, 2020. The increase in cash during the three-month period ended March 31, 2021 was due to $10,249 from operating activities and $76,341 from financing activities, partly offset by $8,261 used in investing activities. Accounts receivable were $95,886 as at March 31, 2021, an increase of $4,759, as compared to $91,127 as at December 31, 2020. We do not consider the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic material to our cash collections. However, from March 2020 through March 2021, our cash collections were impacted by COVID-19 in the following ways: - Paper-filing payors (which represent a small proportion of our payors as opposed to electronic filing payors) were temporarily delayed due to work-from-home staff’s inability to process paperwork; - Our internal and external billing resources were temporarily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in lower than usual available personnel; 100 ----- - Payments from attorney payors were lower due to delays in court hearings caused by courthouse closures or deferrals of court cases, and by “stay-at-home” and similar orders; - We believe, certain smaller payors may be delaying payments in order to manage their own cash flows during the pandemic. We have a diverse mix of payors, including private, managed care, capitated and government payors. Credit risk arises from the potential a counterparty will fail to perform its obligations. We are exposed to credit risk from our payors but the concentration of the risk is minimized because of the large customer base and its dispersion across different payors. Collectability of the receivables is actively monitored on an ongoing basis and an allowance or a write-off of allowance for bad debts is established by management. At each reporting period, we determine whether an allowance or write-off is required by estimating the expected credit losses based on a combination of probabilityweighted historic and actual bad debts experience with consideration of forward-looking information including changes to economic conditions that would impact its customers (such as unemployment rate and general economic environment for non-individual payors). During the period affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, management’s consideration of those changes to economic conditions included the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Our capital structure consists of our capital stock, contributed surplus and debt. Our primary uses of capital are to finance operations, increase non-cash working capital and capital expenditures. Our objectives when managing capital are to ensure we will continue to have sufficient liquidity so we can provide our services to our customers and returns to our shareholders. As we have primarily grown through acquisitions, we have raised debt and equity to partly finance such transactions. The details regarding any such issuances during the three-month period ended March 31, 2021 are noted in our condensed interim consolidated Financial Statements for the three-month period ended March 31, 2021. As at March 31, 2021, we had cash of $122,725. As at March 31, 2021, our working capital (currents assets excluding cash, less accounts payable and accrued liabilities) was $55,430 (2020; $60,836). The decrease in working capital was mainly due to the accrued interest expense on the 2025 Senior Notes during the three-month period ended March 31, 2021. This interest expense is paid every six months. During the three-month period ended March 31, 2021, we did not enter into any material deferral payment arrangements with our vendors due to COVID19. As at March 31, 2021, we had $467,890 of senior loans payable. As of March 31, 2021, $411 of these liabilities are due within one year. As at March 31, 2021, substantially all of our assets were pledged as security for senior loans. Under the 2025 Senior Notes, there are no maintenance financial covenants, rather there are incurrence-based covenants. As at March 31, 2021, we had operating lease liabilities of $130,281, consisting mainly of leases with remaining term of more than one year, primarily for office space. As of March 31, 2021, $9,417 of these liabilities are due within one year. As at March 31, 2021, we had finance lease liabilities of $15,497. As of March 31, 2021, $3,432 of these liabilities are due within one year. We believe we are in compliance with the terms of our leases in all material respects. We believe that our current sources of liquidity and capital will be sufficient to finance our continued operations, growth strategy and additional expenses we expect to incur for at least the next 12 months. Historically, we have financed our growth through acquisitions via both privately issued capital in the equity and/or debt capital markets and publicly issued equity, and we expect to continue to do so. We expect to gain additional access to the public equity and/or debt capital markets to support our growth strategy. There can be no assurance, however, that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available under our credit facility or otherwise to enable us to service our indebtedness, or to make capital expenditures in the future.

Subsequent to initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill acquired in business combinations is allocated to reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The determination of reporting units and the level at which goodwill is monitored requires judgment by management. Our reporting units generally represent individual business units below the level of our operating segment. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment as at October 1 or whenever indicators of impairment are present by comparing the carrying amount of the reporting units against its fair value. We review long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If any indication exists, we estimate the recoverable amount. We assess the recoverability of the assets based on the undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable, a writedown to fair value is recorded. Fair values are determined based on quoted market values, discounted cash flows, or external appraisals, as applicable. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. The amount of the impairment charge is calculated as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value, which generally represents the discounted future cash flows from that asset or in the case of assets we expect to sell, at fair value less costs to sell. 105 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,388

Income tax is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Current income tax expense represents the amount of income taxes payable based on tax law that is enacted at the reporting date and is adjusted for changes in estimates of tax expense recognized in prior periods. A current tax liability or asset is recognized for income taxes payable, or paid but recoverable, in respect of all periods to date. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. A deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be available to utilize such amounts. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are adjusted to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefits will be realized. When it appears more likely than not that deferred taxes will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax asset to its estimated realizable value. For net deferred tax assets, estimates of future taxable income are considered in determining whether net deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and we intend to settle our current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. We report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.

Because a majority of these expenses are fixed, increased revenues as a result of higher scan and treatment volumes per system significantly improves Alliance’s margins while lower scan and treatment volumes result in lower margins. _Selling, General and Administrative Expenses_ The principal components of selling, general and administrative expenses are sales and marketing costs, corporate overhead costs, information technology and professional services. _Net income attributable to non-controlling interest and earnings from unconsolidated investee_ Alliance records net income attributable to non-controlling interest and earnings from unconsolidated investee related to its consolidated and unconsolidated subsidiaries, respectively. These subsidiaries primarily provide shared-service and fixed-site diagnostic imaging, radiation therapy and interventional services. _Reimbursement_ Alliance derives most of its revenues directly from healthcare providers, primarily from hospitals, with which it contracts to provide services to their patients (“wholesale”). Additionally, some of Alliance’s revenues come from patients and their third-party payors, including government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid that Alliance bills directly (“retail”). Services for which Alliance submits direct billings for Medicare and Medicaid patients are paid on a fee schedule basis, and patients are responsible for deductibles and coinsurance. The following table summarizes the percentage of wholesale and retail revenues as a percentage of total revenues.",N/A,as_expected,2021,388

First and fourth quarter revenues are typically lower than those from the second and third quarters. First quarter revenue is affected primarily by fewer calendar days and inclement weather, typically resulting in fewer patients being scanned or treated during the period. Fourth quarter revenues are affected by holidays and client and patient vacation schedules, resulting in fewer scans or treatments during the period. The variability in margins is higher than the variability in revenues due to the fixed nature of Alliance’s costs. It also experiences fluctuations in revenues and margins due to acquisition activity and general economic conditions, including recession or economic slowdown. _COVID-19_ On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant volatility and uncertainty, which has resulted in a prolonged economic downturn that has disrupted and is expected to continue to disrupt Alliance’s business. As of March 31, 2021, the virus continues to spread outside of the United States and many countries are experiencing a resurgence in infection rates. In the United States, vaccines are available and the majority of Americans 18+ have received their vaccinations; the country is continuing to see a downward trend of 109 ----- cases, hospitalizations and death from COVID-19, although the potential for variants to cause resurgences remains a significant concern. During 2020, many of Alliance’s owned and customer operating sites were impacted by temporary closures or reduced operating hours. As a result, it experienced a reduction in procedure volumes and corresponding revenues. Although Alliance has continued to recover, the company cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate length or severity of this pandemic, nor the impact on its future procedure volumes and revenues. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic ultimately impacts the business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity may differ from management’s current estimates due to inherent uncertainties regarding the duration and further spread of the pandemic overall, its severity, actions taken to contain the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. In response to this market condition, Alliance took a number of actions in 2020 to mitigate the impact to future results of operations and cash flows, as well as to protect its financial position. These actions included, but were not limited to, the following: - Furloughed, reduced the hours for or eliminated the positions of a substantial number of employees; - Reduced compensation for executive and management employees; - Implemented certain other cost reductions; - Deferred spending on capital expenditures; and - Borrowed on its revolving loan facility as a precautionary measure to increase its cash position and help maintain financial flexibility. In addition, Alliance entered into amendments to its Credit Agreements (as defined below) during 2020. The amendments provided for, among other things, the amendment to certain financial covenants. On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law. The CARES Act includes, among other things, a number of benefits that are applicable to Alliance and other healthcare providers, provisions relating to the deferment of the employer portion of social security tax payments, as well as changes to federal income tax law including increases to the limit on the deduction for net interest expense and acceleration of the timing for refunds of alternative minimum tax credits. In addition, Alliance received payments in connection with certain provisions of the CARES Act including: (i) advanced Medicare payments and (ii) government grants to compensate for healthcare related [expenses or lost revenues attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. On December 27, 2020, the Consolidated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_Appropriations_Act%2C_2021) [Appropriations Act, 2021 was signed into law, which provided additional stimulus relief and renewed some CARES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_Appropriations_Act%2C_2021) Act programs that had expired.",N/A,as_expected,2021,388

Total Radiology revenue decreased by $56.5 million, or 15.5%, to $308.8 million in 2020, compared to $365.3 million in 2019, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 and the resulting decrease in scans during the period. MRI revenue decreased by $31.8 million, or 16.1%, to $165.8 million in 2020. The decrease is attributable to the following factors: - Same-store-growth (“SSG”) for MRI, which is calculated by comparing the cumulative scan, treatment or case volume at all locations in the current year’s period to the same period in the prior year, decreased by 12.9%. - Scan-based MRI revenue decreased by $27.4 million, or 16.5%, to $138.1 million in 2020 from $165.5 million in 2019. The decrease in scan-based MRI revenue was primarily due to year-over-year decreases in the total number of scan-based MRI scans, scans per system per day, and the average number of scan-based systems in service, partially offset by an increase in average revenue per scan. Total scan-based MRI scan volume decreased by 20.7% to 451,790 scans in 2020 from 569,385 scans in 2019. Scans per scan-based system per day decreased to 9.4 in 2020 from 10.3 in 2019. Revenue per scan increased by 5.2% from $290.61 in 2019 to $305.68 in 2020. The average number of scan-based systems in service decreased to 193.8 systems in 2020 from 202.9 systems for the same period in 2019. - Non-scan-based MRI revenue decreased by $4.4 million to $27.7 million in 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. PET/CT revenue decreased by $15.2 million, or 11.2%, to $120.4 million in 2020 compared to $135.5 million in 2019. The decrease is attributable to the following factors: - SSG for PET/CT revenue decreased by 2.0% for the year ended December 31, 2020. - Scan-based PET/CT revenue decreased by $15.0 million, or 11.7%, to $113.7 million in 2020 from $128.7 million during in 2019. The decrease in scan-based PET/CT revenue was primarily due to yearover-year decreases in the total number of scan-based PET/CT scans, scans per system per day, and the average number of scan-based systems in service, partially offset by an increase in average revenue per scan. Total volume of PET/CT scans decreased 17.3% to 117,056 scans in 2020 compared to 141,580 scans in 2019. Scans per system per day decreased to 5.5 in 2020 compared to 6.0 in 2019. The average revenue per PET/CT scan increased from $909.15 per scan in 2019 to $971.44 per scan in 2020. The average number of scan-based PET/CT systems in service decreased to 93.5 systems in 2020 compared to 102.9 systems in 2019. - Non-scan based PET/CT revenue decreased by $0.2 million in 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. 112 ----- Included in the Radiology revenue totals above are fixed-site imaging center revenues, which decreased by $14.8 million, or 15.4%, to $81.0 million in 2020 over the same period in 2019. Oncology revenue decreased by $1.4 million, or 1.0%, to $141.8 million in 2020 compared to $143.1 million in 2019, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 and the resulting decrease in treatment volumes, as well as the closure of certain underperforming sites during 2019. The number of Linac treatments performed decreased by 5.2%, and SSG for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by 4.4%. SSG for SRS decreased by 4.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The number of SRS patients treated in 2020 decreased by 4.1% when compared to the same period in 2019. Interventional revenue decreased by $14.4 million, or 24.2%, to $45.1 million in 2020 compared to $59.5 million in 2019, primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19 and temporary state-mandated closures of ASCs in both Arizona and Florida in March 2020. Alliance’s ASCs in both Arizona and Florida started to reopen in April 2020. At December 31, 2020, Alliance had 279 MRI systems and 112 PET/CT systems compared to 299 MRI systems and 118 PET/CT systems at December 31, 2019. Alliance operated 68 fixed-site radiology centers at December 31, 2020, compared to 70 fixed-site radiology centers at December 31, 2019. It operated 35 radiation therapy centers and SRS facilities (including one unconsolidated investee) at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Cost of revenues, excluding depreciation and amortization, decreased by $48.7 million, or 13.7%, to $307.0 million in 2020 compared to $355.7 million in 2019. The decrease in cost of revenues consisted primarily of a $24.7 million decrease in compensation and related employee expenses, a $7.5 million decrease in maintenance and related costs, a $7.5 million decrease in medical supplies expense, a $2.7 million decrease in transportation and fuel expenses, a $1.9 million decrease in rent expenses, a $1.6 million decrease in marketing and business development expenses, a $1.5 million decrease in travel and entertainment expenses, and a $1.4 million decrease in outsourced services, as a result of lower treatment volumes due to COVID-19 and restructuring initiatives and other cost reductions implemented in 2020. Cost of revenues, excluding depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of revenue, decreased to 61.9% in 2020 compared to 62.5% in 2019. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $12.8 million, or 13.8%, to $80.5 million in 2020 compared to $93.3 million in 2019. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses consisted primarily of a decrease in compensation and related employee expenses of $12.3 million, a decrease of $1.9 million in travel and entertainment expenses, and a decrease of $1.7 million in professional and legal expenses, partially offset by a $3.1 million increase in bad debt expense. The overall decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to restructuring initiatives and other cost reductions implemented in 2020. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue was 16.2% in 2020 compared to 16.4% in 2019. Transaction costs decreased by $11.6 million to $1.4 million in 2020 compared to $12.9 million in 2019. Transaction costs represent due diligence and other expenses incurred in connection with business acquisitions and partnership investments pursuant to strategic planning by management. The decrease in transaction costs was related to an $11.0 million termination fee paid in connection with terminating a proposed transaction to acquire e+ Cancer Care in February 2019. Restructuring charges decreased by $5.1 million to $1.1 million in 2020 compared to $6.2 million in 2019. Restructuring charges relate primarily to certain leased facilities in the Oncology Division. Impairment charges increased by $24.2 million to $29.6 million in 2020 compared to $5.4 million in 2019. Impairment charges during 2020 are composed of a $19.0 million goodwill impairment charge and a $10.0 million intangible asset impairment charge related to the Interventional reporting unit, and a $0.6 million charge related to certain long-term assets that were deemed unrecoverable. Impairment charges in 2019 are composed of a $3.9 million goodwill impairment charge related to the Interventional reporting unit and $1.5 million of charges related to certain long-term assets that were deemed unrecoverable. Severance and related costs were $1.9 million in 2020 compared to $2.9 million in 2019. 113 ----- Loss on extinguishment or modification of debt was $14.6 million in 2020 and relates to lender fees and legal, professional and other expenses incurred in connection with the amendments to Alliance’s Credit Agreements during 2020. There was no loss on extinguishment or modification of debt in 2019. Depreciation expense decreased by $4.2 million, or 7.2%, to $54.9 million in 2020 compared to $59.1 million in 2019. The decrease in depreciation expense is due to the year-over-year decrease in the number of units in the fleet along with reduced capital investments made during the last twelve months. Amortization expense was $12.2 million in 2020 compared to $12.7 million in 2019. Interest expense, net increased by $0.3 million, or 0.5%, to $56.5 million in 2020 compared to $56.2 million in 2019. The increase is primarily due to the increase in interest rates and deferred financing costs in connection with the amendments to Alliance’s Credit Agreements during 2020, partially offset by a decline in LIBOR interest rates in 2020 compared to 2019. Other income, net increased by $8.0 million to $11.2 million in 2020 compared to $3.2 million in 2019. The increase is primarily due to $6.2 million of stimulus payments received from the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) in connection with the CARES Act and $2.4 million of gain on sale of certain joint venture membership interests in the Radiology and Interventional Divisions. Income tax expense was $0.3 million in 2020 compared to income tax benefit of $6.1 million in 2019. The increase of the income tax expense in 2020 compared to 2019 was driven primarily by a valuation allowance recorded against certain deferred tax assets, partially offset by an increase in the income tax benefit associated with an increase in pre-tax loss in 2020 compared to 2019. Based on its earnings history and available objectively verifiable positive and negative evidence, Alliance determined that it was more likely than not that a portion of its deferred tax assets would not be realized in the future. Earnings from unconsolidated investee were $1.3 million in both 2020 and 2019. Net income attributable to non-controlling interest decreased by $6.5 million, or 35.0%, to $12.1 million in 2020 compared to $18.7 million in 2019. The decrease was mostly attributable to decreases in year-over-year net income derived from Alliance’s joint venture partners. Net loss attributable to Alliance HealthCare Services, Inc. was $63.4 million in 2020 compared to $43.1 million in 2019. Adjusted EBITDA in 2020 decreased by $3.3 million or 2.6%, to $125.8 million from $129.1 million in 2019 primarily due to a decrease in volumes in each of our businesses due to the impact of COVID-19 on treatment volumes, partially offset by HHS stimulus funding, restructuring initiatives and other cost reductions implemented in the first half of 2020, and performance improvement in Oncology as a result of the closure of underperforming sites.",N/A,as_expected,2021,388

Alliance believes, in addition to GAAP metrics, this non-GAAP metric is a useful measure for investors for a variety of reasons. Alliance’s management regularly communicates Adjusted EBITDA and their interpretation of such results to its board of directors. Alliance also compares actual periodic Adjusted EBITDA against internal targets as a key factor in determining cash incentive compensation for executives and other employees, largely because Alliance views Adjusted EBITDA results as indicative of how our Radiology, Oncology and Interventional businesses are performing and being managed. 117 ----- Alliance defines Adjusted EBITDA as net loss attributable to Alliance HealthCare Services before: income taxes; non-controlling interest in subsidiaries; interest expense, net; depreciation expense; amortization expense; transaction costs; restructuring charges; impairment charges; severance and related costs; loss on extinguishment or modification of debt; legal matters and other expenses; share-based compensation; and other charges (benefits), net.

In general, non-GAAP metrics have certain limitations as analytical financial measures and are used in conjunction with GAAP results to evaluate our operating performance and by considering independently the economic effects of the items that are or are not reflected in non-GAAP metrics. Alliance compensates for such limitations by providing GAAP-based disclosures concerning the excluded items in its financial disclosures. As a result of these limitations, and because non-GAAP metrics may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, the non-GAAP metrics are not an alternative to the most directly comparable GAAP measure or any other GAAP measure of operating performance.",N/A,as_expected,2021,388

The year-over-year decrease in the first quarter was primarily related to changes in its operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a decrease of $2.7 million of interest paid primarily resulting from the amendments to its Credit Agreements in October 2020. Alliance’s ability to generate cash flow is affected by numerous factors, including demand for MRI, PET/CT, other diagnostic imaging, radiation oncology, interventional services and other revenues. The year-over-year decrease during the fiscal year was primarily related to $6.6 million of stimulus payments received from HHS and $6.1 million of advanced payments for future Medicare services received from CMS in connection with the CARES ACT, decreased transaction costs in connection with the termination of a proposed transaction in 2019, change in deferred income taxes, and decreased restructuring charges related primarily to certain leased facilities in Alliance’s Oncology Division, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of COVID-19 on Alliance’s business operations. Its ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is also dependent upon the collections of its accounts receivable. Alliance’s number of days of revenue outstanding for its accounts receivable was 53 days at March 31, 2021 and 49 days as of December 31, 2020. As of March 31, 2021, it had $39.5 million of available borrowings under its revolving loan facility, net of $80.0 million outstanding on the revolving loan facility and $5.5 million outstanding in letters of credit. Management of alliance expects that it will be in compliance with the debt covenants under its credit agreements for at least the next twelve months. Alliance used cash of $8.1 million and $7.8 million for investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2021 included $6.2 million in cash used for purchases of property and equipment and $3.8 million in cash used for deposits on equipment, partially offset by $1.3 million in collections of notes receivable and $0.6 million of proceeds from sale of assets. Investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2020 included $3.8 million in cash used for purchases of property and equipment and $4.4 million in cash used for deposits on equipment, partially offset by $0.4 million of proceeds from sale of assets. Investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2020 included $27.2 million in cash used for purchases of property and equipment, an increase in deposits on equipment of $4.9 million and $7.4 million that was used for an acquisition, partially offset by $3.6 million of net proceeds from the sale of assets. Investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2019 included $26.8 million in cash used for purchases of property and equipment and $7.7 million in cash used for deposits on equipment, partially offset by $2.5 million of proceeds from the sale of assets and $0.4 million from other investing activities. Alliance may continue to use cash for acquisitions in the future. Other than acquisitions, its primary use of capital resources is to fund capital expenditures. Alliance spends capital to: - purchase new systems; 118 ----- - replace less advanced systems with new systems; - upgrade MRI, PET/CT and radiation oncology systems; and - upgrade its corporate infrastructure, primarily in information technology. Capital expenditures totaled $6.2 million and $3.8 million during the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Alliance purchased 1 radiation therapy system during the three months ended March 31, 2021. Capital expenditures totaled $27.2 million and $26.8 million in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Alliance purchased three MRI, four PETCT, one CT and five radiation therapy systems in 2020. Alliance expects to purchase additional systems in 2021 and finance substantially all of these purchases with its available cash, cash from operating activities and equipment debt. Net cash used in financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2021 was $5.5 million. Net cash provided by financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2020 was $19.4 million. Financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2021 included principal payments on its term loan facility of $7.7 million, principal payments on equipment debt and capital lease obligations of $6.6 million, and distributions to non-controlling interest in subsidiaries of $7.0 million, partially offset by proceeds from equipment debt of $15.8 million. Net cash used in financing activities were $34.2 million and $37.6 million in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 respectively. In the year ended December 31, 2020, financing activities included net proceeds of $43.0 million from Alliance’s revolving loan facility and proceeds from equipment debt of $16.4 million, partially offset by principal payments on Alliance’s term loan facility of $22.2 million, principal payments on equipment debt and capital lease obligations of $24.8 million, distributions to noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries of $26.4 million, and payments of deferred financing costs of $20.0 million. In the year ended December 31, 2019, financing activities included $22.0 million proceeds from equipment debt, $8.5 million capital contribution and $0.5 million of contributions from noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries, partially offset by principal payments on Alliance’s term loan facility of $10.1 million, net payments of $10.0 million on Alliance’s revolving loan facility, principal payments on equipment debt and capital lease obligations of $21.7 million, and distributions to noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries of $26.8 million. Financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2020 included net proceeds of $28.0 million from its revolving loan facility and proceeds of $7.9 million from equipment debt, partially offset by principal payments on equipment debt and capital lease obligations of $6.2 million, principal payments on its term loan facility of $5.1 million, and distributions to non-controlling interest in subsidiaries of $5.3 million. Alliance had cash and cash equivalents of $23.9 million, $25.8 million and $15.1 million at March 31, 2021, December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Available cash and cash equivalents are maintained in high-credit-quality third-party financial institutions. To date, Alliance has experienced no loss or lack of access to its invested cash or cash equivalents; however, it cannot assure that access to its invested cash and cash equivalents will not be affected by adverse conditions in the financial markets. At March 31, 2021, December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, Alliance had $17.5 million, $20.0 million and $15.7 million, respectively, in its accounts with third-party financial institutions that exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance limits.

AI is the sole owner of The Pain Center of Arizona (“TPC”). Prior to the AI Sale, AI owned 60% of the membership interests in Alliance Interventional-Florida, LLC (“AHIPFL”) and the joint venture partners of AI assigned their indirect membership interest in AHIP-FL to Alliance. Following that transaction, AI no longer had a membership interest in AHIP-FL. In connection with the joint venture partners’ assignment of their indirect ownership in AHIP-FL to Alliance, Alliance reclassified $2.2 million from non-controlling interest to additional paid-in capital, which primarily represents the accumulated deficit allocated to the assigned non-controlling interest. The total consideration received for the AI Sale was $15.0 million, consisting of $1.25 million in cash paid at closing and a $13.75 million promissory note due from the joint venture partners. The promissory note requires various principal payments during its term and is due on December 31, 2023. The promissory note bears interest at an annual interest rate of 9% through December 31, 2022 and 10% from January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2023. The promissory note is collateralized by a first priority security interest in all assets of AI and subsidiaries and secured by a pledge from the joint venture partners of a first priority security interest in their equity interests in AI.

To a lesser extent, Alliance generates revenues from direct billings to patients or their medical payors, and it records these revenues net of contractual discounts, estimated uncollectible amounts associated with patients, and other arrangements for providing services at less than established patient billing rates. Alliance recognizes revenue in the period in which it satisfies its performance obligations by transferring goods or services to its customers. Alliance records the amount of revenue that reflects the consideration that it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Alliance applies the following five-step model in order to determine this amount: (i) identification of the contract with a customer; (ii) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract and determination of whether they represent obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) Alliance satisfies each performance obligation. Alliance continuously monitors collections from direct patient billings and compares these collections to revenue, net of contractual adjustments and estimated implicit price concessions related to uninsured amounts, recorded at the time of service. While these contractual adjustments and implicit price concessions have historically been within Alliance’s expectations and the provisions established, an inability to accurately estimate contractual adjustments and implicit price concessions in the future could have a material adverse effect on Alliance’s operating results.

In addition, ASC 350 defines a reporting unit as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (also known as a component). A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit under ASC 350 if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and used by management. Alliance has evaluated ASC 350 and concluded there are three operating segments: Radiology, Oncology and Interventional. Alliance has assessed that each component listed above meets the definition of a reporting unit based on the conclusions that each component constitutes a business, discrete financial information is available for each component, and management regularly reviews the results of such financial information. In accordance with ASC 350, Alliance performs an annual impairment test in the fourth quarter for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would morelikely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Such indicators include a sustained significant decline in expected future cash flows due to changes in company-specific factors or the broader business climate. In evaluating goodwill for impairment, Alliance first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is morelikely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If Alliance concludes that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, Alliance conducts a quantitative goodwill impairment test. First, for each reporting unit, Alliance compares its estimated fair value with its net book value. If the estimated fair value exceeds its net book value, goodwill is deemed not to be impaired, and no further testing is necessary. If the estimated fair value does not exceed its net book value, goodwill is deemed to be impaired. Alliance records an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The quantitative impairment analysis utilizes two primary approaches to calculate the fair value of the reporting unit: the discounted cash flow method (“DCF”) and the Guideline Public Company (“GPC”) method. Under the DCF method, value is measured as the present worth of anticipated future net cash flows generated by a business. In a multi-period model, net cash flows attributable to a business are forecasted for an appropriate period and then discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. In a single-period model, net cash flow or earnings for a normalized period are capitalized to reach a determination of present value. The methods, key assumptions, degree of uncertainty associated with the key assumptions and the potential events or changes in circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the key assumptions with respect to the reporting unit are the estimated future net cash flows generated and the discount rate applied to capture the associated risks. The ability to achieve anticipated future net cash flows is subject to numerous assumptions and risks, including company-specific risks such as the ability to maintain and grow revenues, maintain or improve operating margins, control costs and anticipate working capital requirements. The anticipated future net cash flows are also dependent on industry-level factors, such as the impact of legislation, patient volumes and cost reimbursement levels, and the continued availability of qualified doctors and other medical professionals who are necessary to staff Alliance’s operations, among other potential impacts. Under the GPC method, value is estimated by comparing the subject company to similar companies with publiclytraded ownership interests. Guideline companies are selected based on comparability to the subject company, and valuation multiples are calculated and applied to subject company operating data. The key assumption used in connection with the GPC method focuses on identifying guideline companies that operate in the same (or similar) line of business as the reporting units with the same (or similar) operating characteristics. Eligible companies were selected based on Global Industry Classification Standard codes, Standard Industrial Classification codes, company descriptions, and industry affiliations. Considered factors include relative risk, profitability, and growth considerations of the reporting unit relative to the guideline companies. Value estimates for the reporting unit 122 ----- involve using multiples of market value of invested capital excluding cash to revenue and EBITDA. Valuations derived using the GPC method rely on information primarily obtained from available industry market data and publicly available filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, Alliance first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If Alliance concludes that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, Alliance conducts a quantitative impairment test, which consists of a comparison of the fair value to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis and are reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC 360, “Property, Plant, and Equipment.” Goodwill was tested for impairment at the reporting unit level as of October 1, 2020 and October 1, 2019, the dates of Alliance’s annual impairment review for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Alliance performed a quantitative test as part of its annual impairment review. In estimating fair values, Alliance used a combination of the income approach (the DCF method) and the market approach (the GPC method). In both 2020 and 2019, Alliance’s respective annual impairment tests yielded individual fair values for its Radiology and Oncology reporting units that exceeded their respective carrying values; therefore, these reporting units were not considered at risk of impairment. The estimated fair values at October 1, 2020 exceeded their carrying values by 99% and 87% for the Radiology and Oncology reporting units, respectively. In connection with 2020 and 2019 annual impairment tests, Alliance concluded that the carrying value of the Interventional reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value based on management’s assessment of the outlook and long-term business plans for this division. Consequently, Alliance recorded an impairment charge of $19.0 million and $3.9 million related to goodwill in the Interventional reporting unit in 2020 and 2019, respectively. In connection with the AI Sale, the remaining Interventional goodwill balance of $8.4 million was written off as of December 31, 2020. During December 2020, Alliance re-evaluated its finite-lived intangible assets associated with its Interventional Division due to the projected outlook and long-term business plans for the division, as well as in connection with the divestiture of a portion of this division through the AI Sale. Consequently, Alliance recorded an impairment charge of $10.0 million for the remaining carrying value of the intangible assets associated with its Interventional Division during the year ended December 31, 2020. Changes in estimates or assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and the conclusions of Alliance’s impairment tests. In addition to its annual review, Alliance performs a test of impairment when indicators of impairment are present. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no indications of impairment of Alliance’s goodwill balances. The determination of fair value of Alliance’s reporting units requires significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include earnings and required capital projections, discount rates, terminal growth rates, and operating income for each reporting unit and the weighting assigned to the results of each of the valuation methods described above. Changes in certain assumptions could have a significant impact on the goodwill impairment assessment. Alliance evaluated the significant assumptions used to determine the estimated fair values of each reporting unit, both individually and in the aggregate, and concluded they are reasonable. However, if weak market conditions continue for an extended period or the operating results of any of Alliance’s reporting units decline substantially compared to projected results, Alliance could determine that it needs to record additional impairment charges.",N/A,as_expected,2021,388

661,Offerings 2021.md,212,BUSINESS,212.6,Industry Overview,212.6.1,,"_Radiology Overview_ Radiology represents an essential capability of a hospital or health system, driving and influencing many downstream care processes across multiple medical service lines. Radiology services are utilized across virtually all disease categories in early, rapid and accurate detection, diagnosis, treatment planning and monitoring, and directly impact high focus areas such as patient safety, patient experience, length of hospital stay and downstream healthcare resource utilization. Radiology services also play a critical role in providing quality and efficient healthcare, as nearly every individual in the United States will require some form of diagnostic imaging and resulting radiology interpretation for a significant clinical indication during his or her lifetime. As a result of this widespread adoption, healthcare systems across the world and their affiliated physicians rely on efficient and effective radiology operations as well as concise and timely radiologist interpretations to make a fully informed care decisions and to keep their hospital and outpatient operations running smoothly and efficiently. In diagnostic radiology, the typical patient journey includes (i) a referral from a physician, who orders an exam to assist with diagnosing or treating a condition, (ii) the procurement of the diagnostic image, usually carried out by a technologist specialized in the particular procedure or modality, and (iii) an interpretation from a radiologist who reads and interprets the images and produces a report of their findings and recommendations, which is provided back to the referring physician for use in the next step of the patient’s care. The referring physician often consults with the radiologist to choose the appropriate modality, which could include advanced imaging techniques such as MRI, CT, and PET, or routine imaging techniques such as X-Ray, mammography, ultrasound, fluoroscopy, or nuclear medicine. Medical imaging technologies continue to evolve and play a critical role in cost-effective patient diagnosis and treatment. While X-rays are the most common imaging procedure, more sophisticated and higher reimbursement procedures, such as MRI, CT and PET scans are the fastest growing. Radiology exams can be performed at a hospital’s main radiology department or in an outpatient setting, including a hospital outpatient departments, physician offices or independent diagnostic testing facilities. Outpatient diagnostic imaging centers are primarily used to provide medical imaging services to patients who are ambulatory (meaning, they are not in the ER or inpatient) and who have been referred by a third-party physician. Standard offerings include screening and diagnostic imaging procedures such as X-ray, mammography and ultrasound along with more complex and costly services, such as MRI, CT and PET, in addition to other diagnostic and interventional radiology procedures. Outpatient diagnostic imaging is generally more cost effective compared to imaging performed in the traditional inpatient or on-campus hospital setting. We believe that this dynamic, combined with the convenience of outpatient care for patients, will result in outpatient imaging growth outpacing the overall radiology market. The gap in pricing between traditional hospital in-patient facilities and freestanding outpatient facilities has been a significant area of focus for government and third-party payors, who in an effort to curtail costs, have adopted over time a number of policies to drive price transparent, site-neutral reimbursements for advanced outpatient imaging procedures, and steerage to lower-cost, outpatient entities. Payors have also increased requirements for pre-authorization of advanced diagnostic procedures in an effort to ensure the medical necessity of those procedures. We anticipate that these trends will continue to drive procedure volume toward outpatient settings —both freestanding and hospital— outpatient. We believe these trends will drive a need for hospitals and health systems to engage service providers such as the combined company to provide services and support to build their outpatient radiology capabilities. The size of the freestanding outpatient diagnostic imaging market in the United States is estimated at more than $19 billion in annual industry revenue. The diagnostic imaging market is highly competitive, consisting of owneroperator radiologists, freestanding outpatient diagnostic imaging centers, and hospitals. We also face competition from other diagnostic imaging companies in acquiring diagnostic imaging centers. There are estimated to be more than 6,000 freestanding outpatient diagnostic imaging centers in the United States. The landscape in the outpatient 128 ----- diagnostic imaging industry is highly fragmented. Other significant radiology businesses in the United States include RadNet, US Radiology Specialists, SimonMed, RAYUS and MedQuest. We believe the outpatient diagnostic imaging industry will remain stable for the foreseeable future. Contributing to this outlook is the expectation of stable Medicare reimbursement rates. After a downward trend in reimbursement from 2007 to 2014, Medicare reimbursements have generally stabilized. From 2015 to 2020, there has been limited fluctuation in Medicare reimbursements.",N/A,as_expected,2021,388
661,Offerings 2021.md,212,BUSINESS,212.7,"Medicare Fee Schedule Trends (Top 5 MRI CPT Codes, 2000-2020)",212.7.1,,"In addition to a stable Medicare reimbursement outlook, which we believe is often used as a benchmark in the industry, we also believe the industry will see increasing imaging volumes. Since becoming a mainstream medical diagnostic mechanism in the 1990’s, utilization of diagnostic imaging has drastically increased. Over the last few decades, the imaging industry has developed significantly through improvements in technology, the development of various outpatient imaging sites of service, and the continued increase in the number of patients seeking out imaging procedures for both screening and diagnosis. Large outpatient imaging center operators, such as Akumin, are in a position to benefit from these industry dynamics. Scale, reputation and operating excellence will likely be key drivers of performance for the various industry players. There are a number of factors that we believe will drive the growth of the radiology industry, including: - _Aging demographics: The number of people over the age of 65 in the United States is expected to increase significantly, largely owing to the subset of aging baby boomers. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the “65+” population will outnumber individuals under the age of 18 by 2034. As the overall U.S. population continues to age, the need for affordable and easily accessible healthcare procedures will expand proportionally. According to the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) in 2014, senior citizens, defined as those who are 65 years old or older, made up only 13% of the total U.S. population, yet accounted for 34% of healthcare-related spending. The vast growth in the elderly population is expected to positively impact the financial landscape of the overall healthcare industry. - _Greater Consumer Awareness for Earlier Intervention and Preventative Screening: Greater consumer awareness for early intervention and increased emphasis on preventive screening have changed the perception of imaging from a luxury service to an essential part of the diagnostic process. Commercial 129 ----- payors are encouraging the appropriate use of diagnostic imaging and of preventative screenings to help decrease overall costs by reducing more expensive procedures over the long-run. - _Technological Advances Leading to More Use Cases for Radiology: We believe that further technological advancements will allow for even earlier diagnosis of diseases and disorders through less invasive methods, further driving demand for diagnostic imaging services. Additionally, the industry is seeing a shift towards the adoption of innovative technology in areas such as Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) which has the potential to transform diagnostic imaging and help with early diagnosis. _Oncology Overview_ Radiation therapy is the practice of delivering ionizing radiation to treat malignant and benign disease processes under the direction of a radiation oncologist. Radiation therapy is primarily used to treat cancer patients, as it kills cancer cells and shrink tumors via the highest possible dose of radiation, in order to destroy the cancerous cells while minimizing exposure to healthy surrounding tissue. Alliance specializes in the deployment and utilization of two primary radiation therapy modalities: Linac and targeted, robotic linear accelerators (“SRS”). Both are utilized to treat the most common and some of the most deadly cancers in the U.S., including breast, lung, prostate, colon, melanoma and brain cancer. Linac can perform different types of treatments, including conventional, intensity-modulated and stereotactic body radiation therapies via treatments that are often lower doses over more sessions and weeks. Some Linacs can provide stereotactic radiosurgery as well. SRS is specifically designed to treat tumors using stereotactic radiosurgery, which delivers higher doses and shorter course treatments given over several days. Demand for cancer care is large and growing. Radiation therapy services are essential to cancer care, with approximately 66% of cancer patients receiving radiation therapy as a part of their cancer care. As a result, the radiation therapy market is significant, with an estimated size of $3 billion and annual growth estimated in the midsingle-digits. There are more than 2,300 radiation therapy centers across the country. Radiation therapy treatment relies on the execution of technical services coordinated with professional physician and clinician services. There are a number of highly trained professionals involved in the workflow. Care is led by the radiation oncologist, a specially trained physician who works with other physicians and the full radiation therapy staff to oversee each patient’s treatment and coordinates the most appropriate radiation therapy approach for each patient. The medical physicist assures the accurate delivery of all aspects of treatment, oversees dosimetrists, and ensures that treatments are properly planned specifically for each patient. The dosimetrist designs the treatment plan (including dose distributions and calculations) for a prescribed course of therapy. This includes all specific dose calculations for each patient. The radiation therapist administers radiation therapy to patients via the specified equipment and monitors the patient during treatment. The radiation oncology nurse works with the patient and care team to provide support, care and resources before, during and after treatment. The center staff are team members who support clinical care and operations, which can include front desk staff, site administrators, navigators and others. There are a number of different Medicare payment methodologies for radiation therapy based on the site of service. Sites operating as an integrated department of the hospital are reimbursed under the Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (“HOPPS”). Freestanding outpatient radiation therapy providers are reimbursed under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (“MPFS”). Reimbursement rates are typically higher for procedures performed at a hospital outpatient department (“HOPD”), which are off-campus outpatient centers that are clinically and financially integrated with the hospital. In recent years, there has been a shift towards site-neutral payments by lowering payments to HOPDs. In the 2019 final rule, CMS set reimbursement rates for certain HOPD centers equal to 40% of HOPPS beginning in 2020, with an exception for certain HOPD centers that billed under HOPPS prior to November 2, 2015. The oncology segment of the combined company will derive revenue from both HOPPS and MPFS. Approximately two-thirds of revenue is billed to the health system or hospital partner under contractual arrangements and the 130 ----- remaining one-third of revenue is billed directly to the payor. For sites that are contracted with hospitals or health systems, the majority of centers fall under HOPPS. These centers are not subject to some of the recent developments related to despite the shift to site neutrality, since these centers have either been “grandfathered in” (have been billing under HOPPS since prior to 2015) or are located on the hospital property. For sites that bill payors directly, the vast majority of sites bill under MPFS. Radiation therapy reimbursement has generally remained stable across both Akumin’s and Alliance’s key areas of service, while site neutrality rules are expected to have minimal impact. Below are the changes in HOPPS and MPFS reimbursement rates for the last several years. In December 2015, Congress passed the Patient Access and Medicare Protection Act, which sought to develop an episodic alternative payment model for radiation therapy services. This resulted in the Radiation Oncology (“RO”) model, which aims to improve the quality of care for patients while moving towards a simplified and predictable payment system. The program is expected to go into effect on January 1, 2022 and cover periods through December 2025 for a select set of geographies and 16 disease states representing approximately 30% of eligible episodes. The model will reimburse providers based on prospective, site neutral, episode-based payments for 90-day episodes. Participants will be paid in two installments per episode (beginning and end) with reimbursement split into professional (fee for physician services) and technical components (fee for use of the facility). The program also includes the reporting of performance on quality measures, clinical data, and patient experience, which will be factored into payments. We believe that our focus on clinical quality, operational efficiency, and value-based care, as well as our integrated service line approach, position us well for the new reimbursement model.",N/A,as_expected,2021,388

Pro forma for the Acquisition, our revenue is diversified by payor source, with 52% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 generated from health systems and hospitals, 32% generated from commercial managed care, 8% from Medicare, 1% from Medicaid and 7% from other sources. We have no material revenue concentration in any health system or hospital customer or from any commercial insurance payor. We believe that this diversity in revenue sources decreases the risk to our business from the loss of any single customer or payor relationship, or changes to reimbursement rates from any single payor. Where we bill payors directly, we are also in-network with substantially all of our commercial payors and believe we are the ideal imaging partner for payors who seek to provide high quality care to patients at a low cost. By partnering with the vast majority of all major payors in our geographic footprint, we are able to provide significant savings to our payor partners by ensuring patients stay within their networks using our system of conveniently located facilities. Payor reimbursement levels are negotiated via contracts with each individual payor. These contracts allow for separate reimbursement schedules for each of the payor’s respective clients, depending on the members’ individual coverage plan. Within our radiology segment, we leverage a large network of radiologists, with some radiologists working on-site and others working remotely. Given our vast network of radiologists and dynamic IT platform, we do not rely heavily on any single radiologist to drive business. Our scale and density within selected geographies allows us to 132 ----- create close, long-term relationships with local radiology groups and referring physicians. In addition, our multimodality imaging offering provides a one-stop-shop for patients and referring physicians.",N/A,as_expected,2021,388

We are partnered with 25 of the 30 largest U.S. health systems. Our customers are health systems and hospitals seeking best-in-class partners to enable a capital efficient network and to expand their U.S. essential outpatient radiology and oncology services. We believe that healthcare trends will foster hospital- and health-system-centric models even as shifts to lower-cost outpatient care continue, and will allow the combined company to expand its platform. As hospitals consolidate and seek partners with regional or national scale and expertise in different clinical settings, the combined company’s national footprint enables it to leverage its position as a trusted partner to expand its services as an outsourced service partner. We are focused on building around the hospital’s existing network, patients and partnerships to assist our partners in delivering a full continuum of care within our communities; this legacy of hospital partnering will enable the combined company to take advantage of favorable healthcare industry trends such as increasingly higher hospital expenditures, growing elderly population, higher cancer incidences, and increased patient flows to hospitals resulting from health system integrations, industry consolidation, and increased covered lives under the Affordable Care Act. Additionally, the industry is seeing a shift towards outsourced clinical services. Currently, we estimate that approximately 90% of hospitals already outsource, or are considering outsourcing, one or more services, and we estimate that expenditures by hospitals on outsourced services are growing by at least 5% per year.

The consumer is at the heart of our strategy as increasing out of pocket costs, price transparency and access to sophisticated medical information online are changing consumer behavior in healthcare services. This is evidenced by the emergence of high deductible health plans. The percentage of U.S. workers enrolled in high deductible plans with a health savings account increased from approximately 4% in 2007 to approximately 32% in 2019.

To ensure the continued strength of relationships with referring physicians, we employ a field-based sales team whose primary responsibility is establishing new relationships and maintaining existing relationships with referring physicians. Relationships with new referring physicians are developed through our value proposition (i.e. consistent service, excellent patient care and referring provider communications, contracts with substantially all payors, convenience and access to top subspecialty radiologists and radiation oncologists). Existing relationships are maintained by ensuring we continue to deliver our value proposition in a consistent manner. We stress the importance of operational excellence which ultimately manifests itself in a better patient experience. To ensure continuous engagement with the community — including consumers, patients and their loved ones — we deploy a number of market-specific, direct-to-consumer marketing and communications strategies, focused largely on digital outreach (e.g., websites, search engine optimization, online reputation management, digital advertising and social media) and addressing consumers’ most critical questions: how to decide, what to expect, how to prepare, what they will pay and what will happen next. Our marketing strategies and tactics are coordinated through centralized resources with expertise in specific areas and on a shared platform to ensure compliance with healthcare marketing regulations. Within our radiology segment, in markets with robust demand, we will consider adding modalities in centers that are currently only single or dual modality centers. Multi-modality centers help diversify risk while contributing positively to our margins and provide referring physicians with a “one-stop shop” for their patients. To attain growth and offer a competitive differentiator in key markets, we will also consider replacing or adding new technologies and equipment. While reimbursement rates may not change with newer equipment, we believe this strategy, in particularly competitive markets, will offer us a market advantage which will ultimately lead to increased volumes. An example of this is our investment in 3D digital mammography, which is preferred by many women (who can self-refer for mammography) and is now being reimbursed by many of the large national insurance payors in addition to Medicare.

The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad, and it prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. The OIG has issued regulations as ""safe harbor"" guidelines which if met in form and substance, will assure healthcare providers that they will not be prosecuted for violation of the Anti–Kickback Statute. Although full compliance with these provisions ensures against prosecution under the federal Anti–Kickback Statute, the failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit within a specific safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the transaction or arrangement is illegal or that prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute will be pursued.

The Stark Law provides that a request by a radiologist for diagnostic radiology services or a request by a radiation oncologist for radiation therapy, if such services are furnished by or under the supervision of such radiologist or radiation oncologist pursuant to a consultation requested by another physician, does not constitute a referral by a referring physician. If such requirements are met, the Stark Law self-referral prohibition would not apply to such services.

For example, HIPAA imposes privacy, security and breach notification obligations on certain health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses, known as covered entities, as well as their business associates that perform certain services that involve creating, receiving, maintaining or transmitting individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of such covered entities. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a breach of unsecured protected health information, a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by HHS, may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance. Further, entities that knowingly obtain, use, or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA may be subject to criminal penalties. Even when HIPAA does not apply, according to the FTC, violating consumers’ privacy rights or failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure may constitute unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the FTC Act. The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities.

In addition, private parties have the right to bring “qui tam”, or “whistleblower” suits against companies under the FCA.

In or about June, 2016, PIC entered into a no-fault settlement agreement with the DOJ with respect to those allegations, which included PIC paying $3.5 million to the U.S. government and entering into a CIA with the OIG. PIC’s CIA expired June 29, 2021, and as of the date of this offering memorandum PIC is completing its reporting with respect to the final year of that CIA. We expect to receive notice that we have closed the Akumin Texas CIA in the third quarter of 2021. The compliance measures and the reporting and auditing requirements contained in the CIAs include: - continuing the duties and activities of the Compliance Officer and Compliance Committee; 142 ----- - maintaining written policies and procedures addressing matters included in our Compliance Program; - continuing general compliance training; - engaging an independent third party to perform an annual review of our compliance with the CIAs; - continuing the confidential disclosure program and hotline to enable employees or others to disclose issues or questions regarding possible inappropriate policies or behavior; - continuing the screening program to ensure that we do not hire or engage employees or contractors who are ineligible persons for federal healthcare programs; - reporting any material deficiency which resulted in an overpayment to us by a federal healthcare program; and submitting annual reports to the OIG which describe in detail the operations of the corporate Compliance Program. Material, uncorrected violations of the CIA could lead to our exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. In addition, we are subject to possible civil penalties for failure to substantially comply with the terms of the CIA, including stipulated penalties ranging between $1,000 and $2,500 per day. We are also subject to a stipulated penalty of $50,000 for each false certification made by us or on our behalf, pursuant to the reporting provisions of the CIA. The CIA increases the amount of information we must provide to the federal government regarding our practices at our healthcare facilities and our compliance with federal regulations. The reports we provide in connection with the CIA could result in greater scrutiny by other regulatory agencies.

All Escrowed Funds on deposit with the Escrow Agent will be invested by the Escrow Agent at the Issuer’s instruction in Treasury Securities and other Escrow Investments. “Treasury Securities” means any investment in obligations issued or guaranteed by the United States government or any agency thereof, in each case, maturing no later than the Outside Date. “Escrow Investments” means any of the following securities: (1) Treasury Securities; (2) investments in time deposit accounts, certificates of deposit and money market deposits, in each case maturing no later than the Outside Date, entitled to U.S. Federal deposit insurance for the full amount thereof or issued by a bank or trust company (including the Escrow Agent or an affiliate of the Escrow Agent) that is organized under the laws of the United States of America or any state thereof having capital, surplus and undivided profits aggregating in excess of $500.0 million; (3) investments in commercial paper maturing no later than the Outside Date and having, at the date of acquisition, a credit rating no lower than A-1 from S&P, P-1 from Moody’s, or F-1 from Fitch; (4) repurchase obligations maturing no later than the Outside Date entered into with a nationally recognized broker-dealer, with respect to which the purchased securities are obligations issued or guaranteed by the United States government or any agency thereof, which repurchase obligations shall be entered into pursuant to written agreements; and (5) money market mutual funds that invest in items (1) through (4) above and are registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and operated in accordance with Rule 2a-7 and that at the time of such investment are rated Aaa by Moody’s and/or AAA by S&P, including such funds for which the Trustee or an affiliate provides investment advice or other services. If the Escrow Agent receives a Special Redemption Notice, the Escrow Agent will liquidate all Escrowed Funds then held by it not later than the last Business Day prior to the Special Mandatory Redemption Date. On the Business Day prior to the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, the Escrow Agent will deliver sufficient funds to the Trustee for payment of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price to the holders of Notes. After payment of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price to the holders of the Notes, any excess Escrowed Funds will be returned to the Issuer. No provisions of the Escrow Agreement (including, without limitation, those relating to the release of the Escrowed Funds) may be waived or modified in any manner materially adverse to the holders of the Notes (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) without the written consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes outstanding. To the extent such provisions relate to the Issuer’s obligation to redeem the Notes in a Special Mandatory Redemption, no provisions of the Indenture, may be waived or modified in any manner materially adverse to the holders of the Notes without the written consent of all of such holders. If we are able to consummate the Acquisition on the same day that we close this offering, then we may elect to forego the escrow procedures described above in their entirety, in which case there would be no Escrow Agreement, escrow account or Special Mandatory Redemption provisions. To secure the Obligations with respect to the Notes, the Escrow Issuer will grant the trustee, for the benefit of the holders of the notes, a first priority security interest in the Escrow Account and all deposits therein, pending disbursement as described above, and the Escrow Agreement will require that such security interest be perfected upon or prior to the closing of this offering. Except as the context otherwise requires, the provisions described elsewhere in this “Description of Notes” refer to the provisions of the Indenture as will be in effect following the consummation of the Acquisition and the satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions (such date, the “Escrow Release Date”). 156 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,388

In addition, following the Issue Date, any Restricted Subsidiary (including our Professional Services Affiliates) of the Issuer that becomes a guarantor under certain Indebtedness must also guarantee the Notes. Not all of our Subsidiaries guarantee the Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of these non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, these non-Guarantor Subsidiaries will be obligated to pay the holders of their indebtedness and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to us. For the twelvemonth period ended March 31, 2021, after giving effect to the Transactions, our non-Guarantor Subsidiaries represented approximately 21% of our total revenue. As of March 31, 2021, after giving effect to the Transactions, our non-Guarantor Subsidiaries held approximately 7% of our total assets and approximately 3% of our total liabilities. The Guarantee provided by each Guarantor: - is a senior secured obligation of such Guarantor; - ranks equally in right of payment with all existing and future senior debt of such Guarantor (including the Credit Agreement Obligations and the 2025 Senior Notes Obligations); - ranks senior in right of payment to all future Subordinated Indebtedness of such Guarantor, if any; - is secured on a first-priority basis by Liens on the Collateral (subject to Permitted Liens and certain exceptions) on an equal and ratable basis with all existing and future obligations of such Guarantor under any other First Lien Obligations (including the Credit Agreement Obligations and the 2025 Senior Notes Obligations); - ranks effectively senior to all existing and future unsecured obligations, including the Initial Financing Notes and any other Financing Notes issued after the Closing, and obligations of such Guarantor under any Junior Lien Obligations, to the extent of the value of the Collateral; - ranks effectively junior to all existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is secured by Liens on assets that do not constitute a part of the Collateral, to the extent of the value of such assets; and 157 ----- - is structurally subordinated to all debt and other liabilities (including trade payables) of any Subsidiaries (if any) of such Guarantor that are not Guarantors.

Interest on the Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year composed of twelve 30-day months. Solely for the purposes of disclosure pursuant to the Interest Act (Canada), whenever any interest is calculated using a rate based on a year of 360 days or the number of days in accordance with market practice, as the case may be, such rate determined pursuant to such calculation, when expressed as an annual rate, is equivalent to (i) the applicable rate based on a year of 360 days or the number of days in accordance with market practice, as the case may be, multiplied by (ii) the actual number of days in the calendar year in which the period for such interest is payable (or compounded) ends, divided by (iii) 360 or the number of days in accordance with market practice, as the case may be.

The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent such Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under applicable law. This provision may not, however, be effective to protect a Guarantee from being voided under fraudulent transfer or conveyance law, or may reduce the applicable Guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its Guarantee worthless. In addition to potentially being voidable, a Guarantee could also be subordinated by a court to all other Indebtedness (including Guarantees and other contingent liabilities) of the Guarantor, and, depending on the amount of such Indebtedness, a Guarantor’s liability on its Guarantee could be reduced to zero. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—A subsidiary guarantee could be voided if it constitutes a fraudulent transfer under U.S. bankruptcy or similar state law or foreign law, which would prevent the holders of the notes from relying on that subsidiary to satisfy claims.” Each Guarantor that makes a payment or distribution under a Guarantee will be entitled upon payment in full of all guaranteed obligations under the Indenture to a contribution from each other Guarantor in an amount equal to such other Guarantor’s pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net worth of all the Guarantors at the time of such payment determined in accordance with GAAP. 158 ----- Each Guarantor may consolidate or amalgamate with or merge into or sell its assets to us or another Restricted Subsidiary, or with or to other Persons in a transaction that complies with the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales” or “—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets,” as applicable.

The Liens on the Collateral that will secure the Notes and the Guarantees will be granted under the Collateral Documents in favor of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Notes Secured Parties. By its acceptance of a Note, each holder of the Notes authorizes the Collateral Agent and the Trustee, if applicable, to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Collateral Documents, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and, if applicable, any Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement, binding the holders to the terms thereof.

The value of the Collateral in the event of liquidation will depend on many factors, including, among other things, the condition of the Collateral, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, the condition of the international, national and local economies, the availability of buyers and similar factors. By its nature, some of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value or market. Consequently, liquidating the Collateral may not produce proceeds in an amount sufficient to pay any amounts due on the Notes. We are also permitted to sell assets that constitute Collateral and may not be required to offer to purchase the Notes. In addition, the Collateral securing the Notes Obligations is shared with other creditors, subject to all other Permitted Liens and the security interests in the Collateral securing the Notes will be pari passu in priority with any and all security interests at any time granted to secure the Credit Agreement Obligations, the 2025 Senior Notes Obligations and other First Lien Obligations. If there is a default, the value of the Collateral may not be sufficient to repay the creditors of First Lien Obligations, including the holders of the Notes. In the event of a foreclosure, enforcement, Insolvency Proceeding, or similar proceeding, we cannot assure you that the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the Collateral will be sufficient to pay Notes Obligations and the other First Lien Obligations. Any claim for the difference between the amount, if any, realized by holders of the Notes from the sale of Collateral securing the Notes Obligations will rank equally in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other unsecured or undersecured senior Indebtedness and other unsubordinated Obligations, including trade payables. To the extent that third parties establish Liens on the Collateral, such third parties could have rights and remedies with respect to the assets that, if exercised, could adversely affect the value of the Collateral or the ability of the Collateral Agent or the holders of the Notes to realize or foreclose on the Collateral. The Issuer may also issue additional Notes after the Issue Date as described herein or otherwise incur First Lien Obligations that would be secured by Liens on the Collateral, the effect of which would be to increase the amount of Indebtedness secured equally and ratably by Liens on the Collateral. As described below, the ability of the holders of the Notes to realize on the Collateral would also be subject to certain Bankruptcy Law limitations in the event of an Insolvency Proceeding. See “Risk Factors— Risks Related to the Notes—Rights of holders of the notes in the Collateral may be adversely affected by bankruptcy proceedings.”",N/A,as_expected,2021,388
661,Offerings 2021.md,124,DESCRIPTION OF NOTES,124.5,Security,124.5.3,Certain Bankruptcy and Insolvency Limitations,"The right of the Collateral Agent to foreclose upon, enforce against, repossess, and dispose of the Collateral upon the occurrence of an Event of Default would be significantly impaired (and at a minimum delayed) by applicable Bankruptcy Law in the event that an Insolvency Proceeding were to be commenced by or against the Issuer or any Guarantor prior to the Collateral Agent’s having foreclosed upon, repossessed, disposed of or otherwise enforced against the Collateral. Upon the commencement of an Insolvency Proceeding, a secured creditor such as the Collateral Agent is prohibited from foreclosing upon, enforcing or repossessing its security from a debtor, or from disposing of previously repossessed security, in each case, without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under the facts in any particular circumstances). In view of the broad equitable powers of a U.S. or Canadian bankruptcy court as well as the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection”, it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under the Notes could be made following the commencement of an Insolvency Proceeding or the length of the delay in making any such payments, whether or when the Collateral Agent could repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value of the Collateral at any time during an Insolvency Proceeding or whether or to what extent holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral (through adequate protection or otherwise). Furthermore, in the event a bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes and all other obligations secured on a pari passu or senior basis with respect to all or any such Collateral, the holders of the Notes would hold secured claims only to the extent of the value of the Collateral to which the holders of the Notes are entitled, and unsecured claims with respect to such shortfall. The Applicable 161 ----- Bankruptcy Law permits the payment and/or accrual of post-petition interest, fees and expenses to a secured creditor during a debtor’s Insolvency Proceeding only to the extent the value of such creditor’s interest in the collateral is determined by the bankruptcy court to exceed the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the obligations secured by the collateral. See “Risk Factors—Risk Related to the Notes—The value of the Collateral may not be sufficient to secure postpetition interest, fees, and expenses in an Insolvency Proceeding of us or any of the guarantors. In the event of an Insolvency Proceeding of us or any of the guarantors, the holders of the notes would be deemed to have an unsecured claim to the extent that our obligations in respect of the notes and all of our other obligations secured by the Collateral equal or exceed the fair market value of the Collateral.”",N/A,as_expected,2021,388

After the Applicable Authorized Agent Change Date, the Applicable Authorized Representative will be the Authorized Representative of the Series of First Lien Obligations (other than the Credit Agreement Obligations) that constitutes the largest outstanding principal amount of any then outstanding Series of First Lien Obligations (other than the Credit Agreement Obligations) (the “Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative”). The “Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date” is the date that is 120 days (throughout which 120-day period the Applicable Authorized Representative was the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative) after the occurrence of both (a) an event of default, as defined in the indenture or other governing agreement for that Series of First Lien Obligations, and (b) the Trustee’s and each other Authorized Representative’s receipt of written notice from that Authorized Representative certifying that (i) such Authorized Representative is the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative and that an event of default, as defined in the indenture or other governing agreement for that Series of First Lien Obligations, has occurred and is continuing and (ii) the First Lien Obligations of that Series are currently due and payable in full (whether as a result of acceleration thereof or otherwise) in accordance with the indenture or other governing agreement for that Series of First Lien Obligations; provided that the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date shall be stayed and shall not occur and shall be deemed not to have occurred with respect to any Collateral (1) at any time the Credit Agreement Administrative Agent or the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent has commenced and is diligently pursuing any enforcement action with respect to such Collateral or (2) at any time the Issuer or any Guarantor that has granted a security interest in such Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any Insolvency Proceeding. With respect to any Collateral, (i) the Applicable Collateral Agent shall act only on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative, (ii) the Applicable Collateral Agent shall not follow any instructions with respect to such Collateral from any Non-Controlling Authorized Representative (or any other First Lien Secured Party other than the Applicable Authorized Representative) and (iii) no Non-Controlling Authorized Representative or other First Lien Secured Party (other than the Applicable Authorized Representative) shall or shall instruct the Applicable Collateral Agent to, commence any judicial or nonjudicial enforcement or foreclosure proceedings with 163 ----- respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, interim receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or over, attempt any action to take possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise take any action to enforce its security interest in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of, any Collateral. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) in any Insolvency Proceeding, the Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party may file a proof of claim or statement of interest with respect to the First Lien Obligations owed to such First Lien Secured Party; (ii) the Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party may take any action to preserve or protect the validity and enforceability of the Liens granted in favor of such First Lien Secured Parties, provided that no such action is, or could reasonably be expected to be, (A) adverse, in any material respect, to the Liens granted in favor of the Controlling Secured Parties or the rights of the Applicable Collateral Agent or any other Controlling Secured Parties to exercise remedies in respect thereof or (B) otherwise inconsistent with the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement; and (iii) the Collateral Agent or any First Lien Secured Party may file any responsive or defensive pleadings in opposition to any motion, claim, adversary proceeding or other pleading made by any person objecting to or otherwise seeking the disallowance of the claims or Liens of such First Lien Secured Party, including any claims secured by the Collateral, in each case, to the extent not inconsistent with the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement or any other documents relating to the security granted with respect to the Credit Agreement Obligations to the contrary, Collateral consisting of cash and Cash Equivalents pledged to secure the Credit Agreement Obligations consisting of reimbursement obligations in respect of Letters of Credit (as defined in the Credit Agreement) (solely to the extent pledged for the benefit of the relevant Letter of Credit issuer and any participants therein) shall be applied as specified in the Credit Agreement and will not constitute Shared Collateral. Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens on the Collateral, the Applicable Collateral Agent (acting on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative), may deal with the Collateral as if such Applicable Collateral Agent had a senior Lien on such Collateral. No representative of any Non-Controlling Secured Party may contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the Applicable Collateral Agent, the Applicable Authorized Representative or the Controlling Secured Party. Each of the First Lien Secured Parties also have agreed that it will not (and have agreed to waive any right to) question or contest or support any other Person in contesting, in any proceeding (including any Insolvency Proceeding), the perfection, priority, validity, attachment or enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf of any of the First Lien Secured Parties on all or any part of the Collateral or the provisions of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and the Applicable Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party is taking action to enforce rights in respect of any Collateral, or any distribution is made in respect of any Collateral in any Insolvency Proceeding of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including any adequate protection payments) or any of the holders of the Notes, the Credit Agreement Secured Parties, the 2025 Senior Notes Secured Parties and the holders of any other First Lien Obligations receives any payment pursuant to any intercreditor agreement (other than the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) with respect to any Collateral, the proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Collateral by any Authorized Representative or any holder of First Lien Obligations or received by any Authorized Representative pursuant to such intercreditor agreement with respect to any Collateral and proceeds of any such distribution (after payment of the costs of enforcement and collateral administration) (subject, in the case of any such payments, proceeds or distribution, to the sentence immediately following) to which the First Lien Obligations are entitled under any intercreditor agreement (other than the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) shall be distributed ratably to the applicable Authorized Representatives for further distribution to the holders of the Notes and the Notes Obligations, the holders of Credit Agreement Obligations, the holders of the 2025 Senior Notes Obligations and the holders of any Future First Lien Indebtedness after payment of all amounts owing to the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent, the Collateral Agent and each collateral agent with respect to Future First Lien Obligations; provided that following the commencement of any Insolvency Proceeding with respect to the Issuer or any Guarantor, solely as among the holders of First Lien Obligations and solely for purposes of the corresponding paragraph in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and not any other documents governing First Lien Obligations, in the event the value of the Collateral is not sufficient for the entire amount of post-petition interest, fees, or expenses on the First Lien Obligations to be allowed under Section 506(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other Bankruptcy Law in such Insolvency Proceeding, the amount of First Lien Obligations of each Series of First Lien Obligations shall include only the maximum amount of post-petition interest, fees, or expenses on the First Lien 164 ----- Obligations allowable under Section 506(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other Bankruptcy Law in such Insolvency Proceeding. The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement provides that it is the intention of the First Lien Secured Parties of each Series that the holders of First Lien Obligations of such Series (and not the First Lien Secured Parties of any other Series) bear the risk of (i) any determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that (x) any of the First Lien Obligations of such Series are unenforceable under applicable law or are subordinated to any other obligations (other than another Series of First Lien Obligations), (y) any of the First Lien Obligations of such Series do not have a valid and perfected security interest in any of the Collateral securing any other Series of First Lien Obligations and/or (z) any intervening security interest exists securing any other obligations (other than another Series of First Lien Obligations) on a basis ranking prior to the security interest of such Series of First Lien Obligations but junior to the security interest of any other Series of First Lien Obligations or (ii) the existence of any Collateral for any other Series of First Lien Obligations that is not Collateral for such Series of First Lien Obligations (any such condition referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii) with respect to any Series of First Lien Obligations, an “Impairment” of such Series). In the event of any Impairment with respect to any Series of First Lien Obligations, the results of such Impairment shall be borne solely by the holders of such Series of First Lien Obligations, and the rights of the holders of such Series of First Lien Obligations (including, without limitation, the right to receive distributions in respect of such Series of First Lien Obligations pursuant to the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) set forth herein shall be modified to the extent necessary so that the effects of such Impairment are borne solely by the holders of the Series of such First Lien Obligations subject to such Impairment. Additionally, in the event the First Lien Obligations of any Series are modified pursuant to applicable law (including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code or any equivalent provision of any other Bankruptcy Law), any reference to such First Lien Obligations or the First Lien Documents governing such First Lien Obligations shall refer to such obligations or such documents as so modified. If, at any time the Applicable Collateral Agent forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any Collateral resulting in a sale or disposition thereof, then (whether or not any Insolvency Proceeding is pending at the time) the Collateral Agent’s Liens on such Collateral will automatically be released and discharged as and when, but only to the extent, the Applicable Collateral Agent’s Liens on such Collateral are released and discharged. The Collateral Agent will execute and deliver all such authorizations and other instruments as shall be reasonably requested by the Applicable Collateral Agent (at the Issuer’s and the Guarantor’s sole cost and expense) to evidence and confirm any such release. Under the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, if the Collateral Agent or the holders of the Notes (or any Authorized Representative in respect of, or any holders of, any other First Lien Obligations) shall obtain possession of any Collateral or shall realize any proceeds or payment in respect of any such Collateral, pursuant to any First Lien Document or by the exercise of any rights available to it under applicable law or in any Insolvency Proceeding or through any other exercise of remedies (including pursuant to any intercreditor agreement), at any time prior to the discharge of each of the First Lien Obligations, then it shall hold such Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other First Lien Secured Parties and promptly transfer such Collateral, proceeds or payment, as the case may be, to the Applicable Collateral Agent, to be distributed in accordance with the provisions of the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

Within 30 days following any Change of Control, we will be required to send a notice to each holder electronically in accordance with the procedures of the depository or by first-class mail with a copy to the Trustee stating: (1) that the Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the covenant described under “—Change of Control”; (2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which shall be no earlier than 30 days and not later than 60 days after the date such notice is sent (the “Change of Control Payment Date”); (3) that any Notes not tendered will continue to accrue interest in accordance with the terms of the indenture; (4) that, unless we default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date; (5) that holders will be entitled to withdraw their election if the paying agent receives, not later than the close of business on the second Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date, a notice sent electronically in accordance with the procedures of the depository or by first-class mail setting forth the name of the holder, the principal amount of Notes delivered for purchase, and a statement that such holder is unconditionally withdrawing its election to have such Notes purchased; (6) that holders whose Notes are being purchased only in part will be issued new Notes equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, which unpurchased portion must be equal to $2,000 in principal amount or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof; and (7) any other information material to such holder’s decision to tender Notes. We will be required to comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes required in the event of a Change of Control and will not be deemed to have violated the “Change of Control” provisions of the indenture as a result of such compliance. We will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the indenture applicable to Change of Control Offer made by us. Our obligations in respect of a Change of Control Offer can be modified with 170 ----- the consent of holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding at any time prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer. Due to our leveraged structure and the terms of other indebtedness to which we and our Subsidiaries are or may in the future be subject, we may not be able to repurchase all of the Notes tendered upon a Change of Control. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—Upon a change of control, we may not have the funds necessary to finance the change of control offer required by the indenture governing the notes, which would violate the terms of the notes.” If we fail to repurchase all of the Notes tendered for purchase upon a Change of Control, such failure will constitute an Event of Default. In addition, the occurrence of certain of the events which would constitute a Change of Control would require an offer to purchase the 2025 Senior Notes and may require an offer to purchase the Financing Notes and would constitute an event of default under the Credit Agreement and may constitute an event of default under future Indebtedness. Moreover, the exercise by the holders of their right to require us to purchase the Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of the repurchase on us. Finally, our ability to pay cash to the holders upon a Change of Control may be limited by our then existing financial resources. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a phrase relating to the sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposition of “all or substantially all” of our assets. Although there is a developing body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, if we dispose of less than all our assets by any of the means described above, the ability of a holder of Notes to require us to repurchase its Notes may be uncertain. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the indenture does not contain any provisions that permit the holders of the Notes to require that we repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.",N/A,as_expected,2021,388

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (a) the outstanding principal amount of any item of Indebtedness shall be counted only once, and any obligation arising under any guarantee, Lien, letter of credit or similar instrument supporting such Indebtedness incurred in compliance with this covenant shall be disregarded, and (b) if an item of Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the categories described in clauses (1) through (27) above or is permitted to be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant and also meets the criteria of one or more of the categories described in clauses (1) through (27) above, we shall, in our sole discretion, classify such item of Indebtedness in any manner that complies with this covenant and may from time to time reclassify such item of Indebtedness in any manner in which such item could be incurred at the time of such reclassification; _provided that Indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Agreement on the Issue Date (and any Indebtedness secured_ by a Lien that refinances such Indebtedness) shall be deemed to be outstanding under clause (2) above and may not be reclassified. Accrual of interest or dividends on Preferred Equity Interests, the accretion of original issue discount and the payment of interest or dividends on Preferred Equity Interests in the form of additional Indebtedness or Preferred Equity Interests of the same class will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of determining compliance with this covenant. Any increase in the amount of Indebtedness solely by reason of currency fluctuations will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of determining compliance with this covenant. A change in GAAP that results in an obligation existing at the time of such change, not previously classified as Indebtedness, becoming Indebtedness will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of determining compliance with this covenant. The amount of indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (1) the accreted value thereof, in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount, (2) the principal amount thereof, in the case of any other Indebtedness, (3) in the case of the guarantee by the specified Person of any Indebtedness of any other Person, the maximum liability to which the specified Person may be subject upon the occurrence of the contingency giving rise to the obligation and (4) in the case of Indebtedness of others guaranteed by means of a Lien on any asset of the specified Person, the lesser of (A) the Fair Market Value of such asset on the date on which Indebtedness is required to be determined pursuant to the indenture and (B) the amount of the Indebtedness so secured. For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated by us based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit Indebtedness; provided that if such Indebtedness is incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-dominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar-dominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that we may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, (1) if incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated by us based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing and (2) shall be deemed to be outstanding only when the proceeds thereof are not applied to effect such refinancing (and to pay any fees, expenses, commissions and costs in connection therewith) substantially concurrently. 178 ----- Notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness incurred to refinance Indebtedness initially incurred in reliance on a clause of the second paragraph of this covenant measured by reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA at the time of incurrence, if such refinancing would cause the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA on the date of such refinancing, such percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus accrued and unpaid interest, dividends, premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting discounts, fees, costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) in connection with such refinancing. The Indenture does not treat unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured. _Limitation on Asset Sales._ The indenture provides that we will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, consummate any Asset Sale unless: (1) we or such Restricted Subsidiary receives consideration at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value (determined as of the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale) of the assets included in such Asset Sale); and (2) other than with respect to Permitted Asset Swaps, at least 75% of the total consideration in such Asset Sale consists of cash or Cash Equivalents or Marketable Securities. For purposes of clause (2), the following shall be deemed to be cash: (a) the amount (without duplication) of any Indebtedness (other than Subordinated Indebtedness) of us or such Restricted Subsidiary that is expressly assumed by the transferee in such Asset Sale and with respect to which we or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is unconditionally released by the holder of such Indebtedness, (b) the amount of any obligations or securities received from such transferee that are within 180 days converted by us or such Restricted Subsidiary to cash (to the extent of the cash actually so received), (c) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Sale, to the extent that the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Sale, and (d) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate Fair Market Value, taken together with all other Designated Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (c), not to exceed the greater of $20 million and 10% of Consolidated EBITDA for the most recently ended Measurement Period (calculated on a pro forma basis), with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value. If we or any Restricted Subsidiary engages in an Asset Sale, we or such Restricted Subsidiary shall apply all or any of the Net Proceeds therefrom to: (1) at our election, either (x) repay First Lien Obligations (and in the case of any such repayment under any revolving credit facility, effect a permanent reduction in the availability under such revolving credit facility) or (y) repay, redeem or purchase the Notes; provided that if we repay First Lien Obligations (other than the Notes) pursuant to clause (x), we will apply a pro rata amount to (i) equally and ratably reduce the Notes Obligations in accordance with the procedures set forth under “—Optional redemption” and/or (ii) make an Excess Proceeds Offer; or (2) (A) invest all or any part of the Net Proceeds thereof in capital expenditures or the purchase of assets to be used by us or any Restricted Subsidiary in a Permitted Business, (B) acquire Equity Interests in a Person that is a Restricted Subsidiary or in a Person engaged primarily in a Permitted Business that shall become a Restricted Subsidiary immediately upon the consummation of such acquisition or (C) a combination of (A) and (B). 179 ----- Notwithstanding any other provisions of this covenant, (i) to the extent that any of or all the Net Proceeds of any Asset Sale received or deemed to be received by a Foreign Subsidiary (a “Foreign Disposition”) is (x) prohibited or delayed by applicable local law or (y) restricted by applicable organizational documents in each case, from being repatriated to Canada if the Issuer is organized under the laws of Canada or a political subdivision thereof or the United States, if the Issuer is organized under the laws of the United States or any State thereof or the District of Columbia, an amount equal to the portion of such Net Proceeds so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant so long, but only so long, as the applicable local law or organizational documents will not permit repatriation to the United States or Canada, as applicable, (the Issuer hereby agreeing to use reasonable efforts (as determined in the Issuer’s reasonable business judgment) to otherwise cause the applicable Foreign Subsidiary to within one year following the date on which the respective payment would otherwise have been required, promptly take all actions reasonably required by the applicable local law or applicable organizational impediments to permit such repatriation), and if within one year following the date on which the respective payment would otherwise have been required, such repatriation of any of such affected Net Proceeds is permitted under the applicable local law or applicable organizational impediment, an amount equal to such Net Proceeds will be promptly (and in any event not later than five Business Days after such repatriation could be made) applied (net of additional Taxes payable or reserved against as a result thereof) (whether or not repatriation actually occurs) in compliance with this covenant and (ii) to the extent that the Issuer has determined in good faith that repatriation of any of or all the Net Proceeds of any Foreign Disposition would have an material adverse Tax consequence (which for the avoidance of doubt, includes, but is not limited to, any prepayment out of such Net Proceeds whereby doing so the Issuer, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective affiliates and/or equity owners would incur a Tax liability, including a Tax dividend, deemed dividend pursuant to Code Section 956 or a withholding Tax), an amount equal to the Net Proceeds so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant. The nonapplication of any prepayment amounts as a consequence of the foregoing provisions will not, for the avoidance of doubt, constitute a Default or an Event of Default. Any Net Proceeds from any Asset Sale that are not applied or invested (or committed pursuant to a written agreement to be applied) as provided in the preceding paragraph within 365 days after the receipt thereof and, in the case of any amount committed to a reinvestment, which are not actually so applied within 180 days following such 365 day period shall constitute “Excess Proceeds” and shall be applied pursuant to the succeeding paragraph. Pending the final application of any such Net Proceeds, we or such Restricted Subsidiary may temporarily reduce revolving indebtedness under a Credit Facility, if any, or otherwise invest such Net Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the indenture. When the cumulative amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $30 million, we will be obligated to make an offer to all holders of the Notes (an “Excess Proceeds Offer”) to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes that may be purchased out of such Excess Proceeds at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest to the date fixed for the closing of such offer in accordance with the procedures set forth in the indenture. To the extent we or a Restricted Subsidiary is required under the terms of any First Lien Obligations, we shall also make an offer to the holders of such First Lien Obligations on a pro rata basis with the holders of the Notes, with such proceeds. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and other First Lien Obligations surrendered by holders thereof exceeds the amount of such Excess Proceeds, the Trustee shall select the Notes and other First Lien Obligations and to be purchased on a pro rata basis by lot, and, in the case of global notes, in accordance with the procedures of the depositary. To the extent that the principal amount of Notes tendered pursuant to an Excess Proceeds Offer is less than the amount of such Excess Proceeds, we may use any remaining Excess Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the indenture. Upon completion of an Excess Proceeds Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. We will be required to comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes required in the event of an Excess Proceeds Offer and will not be deemed to have violated the “Excess Proceeds Offer” provisions of the indenture as a result thereof. _Limitation on Liens._ The indenture provides that we shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, incur or assume any Lien (each, an “Initial Lien”) on any asset now owned or hereafter acquired, or on any income or profits therefrom or assign or convey any right to receive income therefrom, other than (i) Permitted Liens and (ii) with respect to Liens on assets not constituting Collateral, any such Lien securing Indebtedness if the 180 ----- Notes are secured equally and ratably thereby (or, if such Indebtedness secured by Liens on assets not constituting Collateral is subordinated to the Notes, the Notes are secured on a priority basis with respect to such Indebtedness). Any Lien created for the benefit of the Holders pursuant to clause (ii) of the preceding sentence shall provide by its terms that such Lien shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon the release and discharge of the Initial Lien. With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time of the incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of property securing Indebtedness. _Additional Subsidiary Guarantees._ The indenture provides that if any of the Issuer’s Restricted Subsidiaries (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Professional Services Affiliates) that is not a Guarantor guarantees or becomes otherwise obligated under a Credit Facility incurred under clause (2) of the second paragraph under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness” or any Capital Markets Indebtedness (including the 2025 Senior Notes and any Financing Notes) in an aggregate principal amount greater than $30 million incurred pursuant to the covenant described above under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness” then in each case such Restricted Subsidiary shall (i) execute and deliver to the Trustee and Collateral Agent a supplemental indenture in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and the Collateral Agent pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary shall unconditionally guarantee all of the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes and the indenture on the terms set forth in the indenture, (ii) execute and deliver to the Trustee and Collateral Agent joinders or supplements, as applicable, to the Collateral Documents and the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement (and, if applicable, any Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement), together with any other filings and agreements (subject to customary extension periods) required by the Collateral Documents to create or perfect the security interests of the Collateral Agent for its benefit and for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes in the Collateral of such Restricted Subsidiary and (iii) deliver to the Trustee and the Collateral Agent an officers’ certificate and an opinion of counsel certifying that such supplemental indenture and joinders or supplements to the Collateral Documents and First Lien Intercreditor Agreement (and, if applicable, any Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement) have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by such Restricted Subsidiary and constitute legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations of such Restricted Subsidiary. Thereafter, such Restricted Subsidiary shall be a Guarantor for all purposes of the indenture, the Collateral Documents and the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement (and, if applicable, any Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement). _Limitation on Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries._ The indenture provides that we shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to: (a) pay dividends or make any other distribution to us or any of our Restricted Subsidiaries on its Capital Stock or with respect to any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits, or pay any Indebtedness owed to us or any of our Restricted Subsidiaries; (b) make loans or advances to us or any of our Restricted Subsidiaries; or (c) transfer any of its properties or assets to us or any of our Restricted Subsidiaries; except for such encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of: (i) Existing Indebtedness and existing agreements as in effect on the Issue Date; (ii) applicable law or regulation; (iii) any instrument governing Acquired Debt and any other agreement or instrument of an acquired Person or any of its Subsidiaries as in effect at the time of acquisition (except to the extent such Indebtedness or other agreement or instrument was incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such acquisition), which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets 181 ----- of any Person, other than the Person, or the property or assets of the Person, so acquired or any of its Subsidiaries; (iv) by reason of customary non-assignment provisions in leases entered into in the ordinary course of business; (v) Refinancing Indebtedness (as defined in the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants— Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness”); provided that the restrictions contained in the agreements governing such Refinancing Indebtedness are no more restrictive than those contained in the agreements governing the Indebtedness being refinanced; (vi) the indenture, the Notes and the Collateral Documents or by our other Indebtedness ranking pari passu with the Notes; provided that except as set forth in clause (vii) below such restrictions are no more restrictive taken as a whole than those imposed by the indenture, the Notes and the Collateral Documents; (vii) any Indebtedness; provided that the restrictions therein are not (i) materially more restrictive than the agreements governing such Indebtedness as in effect on the Issue Date or (ii) will not affect the Issuer’s ability to make principal or interest payments on the Notes (as determined by the Issuer in good faith); (viii) customary non-assignment provisions in contracts, leases, sub-leases and licenses entered into in the ordinary course of business; (ix) any agreement for the sale or other disposition of a Restricted Subsidiary or any of its assets in compliance with the terms of the indenture that restricts distributions by that Restricted Subsidiary pending such sale or other disposition; (x) provisions limiting the disposition or distribution of assets or property (including cash) in joint venture agreements, asset sale agreements, sale-leaseback agreements, stock sale agreements and other similar agreements (including agreements entered into in connection with a Restricted Investment), and customary provisions in joint venture agreements and other similar agreements applicable to the Equity Interests or Indebtedness of such joint venture, which limitation is applicable only to the assets that are the subject of such agreements; (xi) Liens not prohibited by the covenant described above under “—Limitation on Liens”; (xii) any agreement for the sale of any Subsidiary or its assets that restricts distributions by that Subsidiary (or sale of such Subsidiary’s Equity Interests) pending its sale; provided that during the entire period in which such encumbrance or restriction is effective, such sale (together with any other sales pending) would be permitted under the terms of the indenture; (xiii) secured Indebtedness otherwise permitted to be incurred by the indenture that limits the right of the debtor to dispose of the assets securing such Indebtedness; (xiv) Purchase Money Indebtedness that imposes restrictions of the type described in clause (c) above on the property so acquired; (xv) any amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of the contracts, instruments or obligations referred to in clauses (i) through (xiv) above; provided that such amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings are, in our good faith judgment, not materially more restrictive as a whole with respect to such encumbrances and restrictions than those prior to such amendment, modification, restatement, renewal, increase, supplement, refunding, replacement or refinancing; (xvi) Indebtedness or other agreements including, without limitation, agreements described in clause (x) of this paragraph, of any non-Guarantor Subsidiary which imposes restrictions solely on such nonGuarantor Subsidiary and its Subsidiaries; (xvii) any restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers, licensors or lessors or required by insurance, surety or bonding companies, in each case under contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business; or 182 ----- (xviii) restrictions created in connection with any Receivables Facility that, in the good faith determination of the Issuer, are necessary or advisable to effect such Receivables Facility. _Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets._ The indenture provides that we shall not consolidate, amalgamate, participate in an arrangement with or merge with or into (whether or not we are the surviving entity), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our properties or assets in one or more related transactions to, another Person unless: (a) we are the surviving Person or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation, amalgamation, arrangement or merger (if other than us) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition shall have been made is a corporation, limited partnership or limited liability company organized or existing under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or Canada or any political subdivision thereof; provided, however, that if the surviving Person is a limited liability company or limited partnership, such entity shall also form a co-issuer that is a corporation; (b) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation, amalgamation, arrangement or merger (if other than us) or the Person to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition shall have been made assumes all our obligations under the Notes, the indenture, the Collateral Documents and the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement (and, if applicable, any Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement) pursuant to a supplemental indenture and joinders or supplements, as applicable, to the Collateral Documents and the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement (and, if applicable, any Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement), in each case, in form reasonably acceptable to the Trustee and the Collateral Agent; (c) immediately after such transaction, no Event of Default exists; and (d) we or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation, amalgamation, arrangement or merger (if other than us) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition will have been made: (i) will have Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio immediately after the transaction (but prior to any purchase accounting adjustments or accrual of deferred tax liabilities resulting from the transaction) not less than our Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio immediately preceding the transaction or (ii) would, at the time of such transaction after giving pro forma effect thereto as if such transaction had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, be permitted to incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph in the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to the second succeeding paragraph, any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate, amalgamate with, participate in an arrangement with or merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to us or another Restricted Subsidiary. Notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (c) and (d), we may merge or amalgamate with a Restricted Subsidiary solely for the purpose of reorganizing ourselves in another jurisdiction of the United States or any State thereof or the District of Columbia or Canada or any political subdivision thereof so long as the amount of Indebtedness of us and the Restricted Subsidiaries is not increased thereby. The indenture provides that each Guarantor (other than any Guarantor whose Guarantee is to be released in accordance with the terms of such Guarantee and the indenture) will not, and we will not cause or permit any Guarantor to, consolidate, amalgamate, participate in an arrangement with or merge with or into (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving entity) any Person other than us or a Guarantor (in each case, other than in accordance with the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales”) unless: (a) the Guarantor is the surviving Person or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation, amalgamation, arrangement or merger (if other than the Guarantor) is a corporation, limited partnership or limited liability company organized or existing under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (b) the Person formed by or surviving any such consideration, amalgamation or merger (if other than the Guarantor) assumes all the obligations of the Guarantor under the indenture, the Notes, the Collateral Documents and the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement (and, if applicable, any Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement) pursuant to a supplemental indenture and joinders or supplements, as applicable, to the Collateral 183 ----- Documents and the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement (and, if applicable, any Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement), in each case, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and the Collateral Agent; and (c) immediately after such transaction, no Event of Default exists. This section includes a phrase relating to the sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposition of “all or substantially all” of our properties or assets. Although there is a developing body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, if we dispose of less than all our properties or assets by any of the means described above, the application of the covenant described in this section may be uncertain. _Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates._ The indenture provides that we shall not and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of our or their properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or enter into any contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate (including any Unrestricted Subsidiary and Minority Investment) in any one or a series of transactions involving aggregate payments in excess of $20 million (or in the case of a Minority Investment, in excess of $10 million) (each of the foregoing, an “Affiliate Transaction”), unless: (a) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such transaction in arm’s length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and (b) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of $30 million and 15% of Consolidated EBITDA for the most recently ended measurement period calculated on a pro forma basis), the terms of such transaction have been approved by a majority of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer. Any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in clause (b) of this paragraph if such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the disinterested directors of the Issuer, if any. _provided, however, that the following shall, in each case, not be deemed Affiliate Transactions:_ (i) the entry into employment agreements and the adoption of compensation or benefit plans for the benefit of, or the payment of compensation to, directors and management of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries (including, without limitation, salaries, fees, bonuses, equity and incentive arrangements and payments); (ii) indemnification or similar arrangements for officers, directors, employees or agents of us or any of our Restricted Subsidiaries pursuant to charter, bylaw, statutory or contractual provisions; (iii) transactions between or among us and our Restricted Subsidiaries; (iv) Restricted Payments not prohibited by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments” and Permitted Investments; (v) any transactions between us or any of our Restricted Subsidiaries and any Affiliate of us the Equity Interests of which Affiliate are owned solely by us or one of our Restricted Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and by Persons who are not Affiliates of us or Restricted Subsidiaries, on the other hand; (vi) the payment of compensation, fees, costs and expenses to, and indemnities (including under insurance policies) and reimbursements, employment and severance arrangements, and employee benefit and pension expenses provided on behalf of, or for the benefit of, future, current or former employees, directors, officers, managers, contractors, consultants, distributors or advisors of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (whether directly or indirectly); (vii) any agreements or arrangements in effect on the Issue Date and described in this offering memorandum and any modifications, extensions or renewals thereof that are not disadvantageous to the holders of Notes in the Issuer’s reasonable determination in any material respect; (viii) so long as they comply with clause (a) above, transactions with customers, clients, lessors, landlords, suppliers, contractors, or purchasers or sellers of goods or services that are Affiliates, in each case in the ordinary course of business and otherwise in compliance with the terms of the indenture; 184 ----- (ix) transactions with Persons who are Affiliates of us solely as a result of our or a Restricted Subsidiary’s Investment in such Person; (x) sales of Equity Interests to Affiliates of the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries not otherwise prohibited by the indenture and the granting of registration and other customary rights in connection therewith; (xi) transactions with an Affiliate where the only consideration paid is Equity Interests of the Issuer other than Disqualified Stock; (xii) transactions in which the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, deliver to the Trustee a letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is fair to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or meets the requirements of this covenant; (xiii) transactions with joint ventures or Unrestricted Subsidiaries entered into in the ordinary course of business; (xiv) transactions between the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries and any Person, a director of which is also a director of the Issuer; provided, however, that such director abstains from voting as a director on any matter involving such other Person; (xv) any transition services arrangement, supply arrangement or similar arrangement entered into in connection with or in contemplation of the disposition of assets or Capital Stock in any Restricted Subsidiary permitted under “—Limitation on Asset Sales” or entered into with any Business Successor, in each case, that the Issuer determines in good faith is either fair to the Issuer or otherwise on customary terms for such type of arrangements in connection with similar transactions; (xvi) transactions entered into by an Unrestricted Subsidiary with an Affiliate prior to the day such Unrestricted Subsidiary is redesignated as a Restricted Subsidiary (and not entered into in contemplation of such redesignation) as described under “—Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries” and pledges of Capital Stock of Unrestricted Subsidiaries; (xvii) (i) any lease entered into between the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, as lessee, and any Affiliate of the Issuer, as lessor and (ii) any operational services arrangement entered into between the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Issuer, in each case, which is approved as being no worse than a transaction on an arm’s length basis by the reasonable determination of the Issuer; (xviii) intellectual property licenses and research and development agreements in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice; and (xix) any customary transaction with a Receivables Subsidiary effected as part of a Receivables Facility in the ordinary course of business. _Reports._ So long as the notes are outstanding, the indenture will provide that the Issuer will furnish to the holders of the Notes and the Trustee: (1) (x) all annual and quarterly financial statements substantially in forms that would be required to be contained in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on Forms 10-K and 10-Q (or successor forms) of the Issuer, if the Issuer were required to file such forms, plus a “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and (y) with respect to the annual financial statements only, a report on the annual financial statements by the Issuer’s independent registered public accounting firm;

We provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither we nor the initial purchasers are responsible for those operations or procedures. 218 ----- DTC has advised us that it is: - a limited purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York; - a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York State Banking Law; - a member of the Federal Reserve System; - a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code; and - a “clearing agency” registered under Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities for its participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between its participants through electronic book-entry changes to the accounts of its participants. DTC’s participants include securities brokers and dealers, including the initial purchasers; banks and trust companies; clearing corporations and other organizations. Indirect access to DTC’s system is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies; these indirect participants clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a DTC participant, either directly or indirectly. Investors who are not DTC participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through DTC participants or indirect participants in DTC. So long as DTC’s nominee is the registered owner of a global note, that nominee will be considered the sole owner or holder of the Notes represented by that global note for all purposes under the indenture. Except as provided below, owners of beneficial interests in a global note: - will not be entitled to have Notes represented by the global note registered in their names; - will not receive or be entitled to receive physical, certificated Notes; and - will not be considered the owners or holders of the Notes under the indenture for any purpose, including with respect to the giving of any direction, instruction or approval to the Trustee under the indenture. As a result, each investor who owns a beneficial interest in a global note must rely on the procedures of DTC to exercise any rights of a holder of Notes under the indenture (and, if the investor is not a participant or an indirect participant in DTC, on the procedures of the DTC participant through which the investor owns its interest). Payments of principal, premium (if any) and interest with respect to the Notes represented by a global note will be made by the Trustee or the paying agent to DTC’s nominee as the registered holder of the global note. Neither we nor the Trustee nor any paying agent will have any responsibility or liability for the payment of amounts to owners of beneficial interests in a global note, for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of those interests by DTC, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records of DTC relating to those interests. Payments by participants and indirect participants in DTC to the owners of beneficial interests in a global note will be governed by standing instructions and customary industry practice and will be the responsibility of those participants or indirect participants and DTC. Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected under DTC’s procedures and will be settled in same-day funds. Transfers between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way under the rules and operating procedures of those systems. Cross-market transfers between DTC participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be effected within DTC through the DTC participants that are acting as depositaries for Euroclear and Clearstream. To deliver or receive an interest in a global note held in a Euroclear or Clearstream account, an investor must send transfer instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, under the rules and procedures of that system and within the established deadlines of that system. If the transaction meets its settlement requirements, Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will send instructions to its DTC depositary 219 ----- to take action to effect final settlement by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant global Notes in DTC, and making or receiving payment under normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the DTC depositaries that are acting for Euroclear or Clearstream. Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant that purchases an interest in a global note from a DTC participant will be credited on the business day for Euroclear or Clearstream immediately following the DTC settlement date. Cash received in Euroclear or Clearstream from the sale of an interest in a global note to a DTC participant will be received with value on the DTC settlement date but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account as of the business day for Euroclear or Clearstream following the DTC settlement date. DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the above procedures to facilitate transfers of interests in the global Notes among participants in those settlement systems. However, the settlement systems are not obligated to perform these procedures and may discontinue or change these procedures at any time.

Currently, the term “foreign passthru payment” is not defined and it is unclear whether or to what extent payments on the Notes would be considered foreign passthru payments, assuming the Issuer were treated as a foreign financial institution.

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) any estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) any trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more “United States persons” (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or if a valid election is in place to treat the trust as a United States person.",N/A,as_expected,2021,388

Certain Resident Holders that might not otherwise be considered to hold their Notes as capital property may, in certain circumstances, be entitled to have their Notes and all other “Canadian securities” (as defined in the Tax Act) owned in the taxation year of the election and all subsequent taxation years deemed to be capital property by making the irrevocable election permitted by subsection 39(4) of the Tax Act. Such Holders should consult their own tax advisors for advice with respect to whether an election under subsection 39(4) of the Tax Act is available or advisable having regard to their particular circumstances. The following portion of this summary is not applicable to (i) a Holder that is a “financial institution”, as defined in the Tax Act for the purposes of the mark-to-market rules, (ii) a Holder an interest in which would be a “tax shelter investment” as defined in the Tax Act, (iii) a Holder that is a “specified financial institution” as defined in the Tax Act, (iv) a Holder that makes or has made a functional currency reporting election pursuant to section 261 of the Tax Act to report its “Canadian tax results” as defined in the Tax Act in a currency other than Canadian currency or (v) a holder that has entered or will enter into a “derivative forward agreement” as defined in the Tax Act in respect of the Notes. Any such Holder should consult its own tax advisor with respect to an investment in the Notes. 224 ----- _Interest on the Notes_ A Resident Holder of Notes that is a corporation, partnership, unit trust or any trust of which a corporation or a partnership is a beneficiary will be required to include in computing its income for a taxation year any interest on the Notes that accrues or is deemed to accrue to the Resident Holder to the end of the particular taxation year or that has become receivable by, or is received by, the Resident Holder before the end of that taxation year, except to the extent that such interest was included in computing the Resident Holder’s income for a preceding taxation year. Any other Resident Holder, including an individual, will be required to include in computing its income for a taxation year all interest on the Notes that is received or receivable by the Holder in that taxation year (depending upon the method regularly followed by the Resident Holder in computing income), except to the extent that the interest was included in the Resident Holder’s income for a preceding taxation year. In addition, if in any taxation year a note should become an “investment contract” (as defined in the Tax Act) on any “anniversary day” (as defined in the Tax Act) in relation to a Resident Holder (other than a corporation, partnership, unit trust or any trust of which a corporation or a partnership is a beneficiary), such Resident Holder will be required to include in computing income for the taxation year any interest that accrues or is deemed to accrue to the Resident Holder on the Notes up to the end of such anniversary day, to the extent such interest was not otherwise included in the Resident Holder’s income for that year or a preceding year. A Resident Holder of Notes that throughout the relevant taxation year is a “Canadian-controlled private corporation” (as defined in the Tax Act) may be liable to pay a refundable tax on its “aggregate investment income”, which is defined in the Tax Act to include interest income. _Akumin Inc. Assumption_ If this offering is consummated prior to the Acquisition, upon the consummation of the Acquisition, the Escrow Issuer will liquidate into Akumin Inc. and, on the liquidation, Akumin Inc. will assume the obligations of Escrow Issuer under the Indenture and the Notes (for purposes of the disclosure under the heading “Certain Canadian Federal Income Tax Considerations”, the “Assumption”). The Assumption may give rise to a disposition of the Notes by a Resident Noteholder for purposes of the Tax Act. Upon any disposition of a Note as a result of the Assumption, a Resident Noteholder will be deemed to have disposed of the Notes for proceeds equal to the adjusted cost base thereof to such Resident Noteholder immediately before the Assumption and to have reacquired such Notes at a cost equal to the same amount. Accordingly, a Resident Noteholder will not realize any gain or loss as a result of any disposition of a Note on the Assumption. A Resident Noteholder should consult their own tax advisor in this regard. _Redemption, Repayment or Disposition of Notes_ If the Notes are redeemed prior to maturity or are repaid upon maturity, a Resident Holder will be considered to have disposed of the Notes for proceeds of disposition equal to the amount received by the Resident Holder (other than the amount received on account of interest) on such redemption or repayment. The Resident Holder may realize a capital gain or capital loss as described below. Any amount paid by Akumin Inc. or the Escrow Issuer as a penalty or bonus because of early repayment of all or part of the principal amount of the Notes will be deemed to be received by the Resident Holder as interest on the Notes and will be required to be included in the Resident Holder’s income as described above, to the extent such amount can reasonably be considered to relate to, and does not exceed the value at the time of payment of, interest that would otherwise have been payable on the Notes for a taxation year of Akumin Inc. or the Escrow Issuer (as applicable) ending after the payment of such amount. In addition, on a disposition or a deemed disposition of the Notes, including repayment or purchase by Akumin Inc. or the Escrow Issuer, a Resident Holder will generally be required to include in income the amount of interest accrued or deemed to accrue to the date of disposition, to the extent that such amounts have not otherwise been included in the Resident Holder’s income for the year or a preceding taxation year. In general, a disposition or a deemed disposition of Notes by a Resident Holder (excluding any disposition of a Note on the Assumption) will give rise to a capital gain (or a capital loss) equal to the amount by which the proceeds 225 ----- of disposition, net of any amount included in computing the Resident Holder’s income as interest and any reasonable costs of disposition, exceed (or are exceeded by) the adjusted cost base of the Notes to the Resident Holder immediately before the disposition. Generally, one-half of any capital gain (a “taxable capital gain”) realized by a Resident Holder in a taxation year must be included in the Resident Holder’s income for the year, and one-half of any capital loss (an “allowable capital loss”) realized by a Resident Holder in a taxation year must be deducted from taxable capital gains realized by the Resident Holder in that year. Allowable capital losses for a taxation year in excess of taxable capital gains realized in a taxation year generally may be carried back and deducted in any of the three preceding taxation years or carried forward and deducted in any subsequent taxation year against net taxable capital gains realized in such years, to the extent and under the circumstances described in the Tax Act. A Resident Holder of Notes that throughout the relevant taxation year is a “Canadian controlled private corporation” (as defined in the Tax Act) may be liable to pay a refundable tax on its “aggregate investment income”, which is defined in the Tax Act to include taxable capital gains.

The purchase agreement provides that the obligations of the initial purchasers to purchase the Notes are subject to customary closing conditions. The initial purchasers must purchase all the Notes if they purchase any of the Notes. If an initial purchaser defaults, the purchase agreement provides that the purchase commitments of the nondefaulting initial purchasers may be increased or the purchase agreement may be terminated. Prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, the Escrow Issuer has agreed to indemnify the initial purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments the initial purchasers may be required to make in respect of those liabilities. Following the consummation of the Acquisition, the issuer and the guarantors will have jointly and severally agreed to indemnify the initial purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments the initial purchasers may be required to make in respect of those liabilities. The initial purchasers propose to resell the Notes at the offering price set forth on the cover page of this offering memorandum to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers (as defined in Rule 144A) in reliance on Rule 144A and outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S. See “Transfer Restrictions.” The price at which the Notes are offered may be changed at any time without notice. The initial purchasers may offer and sell Notes through certain of their affiliates. The initial purchasers reserve the right to reject, cancel or modify an order of the Notes in whole or in part. The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (as defined in Regulation S) except in transactions exempt from, or not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. See “Transfer Restrictions.” In addition, with respect to the Notes initially sold outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S, until 40 days following the closing of this offering, an offer or sale of Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in this offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act unless the dealer makes the offer or sale in compliance with Rule 144A or another exemption from registration under the Securities Act. We and the guarantors have agreed that during the period from the date of this offering memorandum through and including the date that is 60 days following the date of this offering memorandum, we and the guarantors will not without the prior written consent of the representative, directly or indirectly, offer for sale, sell, or otherwise dispose of (or enter into any transaction or device that is designed to, or would be expected to, result in the disposition by any person at any time in the future), or publicly announce the offering of, or file (or cause to be filed) any registration statement under the Securities Act in respect of, any debt securities of the issuer or the guarantors substantially similar to the Notes offered hereby or securities exchangeable for or convertible into such debt securities of the issuer or the guarantors (other than as contemplated by the purchase agreement), or sell or grant options, rights, or warrants with respect to such debt securities (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such debt securities) or enter into any swap or other derivatives transaction that transfers, in whole or in part, any of 233 ----- the economic benefits or risks of ownership of such debt securities. Such restriction does not prohibit or in any way restrict the issuance of the Notes, the issuance of any Additional Notes of the same series in accordance with the terms of the indenture, or the issuance of any Financing Notes to Stonepeak. There is no established trading market for the Notes. We do not intend to list the Notes on any national securities exchange. We cannot assure you that the prices at which the Notes will sell in the market after this offering will not be lower than the initial offering price or that an active trading market for the Notes will develop and continue after this offering. The initial purchasers have advised us that they currently intend to make a market in the Notes. However, they are not obligated to do so and they may discontinue any market-making activities with respect to the Notes at any time without notice. Accordingly, we cannot assure you as to the liquidity of, or the trading market for, the Notes. You should be aware that the laws and practices of certain countries require investors to pay stamp taxes and other charges in connection with purchases of securities. In connection with the offering, the initial purchasers may purchase and sell Notes in the open market. Purchases and sales in the open market may include short sales, purchases to cover short positions, and stabilizing purchases. Short sales involve sales by the initial purchasers of a greater number of Notes than they are required to purchase in the offering. Covering transactions involve purchases of Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase Notes so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Purchases to cover short positions and stabilizing purchases, as well as other purchases by the initial purchasers for their own accounts, may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the Notes. They may also cause the price of the Notes to be higher than the price that would otherwise exist in the open market in the absence of these transactions. The initial purchasers may conduct these transactions in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. If the initial purchasers commence any of these transactions, they may discontinue them at any time. The initial purchasers are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, corporate advisory, investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing, and brokerage activities. Certain of the initial purchasers and/or their respective affiliates have in the past performed commercial banking, investment banking, and advisory services for us from time to time for which they have received customary fees and reimbursement of expenses and may, from time to time, engage in transactions with and perform services for us in the ordinary course of their business for which they may receive customary fees and reimbursement of expenses. In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the initial purchasers and their respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (which may include bank loans and/or credit default swaps) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers and may at any time hold long and short positions in such securities and instruments. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates. The initial purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. If the initial purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us, certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates routinely hedge, and certain other of the initial purchasers or their affiliates may hedge, their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk-management policies. A typical such hedging strategy would include these initial purchasers or their affiliates hedging such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes. We intend to use net proceeds of this offering, as well as the proceeds from the Initial Financing Notes, the Financing Common Shares and cash on hand, to fund the cash portion of the purchase price for the Acquisition of Alliance, which includes the repayment by the Seller of Alliance debt. See “Use of Proceeds.” Accordingly, certain of the initial purchasers and/or their respective affiliates who are holders of debt of Alliance may receive a portion of the proceeds from this offering. Certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates are or may become lenders and/or agents under the Revolving Credit Facility, for which they receive or will receive customary fees. Barclays Capital Inc. and PNC Capital Markets LLC and/or their respective affiliates are lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and have received or will receive customary fees in connection with the Revolving Credit Facility. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., an affiliate of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, is acting as escrow agent and will receive customary fees in 234 ----- connection therewith. In addition, SVB Leerink LLC is acting as a sell-side advisor to Alliance in connection with the Acquisition and will receive customary fees in connection therewith.",N/A,as_expected,2021,388

Under Rule 15c-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes prior to the date that is two business days preceding the settlement date will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will settle in T+    , to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent failed settlement.

Previously, the Company’s financial statements were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), for the period up to and including the 9-months ended September 30, 2020. On August 28, 2020, the Company filed a Form 40-F with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This filing resulted in the Company becoming an “SEC Issuer” for purposes of National Instrument 51-102 -- Continuous Disclosure Obligations and as such the Company is entitled to prepare and report its financial statements in GAAP as opposed to IFRS. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities and contingencies. Although actual results in subsequent periods may differ from these estimates, such estimates are developed based on the best information available to management and based on management’s best judgments at the time. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience, observable trends and various other ----- ###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 (expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated) assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. All significant assumptions and estimates underlying the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are regularly reviewed and updated when necessary. Changes in estimates are reflected prospectively in the consolidated financial statements based upon on-going trends, or subsequent settlements, and realization depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates. The most significant assumptions and estimates underlying these consolidated financial statements involve accounts receivable, impairments of long-lived assets including goodwill, operating lease right-of-use-assets, income taxes, business combinations and revenue recognition. The significant accounting policies described below have been applied consistently to all periods presented.",N/A,as_expected,2021,388

Subsequently, in December 2020, the Company received an additional grant from the HHS of approximately $4 million and in April 2021, the Company received an additional grant from the HHS of approximately $0.8 million. Additional grants may be available to the Company through subsequent appropriations under this program. The Company applied for these grants after determining that it was eligible to do so. Also, the Company has incurred expenses and experienced loss of revenue that are eligible to be reimbursed under these grants. The grants received are recorded in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) in the category “Other revenue”. ii) During April 2020, the Company received approximately $3.1 million of accelerated Medicare payments under the expanded Accelerated and Advance Payments Program from Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Service (CMS). These payments are required to be applied to claims beginning one year after their receipt through the adjudication of Medicare claims over a future period. These payments to the Company are recorded in the condensed consolidated balance sheets in the category “Accounts payable and accrued liabilities” until earned. iii) The CARES Act allows employers to defer the deposit and payment of the employer's share of Social Security taxes. As of March 31, 2021, such taxes were approximately $2.7 million and approximately $1.3 ----- ###### Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) March 31, 2021 (expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated) million are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets in the category “Accrued payroll taxes” and the remaining balance in the category “Accounts payable and accrued liabilities”. ###### 17 Other investments Effective March 1, 2021, the Company completed a common equity investment in an artificial intelligence business as part of a private placement offering for approximately $4.6 million (it is noted in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows in the category “Investing activities”). The target develops artificial intelligence aided software programs for use in medical businesses, including outpatient imaging services of the sort provided by the Company. As a result of the investment, a previous investment in a convertible note instrument issued by the target to the Company in May 2020 converted for common equity. The Company’s total common equity investment is estimated to be valued at approximately $8.0 million and represents a 34.5% interest in the target on a non-diluted basis. In addition, the Company holds share purchase warrants which, subject to the occurrence of certain events and certain assumptions, and the payment of approximately $0.4 million, would entitle the Company to acquire approximately a further 2.4% interest in the target’s common equity. During the three month period ended March 31, 2021, the Company recognized a gain of approximately $3.4 million on the conversion of the convertible note instrument to common equity and the share purchase warrants. This gain is included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) in the category “Other financial instruments revaluation and other (gains) losses”. ###### 18 Income taxes The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2021 differs from the Canadian statutory rate of 26.5% primarily due to earnings in foreign jurisdictions that are subject to tax rates, which differ from the Canadian statutory tax rate, as well as the impact of valuation allowances applied against losses in jurisdictions for which no tax benefit or expense is recognized. ###### 19 Subsequent events i) On April 1, 2021, the Company announced that it had entered into definitive agreements to acquire six freestanding, fixed-site outpatient diagnostic imaging clinics located in Florida. The acquisitions have an aggregate purchase price of $39 million, subject to certain customary purchase price adjustments. $3.9 million, or 10%, of the aggregate purchase price is to be paid in common shares of Akumin based on the volume-weighted average price for the shares on the NASDAQ for the 20 trading days preceding the closing, subject to a $4.00 per share floor. This transaction closed on May 1, 2021. The Company is in the process of determining the preliminary purchase price allocation. ii) On May 1, 2021, the Company closed a tuck-in acquisition for a single clinic in South Florida for a purchase price of $0.8 million. The Company is in the process of determining the preliminary purchase price allocation. iii) On November 2, 2020, the Company reached a settlement with the sellers of its Georgia business pursuant to the process contemplated by the purchase agreement for that business which valued the ADG Acquisition - Earn-out at approximately $9.4 million. In accordance with the terms of the purchase ----- ###### Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) March 31, 2021 (expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated) agreement between the parties, 50% of the value of ADG Acquisition - Earn-out (approximately $4.7 million) was paid within 5 business days after the value was finally determined, on November 9, 2020.

Under ASC 810, a reporting entity is considered to have a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity (VIE) if (1) the reporting entity has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impacts its economic performance and (2) the reporting entity has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could be potentially significant to the VIE. As a result of the financial relationship established between the Company and the Revenue Practices through respective management service agreements, the Revenue Practices individually qualify as VIEs as the Company, which provides them non-medical, technical and administrative services, has the power to direct their respective activities and the obligation to absorb their gains and losses. As a result, the Company is ----- ###### Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) March 31, 2021 (expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated) considered the primary beneficiary of the Revenue Practices, and accordingly, the assets and liabilities and revenue and expenses of the Revenue Practices are included in these condensed consolidated financial statements. The following information excludes any intercompany transactions and costs allocated by the Company to the Revenue Practices. The Revenue Practices’ total assets and liabilities included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as at March 31, 2021 were $45.8 million (2020 – $57.0 million) and $2.4 million (2020 – $2.4 million), respectively. The assets of the Revenue Practices can only be used to settle their obligations. During the three month period ended March 31, 2021, the Revenue Practices’ net revenue was $41.1 million (2020 – $40.1 million) and the net contribution to the Company’s cash flow from operations was $51.2 million (2020 – $32.7 million). As noted above, the financial information related to the Revenue Practices excludes any intercompany transactions and costs allocated by the Company to the Revenue Practices. The Company also has a variable interest in a single purpose entity in Texas which operates an imaging center, and in certain operations of an imaging center in a separate entity, also in Texas. In both cases, the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entities since it does not have any equity ownership in these entities nor does it have the power to direct the activities of either of these entities that most significantly impact the entities’ economic performance. In both cases, the Company is entitled to a management fee based upon written agreements. The assets and liabilities and revenue and expenses of these entities are not included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company and the Company earned management fee revenue related to these businesses of approximately $0.2 million (2020 - $0.1 million). The Company did not provide any financial or other support to these entities during the periods presented. ###### 5 Property and equipment In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): _Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, and related clarifying standards, which replaces the_ incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to assess credit loss estimates.

This settlement was reached in January 2021. ii) Approximately $1.1 million comprised of a few settlement costs related to four vendors. ###### 24 Non-controlling interests As part of the Texas Acquisition in 2017, certain of PMI’s subsidiaries acquired were non-wholly owned. As a result of operating agreements with each of those non-wholly owned entities, the Company was deemed to have control over those entities and thus 100% of their financial results were included in the Company’s consolidated financial results. The acquired non-controlling interests were recorded in the Company’s consolidated financial statements at their estimated fair value. In May 2018, the Company purchased the noncontrolling interests in seven Texas-based diagnostic imaging companies. During June 2018, (i) the Company purchased the non-controlling interests in Toggle, LLC, a transcription company, for de minimis consideration, and (ii) Preferred Imaging of Tarrant County, LLC, a holding company, distributed its assets to its shareholders and was subsequently terminated.

The 2025 Senior Notes indenture provides for the following (capitalized terms used below in this note and not defined elsewhere in these notes have the respective meanings given to them in the 2025 Senior Notes indenture): - Payments The principal payment is due at maturity on November 1, 2025. Interest is accrued and payable every six months on May 1 and November 1, respectively. - Restrictive covenants The 2025 Senior Notes indenture restricts the Company’s ability to, among other things: incur certain additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock; make certain distributions, investments and other restricted payments; sell certain assets; agree to any restrictions on the ability of Subsidiaries (including the Revenue Practices) to make payments to the Company; create certain liens; merge, consolidate or sell substantially all of the Company’s assets; and enter into certain transactions with affiliates. These covenants are subject to exceptions and qualifications and many of these covenants will not be applicable during any period when the 2025 Senior Notes have an investment grade rating. ----- ###### Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) March 31, 2021 (expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated) - Financial covenants There are no maintenance financial covenants. There are incurrence-based covenants related to the restrictive covenants noted above. The Company is in compliance with the covenants and has no events of default under this indenture as at March 31, 2021. - Events of default Events of default under the 2025 Senior Notes indenture include, among others, failure to pay principal of or interest on the 2025 Senior Notes and certain final judgments when due (subject to appropriate periods and conditions); failure to comply, within appropriate period, with obligations under certain covenants or any provision in the 2025 Senior Notes indenture; certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency and if any Guarantee by a Significant Subsidiary is held in a judicial proceeding to be unenforceable or invalid. The occurrence of an event of default would permit the Trustee or holders of at least 25% of the 2025 Senior Notes to declare all of the 2025 Senior Notes together with unpaid accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable and to exercise other default remedies. 2020 Revolving Facility - ----- ###### Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) March 31, 2021 (expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated) The 2020 Revolving Credit Agreement provides for the following (capitalized terms used below in this note and not defined elsewhere in these notes have the respective meanings given to them in the 2020 Revolving Credit Agreement): - Interest The interest rates payable on the 2020 Revolving Facility are as follows: (i) each Eurodollar Rate Loan bears interest on the outstanding principal amount at Adjusted Eurodollar Rate (effectively, LIBOR) plus the Applicable Rate; (ii) each Base Rate Loan bears interest on the outstanding principal amount at the Base Rate (the highest of (a) the Prime Rate, (b) the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Rate plus 0.5% and (c) one-month Adjusted Eurodollar Rate plus 1.0%) plus the Applicable Rate; and (iii) each Swingline Loan bears interest on the outstanding principal amount at the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate. Since no amount has been drawn under the 2020 Revolving Facility since its inception, the annualized effective interest rate under the 2020 Revolving Credit Agreement during the three months ended March 31, 2021 is not applicable (2020 – nil). With respect to interest rate sensitivity as at March 31, 2021, a 1% increase in variable interest rates would have increased interest expense under the 2020 Revolving Facility for the three months ended March 31, 2021 by $nil (2020 – $nil). - Restrictive covenants In addition to certain covenants, the 2020 Revolving Credit Agreement places limits on the Company’s ability to declare dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock (including options or warrants), prepay, redeem or purchase debt, incur liens and engage in sale-leaseback transactions, make loans and investments, incur additional indebtedness, amend or otherwise alter debt and other material agreements, engage in mergers, acquisitions and asset sales, enter into transactions with affiliates and alter the business the Company and the Subsidiaries currently conduct. - Financial covenant The 2020 Revolving Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant related to a leverage ratio that is tested on the last day of any fiscal quarter (commencing with the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2021) only if on the last day of any such fiscal quarter, the outstanding amount under the 2020 Revolving Facility (excluding certain letter of credit obligations) exceeds 30% of the total commitment under the 2020 Revolving Facility of $55 million. Borrowings under the 2020 Revolving Facility were nil as at March 31, 2021 and therefore did not exceed 30% of the total commitment under the 2020 Revolving Facility. As a result, the Company is in compliance with the financial covenant. No event of default under the 2020 Revolving Credit Agreement had occurred as at March 31, 2021. - Events of default Events of default under the 2020 Revolving Credit Agreement include, among others, failure to pay principal of or interest on the 2020 Revolving Facility when due, failure to pay any fee or other amount due, failure of any loan party to comply with any covenants or agreements in the loan documents (subject to applicable grace periods and/or notice requirements), a representation or warranty contained in the loan documents is incorrect or misleading in a material respect when made, events of bankruptcy and a ----- ###### Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) March 31, 2021 (expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated) change of control.

As at March 31, 2021, the 2025 Senior Notes were measured at fair value under the Level 2 category on recognition. As at March 31, 2021, the Company did not have any derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value under the Level 2 category on recognition and are subsequently remeasured at fair value under the Level 2 category. - Level 3 – inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). As at March 31, 2021, the Company did not have any financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value under the Level 3 category. The Wesley Chapel Loan and ADG Acquisition – Earn-out were measured at fair value under the Level 3 category on recognition. The ADG Acquisition – Earn-out was subsequently remeasured at fair value under the Level 3 category and its value was later determined based on execution of a settlement agreement in November 2020 as discussed in note 6.

With respect to these matters, the management evaluates the developments on a regular basis and accrues a liability when it believes a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. We believe that the amount or any estimable range of reasonably possible or probable loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business and condensed consolidated financial statements. However, the outcome of these matters is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against the Company for amounts in excess of management's expectations, our results of operations and financial condition, including in ----- ###### Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) March 31, 2021 (expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated) a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected. Commencing during Q1 2020 and continuing through the present and beyond, a pandemic relating to the novel coronavirus known as COVID-19 occurred causing significant financial market disruption and social dislocation. The pandemic is dynamic with various cities, counties, states and countries around the world responding or having responded in different ways to address and contain the outbreak, including the declaration of a global pandemic by the World Health Organization, a National State of Emergency in the United States and state and local executive orders and ordinances forcing the closure of non essential businesses and persons not employed in or using essential services to “stay at home” or “shelter in place”. At this stage, we have no certainty as to how long the pandemic, or a more limited epidemic, will last, what regions will be most affected or to what extent containment measures will be applied. Imaging centers are healthcare facilities and as such are generally considered an essential service and expected to continue to operate during any epidemic or pandemic. However, there is potential that actions taken by government, referring physicians or individual actions, in response to containment or avoidance of this coronavirus could impact a patient’s ability or decision to seek imaging services at a given time which could have a significant impact on volume at our imaging centers leading to temporary or prolonged staff layoffs, reduced hours, closures and other cost containment efforts. Further, there is potential that certain services which are not urgent and can be deferred without significant harm to a patient’s health may be delayed, either by the Company in response to local laws or good public health practice or voluntarily by the patient. In addition, there is potential that the outbreak of the coronavirus could impact supply chains, including the Company’s supply of personal protective equipment, and lead to personnel shortages, each of which could impact the ability of the Company to safely perform imaging services. It is also possible that social distancing efforts and sanitization and decontamination procedures could cause delays in the performance of imaging services. Depending on the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is potential for the Company to incur incremental implicit price concessions beyond what is currently expected and potential future reduction in revenue and income and asset impairments. ###### 11 Segmented financial information Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer. The Company has one reportable segment, which is outpatient diagnostic imaging services. ###### 12 Risk management arising from financial instruments The carrying value of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities and leases (current portion) approximates their fair value given their short-term nature. The carrying value of the non-current portion of leases approximates their fair value given the difference between the discount rates used to recognize the liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and the normalized expected market rates of interest is insignificant. The estimated fair values of other non-current liabilities were as follows: ----- ###### Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) March 31, 2021 (expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated) January 1, 2019 62,371,275 123,746,423 1,249,512 1,742,910 1,120,656 2,671,147 64,741,443 128,160,480 Issuance (i) 6,250,000 23,437,500    -    -    - 1,559,418 6,250,000 24,996,918 RSUs and warrants exercised 1,219,653 4,813,632 (436,497) (569,733) (783,156) (2,932,753)   - 1,311,146 Warrants expired   -   - (288,015) (438,798)   -   - (288,015) (438,798) December 31, 2019 69,840,928 151,997,555 525,000 734,379 337,500 1,297,812 70,703,428 154,029,746 Issuance (i)    -    -    -    -    - 14,138    - 14,138 RSUs settled 337,500 1,311,950   -   - (337,500) (1,311,950)   -   Warrants expired   -   - (525,000) (734,379)   -   - (525,000) (734,379) December 31, 2020 70,178,428 153,309,505   -   -   -   - 70,178,428 153,309,505 (i) RSU issuance amount includes stock-based compensation and costs related to RSUs during the period of the consolidated financial statements.

Under ASC 810, a reporting entity is considered to have a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity (VIE) if (1) the reporting entity has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impacts its economic performance and (2) the reporting entity has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could be potentially significant to the VIE.

ASC 606 outlines a single comprehensive model for_ recognizing revenue as performance obligations, defined in a contract with a customer as goods or services transferred to the customer in exchange for consideration, are satisfied. The standard also requires expanded disclosures regarding the Company’s revenue recognition policies and significant judgments used in the determination of revenue. ----- ###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 (expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated) The Company adopted ASC 606 with a full retrospective application. As a result, at the adoption of ASC 606, the majority of what was previously classified as the provision for bad debts in the consolidated statement of operations is now reflected as implicit price concessions (as defined in ASC 606) and therefore included as a reduction to revenue. Net service fee revenue consists of net patient fees received from various payers and patients based on established contractual billing rates, less allowances for contractual adjustments and implicit price concessions. It primarily comprises fees for the use of the Company’s diagnostic imaging equipment and provision of medical supplies. Service fee revenue is recorded during the period in which the Company’s performance obligations are satisfied, based on the estimated collectible amounts from the patients and third party payers. The Company’s performance obligations are satisfied when services are rendered to the patient. Since the gap between payment and delivery of services to patients is generally expected to be less than one year, the Company does not adjust the service fee revenue for a significant financing component, as a practical expedient. Third party payers include federal and state agencies (under the Medicare and Medicaid programs), managed care health plans, commercial insurance companies, attorneys, and employers. Estimates of contractual allowances and the transaction price are based on the terms specified in the related contractual agreements, negotiated rates and historical and expected payment patterns. The Company estimates its expected reimbursement for patients based on the applicable contract terms and negotiated rates. The Company believes its review process enables it to identify instances on a timely basis where such estimates need to be revised. Other revenue consists of miscellaneous fees under contractual arrangements, including service fee revenue under capitation arrangements with third party payers, management fees, government grants and fees for other services provided to third parties. Revenue is recorded during the period in which the Company’s performance obligations under the contract are satisfied by the Company. For 2020, the Company received grants from the U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS). Such grants are outside the scope of ASC 606 and are further discussed in note 25. ASC 606 applies a single model for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers. It requires revenue to be recognized in a manner that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to a customer and at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring those goods or services. This is achieved by applying the following five steps: i) identify the contract with a customer; ii) identify the performance obligation in the contract; iii) determine the transaction price; iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.",N/A,as_expected,2021,388

Income tax is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Current income tax expense represents the amount of income taxes payable based on tax law that is enacted at the reporting date and is adjusted for changes in estimates of tax expense recognized in prior periods. A current tax liability or asset is recognized for income taxes payable, or paid but recoverable, in respect of all periods to date. The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. A deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be available to utilize such amounts. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are adjusted to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefits will be realized. When it appears more likely than not that deferred taxes will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax asset to its estimated realizable value. For net deferred tax assets, estimates of future taxable income are considered in determining whether net deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and the Company intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

Accounting for finance leases remained substantially unchanged (they continue to be recognized on the consolidated balance sheets). The Company’s operating lease portfolio primarily consists of real estate leases for its imaging centres and corporate offices. A smaller portion consists of medical and office equipment leases. The Company elected to use the package of practical expedients offered in the transition guidance that allows management not to reassess lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. The Company also elected to use the accounting policy practical expedients by class of underlying asset to (i) combine associated lease and nonlease components into a single lease component; and (ii) exclude recording short-term leases as right-of-use assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Operating lease liabilities were recorded as the present value of remaining lease payments not yet paid for the lease term discounted using the incremental borrowing rate associated with each lease. Operating lease rightof-use assets represent operating lease liabilities adjusted for prepayments, accrued lease payments, lease incentives and initial direct costs. Certain of the Company’s leases include renewal or termination options. Calculation of operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities includes the initial lease term unless it is reasonably certain a renewal or termination option will be exercised. The Company's initial real estate lease term typically varies from approximately 3 to 10 years. Including renewal options, the lease term may vary from approximately 10 to 30 years. Variable components of lease payments fluctuating with a future index or rate are estimated at lease commencement based on the index or rate at lease commencement. If the payments change as the result of a change in an index or rate subsequent to lease commencement, the difference is recognized in the income statement in the period in which the change occurs. Variable payments for maintenance such as common area maintenance costs and taxes, are not included in determining lease payments and are expensed as incurred. Most of the Company’s leases do not contain implicit borrowing rates, and therefore to measure lease liabilities, the Company used its incremental borrowing rates at the later of the lease commencement date or January 1, 2019.

The update provides a framework for evaluating whether a transaction should be accounted for as_ an acquisition and/or disposal of a business versus assets. In order for a purchase to be considered an acquisition of a business, and receive business combination accounting treatment, the set of transferred assets and activities must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. If substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, then the set of transferred assets and activities is not a business. As a result of adoption on January 1, 2019, there was no impact on our consolidated financial statements, and we have applied the guidance to subsequent acquisitions. The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition accounting method. The total purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on fair values as at the date of acquisition. Goodwill as at the acquisition date is measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquired company over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Any non-controlling interests in the acquired company are measured at their fair value. Best estimates and assumptions are used in the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the business combination date.

They are recognized initially at net realizable value and are subsequently measured at amortized cost less loss allowances. In addition to the implicit price concessions considered and recorded when the service was performed, at each reporting period, the Company estimates the expected credit losses based on a combination of probability-weighted historic and actual bad debts experience with consideration of forwardlooking information including changes to economic conditions that would impact its customers (such as unemployment rate and general economic environment for non-individual payors). During the period affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, management’s consideration of those changes to economic conditions included the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Accounts receivable are considered to be in default when customers have failed to make the contractually required payments when due. Implicit price concessions are recorded as a reduction in revenue with an offsetting amount reducing the carrying value of the receivable. When a receivable is considered uncollectible, the receivable is written off against the allowance for bad debts account. In the fourth quarter of 2020, due to slow down in collections of receivables, the Company changed its estimates of the implicit price concessions related to its customers, primarily based on historical experience of collections impacted by the pandemic and the integration of diagnostic imaging centers acquired in 2018 and 2019.

The methodology used to test impairment is classified as Level 3 per the fair value hierarchy described in note 16. The fair value for a reporting unit is determined by discounting five-year cash flow projections (cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using perpetuity growth rates). These projections reflect management’s expectations based on past experience and future estimates of operating performance. The discount rates are applied to the cash flow projections and are derived from the weighted average cost of capital for each reporting unit or group of reporting units. The Company’s discount rates are based on market rates of return, debt to equity ratios, and certain risk premiums, among other things. The perpetuity growth rates are based on expected economic conditions and a general outlook for the industry. An impairment charge is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. No impairment charges have arisen as a result of the reviews performed as at October 1, 2020. Reasonably possible changes in key assumptions would not cause the recoverable amount of goodwill to fall below the carrying amount. As there were no indicators of impairment for any of the reporting units, management has not updated any of the other impairment calculations as at December 31, 2020. ----- ###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 (expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated) ###### 7 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities The accounts payable and accrued liabilities are as follows: **2020** **2019 $** **$** Accounts payable 20,400,949 21,707,080 Accrued other expenses 10,034,409 2,602,292 Accrued payroll expenses 3,797,784 1,952,853 34,233,142 26,262,225 ###### 8 Earn-out liability (ADG Acquisition) **2020 2019 $** **$** ADG Acquisition – earn-out 4,688,553 14,834,067 Less: Current portion of ADG Acquisition – earn-out (4,688,553) (7,529,962) Non-current portion of ADG Acquisition – earn-out - 7,304,105 A portion of the purchase price payable in respect of the ADG Acquisitions in 2019, specifically for SFL Radiology Holdings, LLC (Georgia business), was subject to an earn-out (the ADG Acquisition – earn-out liability) based on its annualized revenues earned in the first two quarters of 2020 less certain costs including certain operating expenses, capital expenditures and incremental working capital. In accordance with the purchase agreement, 50% of this liability was settled in the latter half of 2020 and the balance is expected to be settled in the first half of 2021. The value of the ADG Acquisition – earn-out liability was estimated by management using a probability weighted valuation technique related to information including revenue and operating expenses; changes in the fair value of this liability are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Management estimated the fair value of the ADG Acquisition – earn-out liability as at May 31, 2019 at approximately $14.7 million based on a discount rate of approximately 7% and management’s estimated probability weighted range of the ADG Acquisition – earn-out liability (it is considered a Level 3 liability as described in note 16; this liability was subsequently settled as noted below). An increase in the discount rate by 1.0% point decreased the value of this liability by about $0.2 million and vice versa. Subsequently, the ADG Acquisition – earn-out liability estimate was revalued at approximately $14.8 million as at December 31, 2019. This liability was revalued at approximately $9.4 million based on a settlement reached pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement in November 2020 with the representatives of the sellers of the Company’s Georgia business and the change in fair value was recognized in financial instruments revaluation in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Fifty percent of this liability was paid in November 2020 and the balance is to be paid in May 2021 pursuant to the process outlined in the related purchase agreement. During the twelve month period ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized a gain of approximately $5.5 million due to changes in fair value of the ADG Acquisition – earn-out liability (2019 – loss of approximately $0.1 million). ----- ###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 (expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated) ###### 9 Lease liabilities",N/A,as_expected,2021,388

In addition, among other things, the amendment adjusted Akumin’s leverage and fixed charge ratios for the four quarters ended March 31, 2021, providing the Company with greater flexibility in its financial ratio covenants. Sixteen million dollars of the Term Loan A was subject to a delayed draw, which was drawn by the Company in October 2019 to partly finance the West Palm Beach Acquisition. The term of the Amended May 2019 Loans is five years from May 31, 2019. The Amended May 2019 Loans can be increased by an additional $100,000,000 subject to certain conditions.

This derivative financial instrument has an underlying notional amount of 100% of the face value of Term Loan B ($266,000,000 as at July 31, 2019) and a termination date of July 31, 2022 with (i) a cap rate of 3.00% (LIBOR) per annum, and (ii) a floor rate of 1.1475% (LIBOR) per annum. There was no upfront cost of this derivative financial instrument. The Company has not designated this interest rate cap agreement as a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes. On November 2, 2020, this derivative financial instrument was terminated and settled completely for $4,805,000 (2019 liability $951,702) and a loss for the year-ended December 31, 2020 of approximately $3.9 million was recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) in the line “Financial instruments revaluation and other (gains) losses”. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company incurred interest expense of $1,301,854 (2019 - $nil) with respect to this derivative financial instrument. The interest expense was paid on a monthly basis. The settlement payment with respect to this derivative financial instrument in the cashflow statement is included in the line “Loan repayments”.",N/A,as_expected,2021,388

Based on management’s assessment of the future profitability of the Company’s Canadian operations, as at December 31, 2020, a valuation allowance of $2,634,364 (2019 – $2,800,607) has been recorded to recognize only the portion of the deferred tax asset that is more likely than not to be realized. Management’s assessment of the future profitability of the Company’s US operations has determined that the deferred tax assets related to the US operations are more likely than not to be realized and a valuation allowance against these existing deferred tax assets should not currently be required. The amount of the deferred tax assets is considered realizable, however, it could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carry-forward period are reduced or increased. The Company has made a significant investment in its US operations and asserts that earnings from such operations will be indefinitely reinvested in the US. Therefore, determination of unrecognized deferred tax liability on outside basis differences is not practicable at this time. The Company has operating loss carry-forwards of $68,755,558(2019 – $16,226,326), of which $19,742,894 begin to expire in 2036. Of these loss-carryforwards, $49,012,664 do not expire but are subject to utilization restrictions. The Company also has a Section 163(j) interest expense carryforward of $24,670,177 (2019 – $1,007,969) which does not expire but is subject to utilization restrictions. Tax years 2017-2019 and 2016-2019 remain subject to examination by the tax authorities in the US and Canada, respectively. ###### 14 Commitments and contingencies The Company is party to various legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business. With respect to these matters, the management ----- ###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 (expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated) evaluates the developments on a regular basis and accrues a liability when it believes a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. We believe that the amount or any estimable range of reasonably possible or probable loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements. However, the outcome of these matters is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against the Company for amounts in excess of management's expectations, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected. Commencing during Q1 2020 and continuing through the present and beyond, a pandemic relating to the novel coronavirus known as COVID-19 occurred causing significant financial market disruption and social dislocation. The pandemic is dynamic with various cities, counties, states and countries around the world responding or having responded in different ways to address and contain the outbreak, including the declaration of a global pandemic by the World Health Organization, a National State of Emergency in the United States and state and local executive orders and ordinances forcing the closure of non essential businesses and persons not employed in or using essential services to “stay at home” or “shelter in place”. At this stage, we have no certainty as to how long the pandemic, or a more limited epidemic, will last, what regions will be most affected or to what extent containment measures will be applied. Imaging centers are healthcare facilities and as such are generally considered an essential service and expected to continue to operate during any epidemic or pandemic. However, there is potential that actions taken by government, referring physicians or individual actions, in response to containment or avoidance of this coronavirus could impact a patient’s ability or decision to seek imaging services at a given time which could have a significant impact on volume at our imaging centers leading to temporary or prolonged staff layoffs, reduced hours, closures and other cost containment efforts. Further, there is potential that certain services which are not urgent and can be deferred without significant harm to a patient’s health may be delayed, either by the Company in response to local laws or good public health practice or voluntarily by the patient. In addition, there is potential that the outbreak of the coronavirus could impact supply chains, including the Company’s supply of personal protective equipment, and lead to personnel shortages, each of which could impact the ability of the Company to safely perform imaging services. It is also possible that social distancing efforts and sanitization and decontamination procedures could cause delays in the performance of imaging services. Depending on the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is potential for the Company to incur incremental credit losses beyond what is currently expected and potential future reduction in revenue and income and asset impairments. ###### 15 Stock-based compensation – options The Company operates an equity-settled, stock options based payment compensation plan, under which the Company pays equity instruments of the Company as consideration in exchange for services received. The fair value of the grant of options is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) as an expense. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted. The total expense is recognized over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the service vesting conditions are to be satisfied. The maximum number of common shares reserved for issuance, in the aggregate, under the Company’s option plan (and under any other share compensation arrangements of the Company) is 10% of the aggregate number of common shares which are outstanding from time to time. As at December 31, 2020, this represented 7,017,842 (2019 – 6,984,092) common shares. ----- ###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 (expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)",N/A,as_expected,2021,388

During the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, the Company granted approximately 1.7 million stock options on November 18, 2019, to purchase common shares on a 1:1 basis with an exercise price of $3.29 per share. The fair value of the stock options granted during 2019 was determined to be $2.4 million. These options will vest over a three-year period from the date of issue (34%, 33% and 33% per year, respectively) and have an expiry date of seven years from the date of issue. The fair value of the stock options granted during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was estimated to be $1.4364 per option using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on the following assumptions.

The total grant date fair value of stock options that vested during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was $1.8 million (2019 – $1.7 million). During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a total stock-based options compensation expense of approximately $2,069,777 (2019 – $1,995,347). The total compensation cost related to unvested options awards not yet recognized is approximately $1,089,614 (2019 – $3,185,813) and will be recognized over a remaining vesting period of 1.88 years (2019 – 2.88 years). ###### 16 Risk management arising from financial instruments The carrying value of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities and leases (current portion) approximates their fair value given their short-term nature. The carrying value of the non-current portion of leases approximates their fair value given the difference between the discount rates used to recognize the liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and the normalized expected market rates of interest is insignificant. The estimated fair values of other non-current liabilities were as follows: **2020** **2019 $** **$** 2025 Senior Notes 424,016,044     Amended May 2019 loans payable     - 360,596,500 Wesley Chapel Loan payable 1,122,400 1,483,830 Subordinated note – earn-out     - 184,485 ADG Acquisition – earn-out 4,688,553 14,834,067 Derivative financial instruments      - 951,105 429,826,997 378,049,987 Financial instruments recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets are classified using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements. The fair value hierarchy has the following levels: - Level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Pricing inputs are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. For securities, the valuations are based on quoted prices of the securities that are readily and regularly available in an active market, and accordingly, a significant degree of judgment is not required. As at December 31, 2020, the Company did not have any financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value under the Level 1 category. ----- ###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 (expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated) - Level 2 – inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability; either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices) Pricing inputs are based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. The estimated fair value of the liabilities that are recognized at fair value, and subsequently measured at amortized cost, are determined using Level 2 inputs primarily related to comparable market prices. As at December 31, 2020, the 2025 Senior Notes and derivative financial instruments were measured at fair value under the Level 2 category on recognition. The derivative financial instruments are subsequently remeasured at fair value under the Level 2 category. - Level 3 – inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) Pricing inputs are generally unobservable for the assets or liabilities and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the investment. The inputs into the determination of fair value require management’s judgment or estimation of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities. The fair values are therefore determined using model based techniques that include option pricing models, discounted cash flow models, and similar techniques. The Amended May 2019 Loans, Wesley Chapel Loan, Subordinated Note – Earn-out, and ADG Acquisition – Earn-out were measured at fair value under the Level 3 category on recognition. The ADG Acquisition – Earnout and Subordinated Note – Earn-out were subsequently remeasured at fair value under the Level 3 category. The Amended May 2019 Loans and Subordinated Note – Earn-out were settled completely during the three months ended December 31, 2020 as discussed in notes 10 and 11. The liability related to the ADG Acquisition – Earn-out was determined based on execution of a settlement agreement in November 2020 as discussed in note 8.

On November 1, 2020, the Company acquired an MRI machine from an entity in which an officer of a subsidiary of the Company holds a significant interest for $400,000, which has been paid in full. The MRI machine is to be installed in one of the Company’s diagnostic imaging facilities in Florida. There are no ongoing contractual or other commitments resulting from the transaction. On February 8, 2018, Akumin Corp. entered into a contract with the President and Chief Executive Officer, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Secretary (collectively, the Pledgors) to loan an aggregate of $500,000 in connection with the purchase by such Pledgors of a total of 142,857 common shares of the Company from certain selling security holders of PMI, pursuant to the terms of a put and call option agreement made as of August 9, 2017 between Z Strategies Inc., a company controlled by the President and Chief Executive Officer, and certain selling security holders of PMI. This loan charged interest at 6% per annum and was payable on maturity at February 8, 2021. During 2019, the Pledgors completely paid off this loan and accrued interest. ###### 18 New accounting standards The standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuance of the Company’s consolidated financial statements are disclosed below.

Subsequently, in December 2020, the Company received an additional grant from the HHS of approximately $4.1 million. Additional grants may be available to the Company through subsequent appropriations under this program. The Company applied for these grants after determining that it was eligible to do so. Also, the Company has incurred expenses and experienced loss of revenue that are eligible to be reimbursed under these grants. The grants received are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations comprehensive income (loss) in the category “Other revenue”. ii) During April 2020, the Company received approximately $3.1 million of accelerated Medicare payments under the expanded Accelerated and Advance Payments Program from Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Service (CMS). These payments are currently required to be applied to claims beginning one year after their receipt through the adjudication of Medicare claims over a future period. These payments to the Company are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets in the category “Accounts payable and accrued liabilities” until earned. iii) The CARES Act allows employers to defer the deposit and payment of the employer's share of Social Security taxes. As of December 31, 2020, such taxes were approximately $2.7 million and approximately $1.3 million are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets in the category “Accrued payroll taxes” and the remaining balance in the category “Accounts payable and accrued liabilities”. ###### 26 Subsequent events i) The Company announced on February 11, 2021 that it completed its private offering of $75 million aggregate principal amount of additional 7.00% senior secured notes due November 2025 (the “New Notes”). The New Notes were offered as additional notes under the same indenture as the previously issued 2025 Senior Notes and will be treated as a single series with the 2025 Senior Notes. The Company expects to use the net proceeds from this offering for future acquisitions, with any unused proceeds to be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes, which may include reducing debt. The New Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior secured basis by each wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, including the Revenue Practices and the guarantors. ii) Effective March 1, 2021, the Company completed a common equity investment in an artificial intelligence business as part of a private placement offering for approximately $4.6 million. The target develops artificial intelligence aided software programs for use in medical businesses, including outpatient imaging services of the sort provided by the Company. As a result of the investment, a previous investment in a convertible note instrument issued by the target to the Company in May 2020 converted for common equity. The Company’s total investment is estimated to be valued at approximately $8.0 million and represents a 34.5% interest in the target. In addition, the Company holds share purchase warrants which, ----- ###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 (expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated) subject to the occurrence of certain events, and the payment of approximately $0.4 million, would entitle the Company to acquire a further 2.4% interest in the target’s common equity. iii) On March 9, 2021, the Board granted 645,000 RSUs and 70,000 options to certain employees and consultants of the Company pursuant to the Company's RSU plan and stock option plan, respectively, in connection with the Company's equity bonus awards. In addition, 84,032 RSUs were granted to nonexecutive directors of the Company as part of their 2021 compensation and 50,000 RSUs were awarded as part of a signing bonus to an executive who started with the Company on March 29, 2021. Subject to and in accordance with the terms of the RSU plan, 50% of the RSUs granted will vest and settle for common shares one year after the date of grant and the remaining 50% will vest and settle for common shares two years after the date of grant. Subject to and in accordance with the stock option plan, the options were granted with an exercise price of $3.58 per share, representing the 5-day volume weighted average price of the shares prior to the date of grant and an expiry date of 7 years after the date of grant. The options granted will vest as follows: 34% of the grant vest one year after the date of grant, 33% two years after the date of grant and the remaining 33% three years after the date of grant. ----- # [Alliance HealthCare Services, Inc. ] ###### Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements March 31, 2021 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,388

(the “Company” or “Alliance”) and do not include all of the information and disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”). In the opinion of management, all normal recurring accruals and adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. The results for the three months ended March 31, 2021 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2021. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 (“2020 Annual Report”). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, provision for the collectibility of accounts receivable, goodwill and other intangible assets, and assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions. Actual results could differ from these estimates and such differences could affect the results of operations reported in future periods. _Pending Acquisition by Akumin Corp._ On June 25, 2021, the Company entered into a share purchase agreement (the “Share Purchase Agreement”) with Akumin Corp., a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Akumin Inc. Pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement, Akumin Corp. will acquire all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Thaihot Investment Company US Limited, which owns 100% of the common stock of Alliance, from Thaihot Investment Co., LTD (the “Seller”). The aggregate purchase price payable to the Seller at closing is $820 million (the “Purchase Price”). The transaction is subject to the receipt of certain regulatory approvals, as well as the satisfaction or waiver of other customary closing conditions. The Share Purchase Agreement provides for the payment by Akumin Corp. of a reverse break fee to the Seller equal to: (a) 5.0% of the Purchase Price in connection with the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement under certain circumstances, including a material breach by Akumin Corp. of any covenant, representation or warranty contained in the Share Purchase Agreement; and (b) 2.5% of the Purchase Price in connection with the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement because of a failure to obtain certain regulatory approvals by an agreed upon date.

This ASU is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. Early adoption is permitted and can be applied either retrospectively or prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. The Company adopted ASU 2018-15 on January 1, 2021 on a prospective basis.

ASU 2016-02 supersedes the current standard. The primary difference between current guidance and ASU 2016-02 is the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP. ASU 2016-02 also requires an entity to separate the lease components from the non-lease components (for example, maintenance services or other activities that transfer a good or service to the customer) in a contract. Only the lease components must be accounted for in accordance with this guidance. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10, “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842): Effective Dates.” ASU 2019-10 deferred the effective date for ASU 2016-02 by one year for smaller reporting companies, non-SEC filers and all other companies. Subsequently, in June 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-05, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) and Leases (Topic 842),” which grants a one-year effective date deferral. Therefore, ASU 2016-02 is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022.

In May 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-05, “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Targeted Transition Relief,” which provides additional implementation guidance on the previously issued ASU 2016-13.

This guidance was effective beginning on March 12, 2020, and can be adopted on a prospective basis no later than December 31, 2022, with early adoption permitted. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848).” The objective of the new reference rate reform standard is to clarify the scope of Topic 848 and provide explicit guidance to help companies applying optional expedients and exceptions. These ASUs are effective immediately for all entities that have applied optional expedients and exceptions.

The Company has elected to use the income approach to value these derivatives, using observable Level 2 market expectations at the measurement date and standard valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount assuming that participants are motivated but not compelled to transact. Level 2 inputs for interest rate swap valuations are limited to quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets (specifically futures contracts on LIBOR for the first two years) and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (specifically LIBOR cash and swap rates at commonly quoted intervals and implied volatilities for options). According to Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 820, “Fair Value Measurement,” the fair value measurement of an asset or liability must reflect the nonperformance risk of the entity and the counterparty. Therefore, the impact of the counterparty’s creditworthiness and the Company’s creditworthiness has also been factored into the fair value measurement of the derivative instruments.

Included in Major equipment and Transportation and service equipment as of December 31, 2020 are assets held under capital leases with a cost of $42.6 million and $2.8 million, respectively, and accumulated depreciation of $24.9 million and $1.3 million, respectively. Intangible assets consist of the following: The CARES Act provided for the deferred payment of the employer portion of Social Security taxes between March 27, 2020 and December 31, 2020, with 50% of the deferred amount due December 31, 2021 and the remaining 50% due December 31, 2022. The Company elected to defer depositing the employer’s share of Social Security taxes beginning in April 2020. As of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, $5.7 million related to these deferred payments are included in accrued compensation and related expenses in the consolidated balance sheet. The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss are as follows: As of March 31, 2021, the Company had interest rate swap agreements to hedge a total of $306.9 million of its variable-rate bank debt or approximately 54% of total variable-rate debt. At December 31, 2020, the Company had interest rate swap agreements to hedge $307.9 million of its variable-rate bank debt or approximately 54% of total variable-rate debt. The amount that the Company expects to reclassify from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense over the next twelve months is $6.3 million. A summary of the Company’s derivative liabilities is as follows: In the normal course of business, the Company has made certain guarantees and indemnities, under which it may be required to make payments to a guaranteed or indemnified party, in relation to certain transactions. The Company indemnifies other parties, including customers, lessors, and parties to other transactions with the Company, with respect to certain matters. The Company has agreed to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract, which may include, for example, litigation or claims arising from a breach of representations or covenants. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its executive officers and directors and the Company’s bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations. Under these arrangements, the Company is obligated to indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, its current or former officers and directors for various amounts incurred with respect to actions, suits or proceedings in which they were made, or threatened to be made, a party as a result of acting as an officer or director. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made related to these indemnifications have been immaterial. At March 31, 2021, the Company has determined that no liability is necessary related to these guarantees and indemnities. Restructuring charges of $0.6 million and $0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, consist of exit costs primarily associated with leased facilities that the Company ceased using.

Included in other accrued liabilities at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 is $6.1 million of MAAPP funds.

Future income tax benefits are recognized only to the extent that the realization of such benefits is considered to be more likely than not. The Company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance, when it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will not be recoverable, based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes,” which is intended to simplify various aspects related to accounting for income taxes.

The carrying amounts of variable-rate borrowings approximate fair value estimates based on current market rates and credit spreads for similar debt instruments. - **Derivative instruments: Fair value is determined based on the income approach and standard valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount and approximates the net gains and losses that would have been realized if the contracts had been settled at each period-end. ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurement,” applies to all assets and liabilities that are being measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis. ASC 820 requires disclosure that establishes a framework for measuring fair value by establishing a hierarchy for ranking the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values. ASC 820 requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: Level 1** Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2** Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs, including identical securities in inactive markets or similar securities in active markets that are corroborated by market data; or Level 3** Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.",N/A,as_expected,2021,388

AI is the sole owner of The Pain Center of Arizona (“TPC”). Prior to the AI Sale, AI owned 60% of the membership interests in Alliance Interventional-Florida, LLC (“AHIPFL”). Prior to the AI Sale, the joint venture partners of AI assigned their indirect membership interest in AHIP-FL to the Company so that AI no longer had a membership interest in AHIP-FL. In connection with the joint venture partners’ assignment of their indirect ownership in AHIP-FL, the Company reclassified $2.2 million from noncontrolling interest to additional paid-in capital, which primarily represents the accumulated deficit allocated to the assigned noncontrolling interest. The total consideration received for the AI Sale was $15.0 million, consisting of $1.25 million in cash paid at closing and a $13.75 million promissory note due from the joint venture partners. The promissory note requires various principal payments during its term and is due on December 31, 2023. The promissory note bears interest at an annual interest rate of 9% through December 31, 2022 and 10% from January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2023. The promissory note is collateralized by a first priority security interest in all assets of AI and subsidiaries and secured by a pledge from the joint venture partners of a first priority security interest in their equity interests in AI.

Although vaccines have recently been approved for use, the availability and distribution of the vaccines continue to provide challenges to the control of the virus. During 2020, many of the Company-owned and customer operating sites were impacted by temporary closures or reduced operating hours. As a result, the Company experienced a reduction in procedure volumes and corresponding revenues. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate length or severity of this pandemic, nor the impact on its future procedure volumes and revenues. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic ultimately impacts the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity may differ from management’s current estimates due to inherent uncertainties regarding the duration and further spread of the outbreak, its severity, actions taken to contain the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. In response to this market condition, the Company took a number of actions in 2020 to mitigate the impact to the Company’s future results of operations and cash flows, as well as to protect its financial position. These actions included, but are not limited to, the following: - Furloughed, reduced the hours for or eliminated the positions of a substantial number of employees; - Reduced compensation for executive and management employees; - Implemented certain other cost reductions; - Deferred spending on capital expenditures; and - Borrowed on its revolving loan facility as a precautionary measure to increase the Company’s cash position and help maintain financial flexibility. In addition, the Company entered into amendments to its Credit Agreements (see Note 7) during 2020. The amendments provided for, among other things, the amendment to certain financial covenants. As a result of the actions taken by the Company and its projected operating results, management expects that the Company will be in compliance with the debt covenants under the Credit Agreements for at least the next twelve months. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) was signed into law. The CARES Act includes, among other things, a number of benefits that are applicable to the Company and other healthcare providers, provisions relating to the deferment of the employer portion of social security tax payments, as well as changes to federal income tax law including increases to the limit on the deduction for net interest expense and acceleration of the timing for refunds of alternative minimum tax credits. In addition, the Company received payments in connection with certain provisions of the CARES Act including: (i) advanced Medicare payments and (ii) government grants to compensate for healthcare related expenses or lost revenues [attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic (see Note 6). On December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 was signed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_Appropriations_Act,_2021) into law, which provided additional stimulus relief and renewed some CARES Act programs that had expired. Accounts receivable are reported at realizable value, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, which are estimated and recorded in the period the related revenue is recorded. The Company has a standardized approach to estimate and review the collectability of its receivables based on a number of factors, including the age of the receivable balances. Changes to the allowance for doubtful accounts estimates are recorded as an adjustment to bad debt expense within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. Receivables deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts at the time such receivables are written-off. In accordance with ASC 350, the Company performs an annual impairment test in the fourth quarter for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Such indicators include a significant decline in expected future cash flows due to changes in company-specific factors or the broader business climate. In evaluating goodwill for impairment, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likelythan-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company concludes that it is more-likely-thannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company conducts a quantitative goodwill impairment test. First, for each reporting unit, the Company compares its estimated fair value with its net book value. If the estimated fair value exceeds its net book value, goodwill is deemed not to be impaired, and no further testing is necessary. If the estimated fair value does not exceed its net book value, goodwill is deemed to be impaired. The Company records an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The quantitative impairment analysis utilizes two primary approaches to calculate the fair value of the reporting unit: the discounted cash flow (“DCF”) method and the Guideline Public Company (“GPC”) method. Under the DCF method, fair value is measured as the present worth of anticipated future net cash flows generated by a business. In a multi-period model, net cash flows attributable to a business are forecast for an appropriate period and then discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. In a single-period model, net cash flow or earnings for a normalized period are capitalized to reach a determination of present value. The methods, key assumptions, degree of uncertainty associated with the key assumptions and the potential events or changes in circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the key assumptions with respect to the reporting unit are the estimated future net cash flows generated and the discount rate applied to capture the associated risks. The ability to achieve anticipated future net cash flows is subject to numerous assumptions and risks, including company-specific risks such as the ability to maintain and grow revenues, maintain or improve operating margins, control costs and anticipate working capital requirements. The anticipated future net cash flows are also dependent on industry-level factors, such as the impact of legislature, on patient volumes and cost-reimbursement levels and continued availability of qualified doctors and other medical professionals who are necessary to staff the Company’s operations, among other potential impacts. Under the GPC method, value is estimated by comparing the subject company to similar companies with publicly-traded ownership interests. Guideline companies are selected based on comparability to the subject company, and valuation multiples are calculated and applied to subject company operating data. The key assumption used in connection with the GPC method focuses on identifying guideline companies that operate in the same (or similar) line of business as the reporting units with the same (or similar) operating characteristics. Eligible companies are selected based on Global Industry Classification Standard codes, Standard Industrial Classification codes, company descriptions, and industry affiliations. Considered factors include relative risk, profitability, and growth considerations of the reporting unit relative to the guideline companies. Value estimates for the reporting unit involve using multiples of market value of invested capital excluding cash to revenue and earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”). Valuations derived using the GPC method rely on information primarily obtained from available industry market data and publicly available filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). In testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If the Company concludes that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, the Company conducts a quantitative impairment test, which consist of a comparison of the fair value to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis and are reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC 360, “Property, Plant, and Equipment.” undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Pursuant to ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue in the period in which performance obligations are satisfied by transferring goods or services to customers. The Company records the amount of revenue that reflects the consideration that it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company applies the following five-step model in order to determine this amount: (i) identification of the contract with a customer; (ii) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract and determination of whether they represent performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation. The Company applied the modified retrospective approach when adopting ASC 606 and applied the practical expedient permitted under ASC 606 to those contracts that were not completed as of the date of initial adoption. Under the modified retrospective approach, the Company recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard as an adjustment to opening retained earnings at the date of initial application. The Company was required to capitalize costs to acquire new contracts, whereas previously, the Company expensed those costs as incurred. As a result, as of January 1, 2019, the Company capitalized $1.3 million ($1.0 million net of tax) of deferred sales commissions related to open contracts, which are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet, and are amortized over the remaining weighted average contract term of three years. Sales commissions for contracts obtained after December 31, 2018 are capitalized and amortized over the service period of the respective contract. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the impact of recording sales commission expense under ASC 606 was not materially different from what would have been recorded under legacy GAAP. In addition, as a result of adopting ASC 606, uncollectible balances associated with patient responsibility from the Company’s Retail operations are now reflected as implicit price concessions (as defined in ASC 606) and therefore included as a reduction to net revenues whereas historically these amounts were classified as bad debt expense and included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded $1.6 million of implicit price concessions as a direct reduction of net revenues that would have been recorded as bad debt expense prior to the adoption of ASC 606. Other than these changes in presentation on the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss, the adoption of ASC 606 did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019. Wholesale Wholesale revenues are derived from services provided under an outsourced contract arrangement with hospitals, physician groups and other healthcare providers. Under outsourced service contracts with wholesale customers, the Company provides medical services to patients at a fixed site facility or mobile unit. The Company typically bundles its services in providing diagnostic imaging or radiation therapy services, staffing, supplies and other patient related administrative tasks depending on the customers’ needs. The majority of the Company’s contracts have a single performance obligation, as a series of distinct services that are substantially the same are provided and are transferred with the same pattern to the customer. The Company bills customers either on a fee per procedure, percentage of collections, or fixed-payment methodology. Service fees based on fee per procedure and fixed-payment methodology are negotiated and agreed upon by both parties. The Company does not have a business practice of accepting less than contractual amounts. Any amounts not collected do not represent implicit price concessions and instead are due to general credit risk and therefore, Company treats the allowance for doubtful accounts related to these arrangements as bad debt expense, which is recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. For service fees based on a percentage of collections, the Company receives payment after the hospital and other healthcare provider customers are paid by third-party payers and patients. Revenue is recognized over time as medical services are provided and the measurement of the transaction price is generally consistent with the methodology used with Retail customers (see Retail below). For the majority of its wholesale contracts, the Company has the right to invoice the customer in an amount that directly corresponds with the value to the customer of the Company’s performance to date. The Company uses the practical expedient under ASC 606 to recognize revenue corresponding with amounts it has the right to invoice for services performed. Retail Retail revenues are generated from freestanding facilities managed and operated by the Company, who submit billings and collect fees directly from the patients and third-party payers that are managed by the center. The Company’s performance obligations are to provide outpatient medical services to patients, such as diagnostic services, radiation therapy, pain management treatment, or the provision of goods and services during a patient visit. Revenues are recorded during the period the obligations to provide medical ----- services are satisfied. Performance obligations for medical services are generally satisfied over a period of less than one day. The contractual relationships with patients, in most cases, also involve a third-party payer (Medicare, Medicaid, managed care health plans and commercial insurance companies, including plans offered through the health insurance exchanges) and the transaction prices for the services provided are dependent upon the terms provided by (Medicare and Medicaid) or negotiated with (managed care health plans and commercial insurance companies) the third-party payers. The payment arrangements with third-party payers for the services the Company provides to the related patients typically specify payments at amounts less than standard charges and generally provide for payments based upon predetermined rates per diagnostic services or discounted fee-for-service rates. Uninsured patients are billed based on established patient fee schedule or fees negotiated. Management continually reviews the contractual estimation process to consider and incorporate updates to laws and regulations and the frequent changes in contractual terms resulting from contract renegotiations and renewals. Revenue recorded is based upon the estimated amounts the Company expects to be entitled to receive from patients and thirdparty payers. Estimates of contractual adjustments under managed care and commercial insurance plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements. Revenues related to uninsured patients, uninsured copayment, and deductible amounts for patients who have healthcare coverage may have discounts applied (uninsured discounts and contractual discounts). The Company also records estimated implicit price concessions (based primarily on historical collection experience) related to uninsured accounts to record self-pay revenues at the estimated amounts ultimately expected to be collected. The Company considers all readily available information when preparing its estimates. As part of its adoption of ASC 606, the Company elected the available practical expedient to recognize revenue using the portfolio approach as the Company does not expect the financial statement effects of this approach to materially differ from an individual contract approach. Other For certain contracts, the Company generates revenue from the rental of equipment and accounts for such contracts as operating leases. The revenue for these arrangements is recognized over the term of the related contract based on the use of the asset and at the amounts expected to be collected. In addition, the Company also records revenue from management services that it performs based upon management service contracts with predetermined pricing and records such revenues in the period in which the service is performed and at the amounts expected to be collected. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of consolidated revenues during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Derivatives and Hedging accounting policies. See below for additional details related to the adoption of ASU 2017-12. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2017-12, for derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges, the Company was required to separately measure and reflect the amount by which the hedging instrument did not offset the changes in the cash flows of hedged items, which was referred to as the ineffective amount. The Company assessed hedge effectiveness at each reporting period and recorded the gain or loss related to the ineffective portion of derivative instruments, if any, in interest expense, net, in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Pursuant to the provisions of ASU 2017-12, the Company is no longer required to separately measure and recognize hedge ineffectiveness. Upon adoption of ASU 2017-12, the Company no longer recognizes hedge ineffectiveness in its consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, but instead recognizes the entire change in the fair value of cash flow hedges in other comprehensive loss. The amounts recorded in other comprehensive loss are subsequently reclassified to earnings in the same line item in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as impacted by the hedged item when the hedged item affects earnings. In addition, the Company has elected to assess the effectiveness of its hedging relationships qualitatively in subsequent reporting periods after the initial quantitative assessment as permitted by the new standard. of the ultimate claims based on historical experience, current industry information and actuarial analysis, and evaluates the estimates for claim loss exposure on an annual basis. The Company believes that adequate provision has been made in the consolidated financial statements for these liabilities. The most significant assumptions used in the estimation process include determining the trend in costs, the expected cost of claims incurred but not reported and the expected costs to settle or pay damage awards with respect to unpaid claims. Recorded liabilities are based upon estimates, and while management believes the estimates of loss are reasonable, the ultimate liability may be in excess of or less than the recorded amounts. ineffectiveness amounts as all such amounts were not material. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In October 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-16, “Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Inclusion of the Secured Overnight Financial Rate (SOFR) Overnight Index Swap (OIS) Rate as a Benchmark Interest Rate for Hedge Accounting Purposes,” which expands the list of U.S. benchmark interest rates permitted in the application of hedge accounting to include the Overnight Index Swap (“OIS”) rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”). SOFR is a new index calculated by reference to shortterm repurchase agreements backed by Treasury securities. It was selected as a preferred replacement for U.S. dollar London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), which will be phased out by June of 2023. The amendments in this ASU are required to be adopted concurrently with the amendments in ASU 2017-12. The Company adopted this ASU concurrently with ASU 2017-12 during the year ended December 31, 2020, but will continue to use LIBOR while available. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. balance. The estimated fair value of the identifiable assets acquired at the acquisition date was $6.5 million, including identifiable intangible assets of $5.4 million. The excess purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired was $1.4 million and was recorded in goodwill. The amounts recorded for goodwill and intangible assets are being amortized over 15 years for tax purposes. Acquired intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The fair values of the identifiable intangible assets were estimated using a valuation methodology representing Level 3 fair value measurements. The values assigned to the identifiable intangible assets acquired are preliminary and may be subject to adjustment upon the final determination of their respective fair values. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the post-acquisition results associated with the MIT acquisition include net revenues and income before income taxes of $1.4 million and $0.3 million, respectively. million were recorded in other accrued liabilities in the 2020 consolidated balance sheet pending the achievement of certain requirements. The Relief Funds do not have to be repaid. The CARES Act provided for the deferred payment of the employer portion of Social Security taxes between March 27, 2020 and December 31, 2020, with 50% of the deferred amount due December 31, 2021 and the remaining 50% due December 31, 2022. The Company elected to defer depositing the employer’s share of Social Security taxes beginning in April 2020. As of December 31, 2020, $5.7 million related to these deferred payments are included in accrued compensation and related expenses in the consolidated balance sheet. The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss are as follows: Borrowings under the First Lien Credit Agreement bear interest through maturity at a variable rate based upon, at the Company’s option, either the LIBOR or the base rate (which is the highest of (a) the administrative agent’s prime rate, (b) the rate which is one-half of 1.00% in excess of the New York Federal Reserve Bank Rate (“NYFRB Rate”) (as defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement), or (c) the rate which is 1.00% in excess of the one-month LIBOR rate), plus, in each case, an applicable margin. With respect to the first lien term loan facility, the applicable margin for LIBOR loans is 4.50% per annum, with a LIBOR floor of 1.00%, and with respect to the first lien revolving loan facility, the applicable margin for LIBOR loans ranges from 3.00% to 4.25% per annum, based on the applicable leverage ratio. The applicable margin for base rate loans under the first lien term loan facility is 3.50% per annum and under the first lien revolving loan facility ranges from 2.00% to 3.25% per annum, based on the applicable leverage ratio. The Company is required to pay a commitment fee which ranges from 0.40% to 0.50% per annum, based on the applicable leverage ratio, on the undrawn portion available under the first lien revolving loan facility and variable per annum fees with respect to outstanding letters of credit. Borrowings under the Second Lien Credit Agreement bear interest through maturity at a variable rate based upon, at the Company’s option, either the LIBOR or the base rate (which is the highest of (a) the administrative agent’s prime rate, (b) the rate which is one-half of 1.00% in excess of the Federal Funds Effective Rate (as defined in the Second Lien Credit Agreement), or (c) the rate which is 1.00% in excess of the one-month LIBOR rate), plus, in each case, an applicable margin. With respect to the second lien term loan facility, the applicable margin is 10.00% per annum for LIBOR loans, with a LIBOR floor of 1.00%, and 9.00% for base rate loans. Obligations under the Credit Agreements are guaranteed by substantially all the Company’s direct and indirect domestic and foreign subsidiaries. The obligations under the Credit Agreements and the guarantees are secured by a lien on substantially all tangible and intangible property and by a pledge of all of the shares of stock and limited liability company interests of the Company’s direct and indirect subsidiaries, subject to limited exceptions. In the case of subsidiaries that are either (i) a direct Material Foreign Subsidiary or (ii) a direct CFC Holdco (as defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement), up to but not exceeding 65% of the total shares will be pledged as security. In addition to other covenants, the Credit Agreements place limits on the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to declare dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock, prepay, redeem or purchase debt, incur liens and engage in sale-leaseback transactions, make loans and investments, incur additional indebtedness, amend or otherwise alter debt and other material agreements, engage in mergers, acquisitions and asset sales, transact with affiliates and alter the business conducted by the Company and its subsidiaries. Prior to the amendment discussed below, the Credit Agreements contained financial covenants, including a maximum leverage ratio and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, and other customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. Under the First Lien Credit Agreement, the leverage ratio covenant required the Company to maintain a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the agreement) that ranged from 5.00 to 1.00 to 4.50 to 1.00. Under the Second Lien Credit Agreement, the Consolidated Leverage Ratio covenant ranged from 5.50 to 1.00 to 5.00 to 1.00. Under the First Lien Credit Agreement, the minimum Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement) was 1.50. Failure to comply with the covenants in the Credit Agreements could permit the lenders under the Credit Agreements to declare all amounts borrowed under the Credit Agreements, together with accrued interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable and to terminate all commitments under the Credit Agreements. The Company was in compliance with all such covenants as of December 31, 2019. The outstanding principal balance of the term loans under the First Lien Credit Agreement is subject to repayment in quarterly installments. No amortization payment is required with respect to the first lien revolving loan facility or the second lien term loan facility. The Company is required to make mandatory prepayments of term loans under the Credit Agreements, subject to specified exceptions, from Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the Credit Agreements) and with the proceeds of asset sales, debt issuances and specified other events. and June 30, 2020. On July 10, 2020 and August 10, 2020, the Company obtained waivers for the Specified Defaults and Related Event of Default (as defined in the waivers) that occurred pursuant to the Credit Agreements. The waived covenants included, among others, the Consolidated Leverage Ratio for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020 and the timely delivery of audited financial statements and other information. On October 13, 2020, the Company entered into amendments to the Credit Agreements that provided for, among other things, an amendment to the Consolidated Leverage Ratio and the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio commencing for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2020. In addition, a new monthly financial covenant was established to provide for a Minimum Liquidity (as defined in the amendments). The required Minimum Liquidity is $40 million and $32 million for the First Lien Credit Agreement and the Second Lien Credit Agreement, respectively. Commencing on November 30, 2021, the required Minimum Liquidity is reduced to $32 million and $25 million for the First Lien Credit Agreement and the Second Lien Credit Agreement, respectively. Covenants under the amended First Lien Credit Agreement require the Company to maintain a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio that ranges from 7.00 to 1.00 to 6.00 to 1.00, as well as a minimum Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio that ranges from 1.25 to 1.00 to 1.50 to 1.00. Under the amended Second Lien Credit Agreement, the maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio covenant ranges from 7.50 to 1.00 to 6.50 to 1.00. The Company was in compliance with all such covenants as of December 31, 2020. Principal payments due under the amended first lien term loan are subject to deferral of 40% of the principal payment, under certain conditions, at the option of the Company for payments due through December 31, 2020; thereafter, principal payments are dependent upon the Company’s Liquidity (as defined in the amendment). Borrowings under the amended first lien term loan bear additional interest ranging from 1% to 4% per annum and may be payable-in-kind (subject to certain conditions), and added to the outstanding principal balance at the option of the Company. During 2020, interest payable-in-kind of $0.8 million was added to the principal balance of the first lien term loan. The amended first lien revolving loan facility bears interest at a rate of 0.25% per annum higher than the terms in the original agreement and added a LIBOR floor of 1%. Borrowings under the amended Second Lien Credit Agreement bear additional interest of 1% per annum. Interest aggregating 10% per annum for LIBOR loans and 9% for base rate loans is payable-in-kind (subject to certain conditions) and added to the outstanding principal balance at the option of the Company. During 2020, interest payable-in-kind of $2.1 million was added to the principal balance of the second lien term loan. The amendments to the Credit Agreements provide for a Capital Event (as defined in the amendments), which requires the Company to (i) repay at least $75 million of the outstanding first lien term loan principal balance (from sources specified in the amendment) on or prior to November 15, 2021, or (ii) have achieved a Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 4.50 to 1.00 or less as of any single fiscal quarter ending prior to November 1, 2021. In connection with the amendments, the Company paid a 1% consent fee to the consenting lenders under the Credit Agreements. In connection with the amendments to the Credit Agreements, the Company’s immediate parent company, THAIHOT Investment Company US Limited (“THAIHOT”) issued warrants to purchase shares of THAIHOT common stock for the benefit of the lenders of the first lien term loan facility and the second lien term loan facility. The warrants granted represent 25% of the shares of THAIHOT’s common stock (“Initial Warrant Grant”) at a purchase price per share of $0.01. The warrants may be repurchased by THAIHOT on or prior to a Capital Event (as defined in the amendments to the Credit Agreements) for $25 million. If the repurchase occurs after a Capital Event, the price will be the then-current fair market value as determined by an independent third-party appraisal firm. In the event the Company does not complete a Capital Event by November 15, 2021 (“Triggering Event”), THAIHOT will be required to issue warrants to purchase additional shares of THAIHOT common stock at a price per share of $0.01. The aggregate amount of warrants to be granted from the Initial Warrant Grant and the Triggering Event represents 95% of the shares of THAIHOT’s common stock. All warrants expire seven years from the original issue date. Based on a third-party valuation of the fair value of the warrants, the Company recorded $19.7 million in additional paid-in capital as a contribution from THAIHOT during 2020. The fair value of the warrants was determined with a Monte Carlo Simulation model utilizing the following estimates and key assumptions: ----- Discount rate 10.5% Common equity value $144 million Expected daily return 0.02% EBITDA multiple 7.1x Volatility 2.6% As a result of the amendment, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a $14.6 million loss on extinguishment or modification of debt, based on an analysis of the underlying lender parties. The Company incurred fees totaling $39.7 million (including $19.7 million fair value of the warrants), of which $27.1 million were capitalized and are being amortized using the effective interest method as interest expense over the term of the Credit Agreements. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $39.5 million of available borrowings under its revolving loan facility, net of $80.0 million outstanding on the revolving loan facility and $5.5 million outstanding in letters of credit. The following table presents the effect of cash flow hedge accounting on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss: The following table summarizes the Company’s SARs activity: As of December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $27.9 million (an increase of $16.5 million in 2020) against its deferred tax assets, principally related to its net operating losses. Based on the Company's earnings history and available objectively verifiable positive and negative evidence, the Company determined that it is more likely than not that a portion of its deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has provided a liability of $0.1 million for unrecognized tax benefits related to various federal and state income tax matters. The tax-effected amount that would reduce the Company's effective income tax rate if recognized is $0.1 million.

The Company established five single-year interest rate swap agreements (""JPM Interest Rate Swaps"") with JPM, the administrative agent of the First Lien Credit Agreement. The JPM Interest Rate Swaps, which mature on June 30, 2019, June 30, 2020, June 30, 2021, June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, respectively, have notional amounts of $300.0 million each and were designated as cash flow hedges of future cash interest payments associated with a portion of the Company’s variable rate debt included in the Credit Agreements (see Note 7). Under the terms of these swap agreements, the Company receives one-month LIBOR and pays fixed rates ranging from 2.483% to 3.167% on the notional amounts. The net effect of the hedges is to record interest expense at these fixed rates plus the applicable margin of the underlying debt. At December 31, 2020, the Company had interest rate swap agreements to hedge $307.9 million of its variable-rate bank debt or approximately 54% of total variable-rate debt. At December 31, 2019, the Company had interest rate swap agreements to hedge $309.3 million of its variable-rate bank debt or approximately 55% of total variable-rate debt.

SARs have 10-year terms and vest in three equal installments on each of the three anniversaries following the vesting commencement date. SARs are granted with a base price of not less than 100% of the fair value of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant. Once vested, SARs can be exercised to acquire shares of the Company’s common stock during the specified annual exercise period. The number of shares to be issued upon exercise of the SARs is based on the aggregate appreciation of the SARs value, calculated as the difference between the fair market value of the Company’s common stock as of the specified valuation date preceding the exercise date and the SARs base price. SARs are subject to accelerated vesting provisions upon certain change in control and other specified events. Upon termination of employment or service, unvested awards are generally cancelled and vested awards may be exercised for a limited period of time. Under the plan, up to 750,000 SARs may be granted and SARs that are exercised, forfeited or canceled or otherwise not paid will not again be available for grant under the plan. |Year Ended December 31,|Year Ended December 31,| |---|---| |Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019|Year Ended December 31,| |Interest Interest (in thousands) Expense, net Expense, net|| |Total amounts of income and expense line items presented in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss in which the effects of cash flow hedges are recorded $ 56,481 $ 56,187|| ||| |The effects of fair value and cash flow hedging|| |Loss on cash flow hedging relationships:|| |Interest rate contracts:|| |Amount of loss reclassified from Accumulated OCI into Income|$ 5,812 $ 1,389| -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,388
