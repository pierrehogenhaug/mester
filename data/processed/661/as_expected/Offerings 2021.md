###### $500,000,000


## AKUMIN ESCROW INC.

###### whose obligations are to be assumed by


## AKUMIN INC.

#####      % Senior Secured Notes due 2028

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________


Akumin Escrow Inc. (the “Escrow Issuer”), a newly-formed corporation that is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Akumin Inc., is
offering $500,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of    % senior secured notes due 2028 (the “Notes”). The Notes will
bear interest at a rate of      % per annum. Interest will be payable on the Notes semi-annually in cash in arrears on
and       of each year, beginning on      , 2021. The Notes will mature on      , 2028.
We intend to use net proceeds of this offering, as well as the proceeds from the Initial Financing Notes (as defined below),
the Financing Common Shares (as defined below) and cash on hand to fund the cash portion of the purchase price for the
proposed acquisition (the “Acquisition”) by Akumin Corp. of Alliance HealthCare Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries
(“Alliance”). See “Use of Proceeds.”
This offering may be consummated prior to the consummation of the Acquisition. If this offering closes prior to the
consummation of the Acquisition, the Escrow Issuer will deposit, concurrently with the closing of this offering, the gross
proceeds from the sale of the Notes offered hereby into an escrow account plus an amount sufficient to pay interest with
respect to the Notes up to, but not including, the then-applicable latest possible Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as
defined below). The release of the escrow proceeds will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the
consummation of the Acquisition (the “Escrow Release Conditions”). If the Acquisition is not consummated by October 25,
2021 (as such date may be extended as described under “Description of Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory
Redemption,” but no later than January 24, 2022, the ‘‘Outside Date’’), or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the
Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption. The special mandatory redemption price will be a price equal to
100% of the initial issue price of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, from the date of initial issuance of the
Notes (the ‘‘Issue Date’’) up to, but not including, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (the “Special Mandatory
Redemption Price”). If this offering is consummated prior to the Acquisition, upon the consummation of the Acquisition, the
Escrow Issuer will liquidate into Akumin Inc. and, on the liquidation, Akumin Inc. will assume the obligations of Escrow Issuer
under the Indenture and the Notes (the “Assumption”). If the closing of the Acquisition (the “Closing”) has occurred at or
prior to the time of the consummation of the offering of Notes, we will forego the escrow procedures described in this offering
memorandum. See ‘‘Description of Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.’’
The Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, on or after     , 2024 at the redemption prices specified under
“Description of Notes—Optional Redemption,” together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but not including,
the redemption date. At any time prior to       , 2024, the Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at a redemption
price equal to 100% of their principal amount plus a make-whole premium, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
thereon to, but not including, the redemption date. Up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes may be
redeemed at any time prior to        , 2024 with an amount not to exceed the net cash proceeds from certain equity
offerings at the redemption prices set forth in this offering memorandum plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon
to, but not including, the redemption date. See “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption.” If we sell certain of our assets
or experience specific kinds of changes of control, Akumin Inc. must offer to purchase the Notes at the prices set forth in
this offering memorandum plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but not including, the date of purchase.
If the gross proceeds of the Notes are funded into the escrow account, prior to the satisfaction of the Escrow Release
Conditions, the Notes will not be guaranteed, but will be secured by an exclusive first-priority lien granted by the Escrow
Issuer on the funds held in the escrow account.
If the gross proceeds of the Notes are not funded into the escrow account or, after the satisfaction of the Escrow Release
Conditions, the obligations under the Notes will be guaranteed (the “guarantees”), jointly and severally, by each of Akumin


-----

Credit Facility (as defined below), which, following the consummation of the Acquisition will include Alliance and certain of
its subsidiaries.
Prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, the Notes will be secured by a first-priority security interest in the funds held
in the escrow account at any given time. If the gross proceeds of the Notes are not funded into the escrow account or after
the satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions, the Notes and the guarantees will be secured on a first-priority basis by
liens on substantially all of Akumin Inc.’s and the guarantors’ tangible and intangible assets (the “Collateral”), subject to
certain exceptions and permitted liens, which, following the consummation of the Acquisition will include the assets of
Alliance and certain of its subsidiaries. The liens on the Collateral will be equal and ratable, pursuant to the terms of the first
lien intercreditor agreement, with the indebtedness under our Revolving Credit Facility and the 2025 Senior Notes. See
“Description of Notes—Security”.
If the gross proceeds of the Notes are not funded into the escrow account or after the satisfaction of the Escrow Release
Conditions, the Notes and the related guarantees will be Akumin Inc.’s and the guarantors’ senior secured obligations and
will rank equally in right of payment with the existing 2025 Senior Notes (as defined herein) and our Revolving Credit Facility
and any existing and future senior indebtedness, senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness, and
rank equally to any existing and future secured indebtedness of Akumin Inc. and the guarantors secured by the Collateral
on a first lien basis, including our Revolving Credit Facility and the existing 2025 Senior Notes, to the extent of the value of
the assets securing such indebtedness. The Notes and the related guarantees are effectively subordinated to any existing
and future indebtedness that is secured by liens on assets that do not constitute a part of the Collateral to the extent of the
value of such assets. In addition, the Notes and the guarantees are structurally subordinated to any existing and future
indebtedness, claims of holders of preferred stock and other liabilities of any subsidiary of Akumin Inc. that is not a guarantor
of the Notes.
**_Investing in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 30._**

###### Offering Price of the Notes:     %.

The Notes and the guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
“Securities Act”), or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. The Notes are being offered and sold only to persons
reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act (“Rule 144A”) and
to certain non-U.S. persons in transactions outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act
(“Regulation S”). Prospective purchasers that are qualified institutional buyers are hereby notified that the sellers of the
Notes may be relying on the exemption from Section 5 of the Securities Act pursuant to Rule 144A. For a description of
certain information about eligible offerees and restrictions on transfers of the Notes, see “Transfer Restrictions” and “Plan
of Distribution.”
Currently, there is no public market for the Notes. We do not intend to apply for listing of the Notes on any securities
exchange or for inclusion of the Notes in any automated dealer quotation system.
The Notes and the guarantees will not be entitled to any registration rights and we will not be required to complete a
registered exchange offer or shelf registration of the Notes and the guarantees.
The initial purchasers expect to deliver the Notes to investors only in book-entry form through the facilities of The Depository
Trust Company (“DTC”) for the benefit of its participants, including Euroclear Bank, S.A./N.V. and Clearstream Banking,
société anonyme, on or about    , 2021. See “Book Entry, Delivery and Form.”

information that you need from us;

    - you have not relied upon the initial purchasers or any person affiliated with the initial purchasers in
connection with your investigation of the accuracy of such information or your investment decision;

    - this offering memorandum relates to an offering that is exempt from registration and prospectus
qualification under the Securities Act and applicable Canadian securities laws and does not comply in

applicable Canadian securities laws that would apply to an offering document relating to a public
offering of securities; and

    - no person has been authorized to give information or to make any representation concerning us, this

examination of us and the terms of this offering.

The Notes and the note guarantees have not been and will not be registered with, recommended by, or approved or
disapproved by any securities commission or regulatory authority, nor has any securities commission or regulatory
authority passed upon or endorsed the merits of the offering or the accuracy or adequacy of this offering
memorandum. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

The distribution of this offering memorandum and the offering and sale of the Notes in certain jurisdictions may be
restricted by law. The Issuer, the guarantors and the initial purchasers require persons into whose possession this
offering memorandum comes to inform themselves about and to observe any such restrictions. This offering
memorandum does not constitute an offer of, or an invitation to purchase, any of the Notes in any jurisdiction in
which such offer or invitation would be unlawful. For a description of the restrictions on offers, sales and resales of
the Notes and distribution of this offering memorandum, see “Plan of Distribution” and “Transfer Restrictions”.

any offeree or purchaser under any applicable law.

laws and any other applicable securities laws pursuant to registration, prospectus qualification or exemptions
therefrom. As a prospective purchaser, you should be aware that you may be required to bear the financial risks of
this investment for an indefinite period of time.

In making an investment decision, prospective investors must rely on their own examination of Akumin and the
terms of the offering, including the merits and risks involved. Prospective investors should not construe anything in
the offering memorandum as legal, business or tax advice. Each prospective investor should consult its own advisors
in making its investment decision and to confirm there are no legal, regulatory or contractual restrictions prohibiting


-----

its investment and whether it is legally permitted to purchase the securities under applicable investment or similar
laws or regulations.

This offering memorandum is being provided on a confidential basis for informational use solely in connection with
consideration of a purchase of the Notes (i) to persons reasonably believed to be “qualified institutional buyers” as
defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act, (ii) to other investors in offshore transactions complying with Rule
903 or Rule 904 of Regulation S under the Securities Act, and (iii) in the case of sales into Canada, to purchasers
acquiring the Notes pursuant to a prospectus exemption. Its use for any other purpose is not authorized.

Act and in Canada pursuant to exemptions from the prospectus requirements of applicable Canadian securities laws
for an offer and sale of the Notes that do not involve a public offering. Prospective purchasers are hereby notified
that sellers of the Notes may be relying upon the exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act
provided by Rule 144A thereunder. In making your purchase, you will be deemed to have made certain
acknowledgments, representations and agreements as set forth under “Transfer Restrictions”.

reserve the right to reject any offer to purchase the Notes in whole or in part for any reason or no reason and to allot
to any prospective purchaser less than the full amount of the Notes subscribed for by it. The initial purchasers and
certain of their related entities may acquire, for their own accounts, a portion of the Notes.

The initial purchasers make no representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of
the information contained in this offering memorandum. Nothing contained in this offering memorandum is, or shall
be relied upon as, a promise or representation by the initial purchasers as to the past or future. The initial purchasers
assume no responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any such information.

**ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

Akumin is organized under and governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario, and the federal laws of Canada
applicable therein. Some of the directors and officers of the Issuer and the guarantors and certain of the experts
named in this offering memorandum reside outside the United States, and certain assets of such persons are located
outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process for a lawsuit
within the United States upon such persons, including with respect to matters arising under the Securities Act, or to
enforce against any of them, judgments in non-U.S. courts obtained in courts of the United States predicated upon,
among other things, the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws.

Each of the Escrow Issuer, the issuer and each Guarantor has appointed Legalinc, New York, New York, as its agent
for service of process in the U.S. in respect of any civil suit or action brought against or involving it in a U.S. federal
or state court located in the Borough of Manhattan of the City of New York arising out of, related to or concerning
the offering of the Notes.

appropriations; (vi) changes in our revenues due to declining patient procedure volumes, changes in

medical imaging centers;

    - our ability to enforce any claims relating to breaches of indemnities or representations and warranties
in connection with any acquisitions;

economic conditions in geographic areas where we operate.

Various assumptions or factors are typically applied in drawing conclusions or making the forecasts or projections
set out in forward-looking information. Those assumptions and factors are based on information currently available

instances, material assumptions and factors are presented or discussed elsewhere in this offering memorandum in
connection with the statements or disclosure containing the forward-looking information. The reader is cautioned
that the following list of material factors and assumptions is not exhaustive. The factors and assumptions include,
but are not limited to:

    - no unforeseen changes in the legislative and operating framework for our business;

    - no unforeseen changes in the prices for our services in markets where prices are regulated;

    - no unforeseen changes in the regulatory environment for our services;

    - a stable competitive environment;

    - no significant event occurring outside the ordinary course of business such as a natural disaster,
pandemic or other calamity; and

    - the successful consummation and integration of the Acquisition.

Although we have attempted to identify important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from
our plans, strategies, expectations and objectives there may be other factors that could cause our results to differ
from what we currently anticipate, estimate or intend. Forward-looking statements are provided to assist external
stakeholders in understanding management’s expectations and plans relating to the future as of the date of the
original document and may not be appropriate for other purposes. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance
on forward-looking statements. All such statements are made as of the date of this offering memorandum and we
undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information,
future events or otherwise.

We qualify all the forward-looking statements contained in this offering memorandum by the foregoing cautionary
statements.

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION - AKUMIN**

Akumin’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). We adopted GAAP as the basis of preparation for the 2020 Annual
Financial Statements effective for the fiscal year-ended December 31, 2020. Previously, our financial statements
were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the
International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”), for the period up to and including the 9-months ended
September 30, 2020.

The results of operations (including, without limitation, statements of income) of ADG Acquisition Holdings, Inc.,
TIC Acquisition Holdings, LLC and SFL Radiology Holdings, LLC, the businesses acquired in connection with the
ADG Acquisitions (as defined herein) are included in our consolidated statements of income (loss) and
comprehensive income (loss) from June 1, 2019 (the date following the date of acquisition) and not for any prior
period. Balance sheet data as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 include the businesses acquired in
connection with the ADG Acquisitions. For additional information on the ADG Acquisitions, see Note 3 to our
audited financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION - ALLIANCE**

The consolidated financial statements of Alliance HealthCare Services, Inc. have been prepared in accordance with
GAAP.

**NON-GAAP MEASURES - AKUMIN**

This offering memorandum makes reference to certain non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are not
recognized measures under GAAP and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are therefore
unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Rather, these non-GAAP measures are
provided as additional information to complement those GAAP measures by providing further understanding of our
results of operations from management’s perspective. Accordingly, these non-GAAP measures should not be
considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of our financial information reported under GAAP. We use
non-GAAP financial measures, including “EBITDA”, “Adjusted EBITDA”, “Adjusted EBITDA Normalized for
COVID-19” and “Adjusted EBITDA Margin”. These non-GAAP measures are used to provide investors with
supplemental measures of our operating performance and thus highlight trends in our core business that may not
otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP measures. We believe the use of these non-GAAP measures,
along with GAAP financial measures, enhances the understanding of our operating results and is useful to us and to
investors in comparing performance with competitors, estimating enterprise value and making investment decisions.
We also believe that securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use non-GAAP measures in
the evaluation of issuers. Our management also uses non-GAAP measures in order to facilitate operating
performance comparisons from period to period, to prepare annual operating budgets and forecasts and to determine
components of management compensation. Such measures do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by
GAAP and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies, including
Alliance.

We define such non-GAAP measures as follows:

“EBITDA” means net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Akumin before interest expense (net), income
tax expense (recovery) and depreciation and amortization.

“Adjusted EBITDA” means EBITDA as further adjusted for stock-based compensation, impairment of property
and equipment, provisions for certain credit losses, settlement costs, provisions, acquisition-related and public
offering costs, gains (losses) in the period and, one-time adjustments.

“Adjusted EBITDA Margin” means Adjusted EBITDA divided by the revenue in the period.

“Free Cash Flow” means Adjusted EBITDA less cash interest paid and cash capital expenditures.


-----

“Adjusted EBITDA Normalized for COVID-19 for Akumin” means Adjusted EBITDA for the LTM period
ended March 31, 2021 plus a “COVID-19 Adjustment” of approximately $9 million with respect to Akumin. This
amount of this adjustment was estimated by multiplying the incremental RVU volume (as calculated in the last
sentence of this definition) of approximately 0.428 million RVUs by: (i) the service fee net revenue per RVU of
$42.57 for the LTM period ended March 31, 2021, and (ii) a minimum incremental contribution margin estimated to
be approximately 49%. That minimum incremental contribution margin assumes that operating costs for employee
compensation, reading fees, medical supplies and other expenses, which together represented 51% of net revenue for
the LTM period ended June 30, 2020, are 100% variable and therefore we believe any incremental $1.00 of revenue
equates to $0.49 of incremental EBITDA. The incremental RVU volume was determined by annualizing the RVU
volume for the three-month period ended March 31, 2021 of approximately 1.515 million RVUs less the actual RVU
volume for the LTM period ended March 31, 2021 of approximately 5.632 million RVUs. Adjusted EBITDA
Normalized for COVID-19 is a non-GAAP financial measure and has been calculated assuming that our RVU
volume of 1.515 million RVUs for the three-month period ended March 31, 2021 applied to each quarter in the four
quarter period ended March 31, 2021. There can be no assurance that the RVU volume for the three month period
ended March 31, 2021 would have been indicative of the RVU volume for any quarter included in the LTM period
ended March 31, 2021 had the COVID-19 pandemic not affected our business and the economy generally.

See “Summary – Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information and Other Data” and “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – How We Assess the Performance of our
Business” for a reconciliation of the foregoing non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable measures
calculated in accordance with GAAP.

**NON-GAAP INFORMATION - ALLIANCE**

Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP. Alliance believes, in addition to GAAP
metrics, this non-GAAP metric is a useful measure for investors for a variety of reasons. Alliance’s management
regularly communicates Adjusted EBITDA and their interpretation of such results to its Board. Alliance also
compares actual periodic Adjusted EBITDA against internal targets as a key factor in determining cash incentive
compensation for executives and other employees, largely because it views Adjusted EBITDA results as indicative
of how its Radiology and Oncology businesses are performing and being managed.

Alliance defines Adjusted EBITDA as net loss attributable to Alliance HealthCare Services, Inc. before: income
taxes; net income attributable to non-controlling interest; interest expense, net; depreciation expense; amortization
expense; transaction costs; restructuring charges; impairment charges; severance and related costs; loss on
extinguishment or modification of debt; legal matters and other expenses; share based compensation; and other
charges (benefits), net. Such measures do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are therefore
unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies, including Akumin. Such measures do
not purport to represent results of Alliance following the Acquisition of Alliance by Akumin Corp. and may contain
adjustments that are different from those that Akumin uses in preparing similar measure.

**“Adjusted EBITDA Normalized for COVID-19 for Alliance” is Adjusted EBITDA for the LTM period ended**
March 31, 2021 plus a “COVID-19 Adjustment” of approximately $18 million. This amount of this adjustment was
estimated by determining the estimated decrease in scan volumes for MRIs and PET/CT by subtracting the average
scan volumes for the twelve months-ended March 31, 2021 from the average scan volumes for the year ended
December 31, 2019 and multiplying the average decrease determined by such calculation for each of MRI and
PET/CT by the actual revenues per scan for the year ended December 31, 2019 for each of MRI and PET/CT, which
resulted in an estimated decrease in revenues of $59 million. The corresponding Adjusted EBITDA amount was
determined by multiplying $59 million by the operating margin of 38% for the year ended December 31, 2019 and
subtracting approximately $4 million of costs associated with one-time furloughed employee costs. There can be no
assurance that average scan volume for the year ended December 31, 2019 would have been indicative of the
average scan volumes for any quarter included in the LTM period ended March 31, 2021 had the COVID-19
pandemic not affected our business and the economy generally.

The presentation of a non-GAAP metric does not imply that the reconciling items presented are non-recurring,
infrequent or unusual. In general, non-GAAP metrics have certain limitations as analytical financial measures and
are used in conjunction with GAAP results to evaluate operating performance and by considering independently the
economic effects of the items that are or are not reflected in non-GAAP metrics. Alliance compensates for such


-----

limitations by providing GAAP based disclosures concerning the excluded items in its financial disclosures. As a
result of these limitations, and because non-GAAP metrics may not be directly comparable to similarly titled
measures reported by other companies, the non-GAAP metrics are not an alternative to the most directly comparable
GAAP measure or any other GAAP measure of operating performance.

**Business Overview**

**Akumin Business Overview**

Akumin is a leading provider of outpatient diagnostic imaging services in the United States, with 137 owned or
operated freestanding, fixed-site outpatient diagnostic imaging centers. Our centers provide physicians with imaging
capabilities to facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of diseases and disorders in order to help reduce unnecessary
invasive procedures, determine the appropriate amount of care and minimize cost for patients. Our services include
magnetic resonance imaging (“MRI”), computed tomography (“CT”), positron emission tomography (“PET”),
ultrasound, X-ray and mammography as well as other diagnostic and interventional radiology procedures.

We seek to develop leading positions in regional markets in order to leverage operational efficiencies. Our 137
centers are located in eight states, including: Florida (79), Texas (23), Pennsylvania (14), Delaware (8), Georgia (6),
Illinois (3), Kansas (1), and Massachusetts (3). Our scale and density within selected geographies in the United
States drives long-term relationships with key payors, radiology groups, and referring physicians. Our operations
team is dedicated to meeting high standards of patient care, managing relationships with local patients, physicians
and payors, and improving profitability. We provide corporate training programs, standardize policies and
procedures, and share best practices among the physicians in our regional networks so that they can be implemented.

Our scalable and integrated operating platform supports our ability to drive organic growth, realize cost efficiencies,
and create value from integrating acquisitions. Strategic acquisitions and organic growth have helped us strengthen
our position in core geographies. Since our inception, we have successfully integrated more than 100 outpatient
diagnostic imaging centers into our platform. We believe our scale and track record of being able to achieve material
cost synergies enable us to successfully compete for acquisitions.

On June 25, 2021, we entered into an agreement to acquire Thaihot Investment Company US Limited, which owns
100% of the common stock of Alliance, from Thaihot Investment Co., LTD, for $820 million.

**Alliance Business Overview**

Alliance is a leading national provider of outsourced advanced radiology and radiation therapy services across 45
states in the United States Alliance partners with more than 1,000 hospitals, health systems, and physician practices
to provide a full continuum of solutions, including onsite outpatient services and comprehensive service line
management. Alliance delivers exceptional customer and patient care via more than 500 diagnostic radiology and
radiation therapy systems.

Alliance’s diagnostic imaging services are delivered through its Radiology Division. Alliance provides radiology
services through its hospital, health system and physician practice relationships, as well as through 19 independent,
freestanding outpatient imaging centers. We believe that Alliance’s Radiology Division is one of the nation’s
leading providers of MRI and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (“PET/CT”), with 67% and
18% of the division’s volume coming from MRI and PET/CT, respectively, for fiscal year 2020. Alliance provides
full-service, multi-modality radiology department and center management, including certified clinical staffing, day

-----

to-day operations, sales and marketing, patient scheduling and pre-authorization, revenue cycle management, payor
relations, systems, equipment maintenance and upgrades. Alliance generally enters into long-term contracts or
partnerships with its health system, hospital and physician group partners.

Through its Oncology Division, Alliance operates 34 radiation oncology centers across 20 states. Alliance provides
a wide range of radiation therapy services and ancillary services for cancer patients, including: planning and
preparation for treatment, simulation of treatment, delivery of radiation therapy, therapy management, and follow-up
care. Alliance offers various treatment options, including conventional, intensity-modulated and stereotactic body
radiation therapies and stereotactic radiosurgery using linear accelerator (“Linac”) and targeted robotic linear
accelerators (“SRS”). Alliance partners directly with hospitals, physicians, and other healthcare providers to offer a
full suite of services in cancer care including access to the latest radiation oncology technologies, full management
of its partners’ cancer care programs including clinical staffing, access to its national network of physicists for
training and development on new treatment protocols and technologies, market analysis, equipment and capital, preauthorization and billing, marketing and sales, and operational management.

**Overview of Combined Company**

We believe that the combined company will offer the most comprehensive radiology and oncology solutions to
patients in the United States, with more than 1,000 hospital and health system customers, 156 independent outpatient
radiology centers and 34 radiation therapy centers. The combined company will operate in 46 states and will have
more than 4,000 team members expected to serve more than 2 million radiology and oncology patient visits
annually.


**Combined Company Geographic Footprint**


The combined company will be significantly diversified across business lines, geographies, modality offerings, and
reimbursement sources. The enhanced diversity of the combined company’s business provides a number of
advantages, including having no material revenue concentration with any health system or hospital customer and no
material concentration with any commercial payor. We expect to generate approximately 52% of our revenue
through services provided for health systems and hospitals which are typically under multi-year contracts with either
fixed fee or per procedure arrangements. The remaining 48% of our revenue is expected to be billed directly to
payors, including commercial payors, Medicare, Medicaid, and other payors. Although 52% of our combined
revenue is expected to come directly from hospitals or health systems, the combined company will be an outpatient
focused service platform as we expect that substantially all revenues are to be generated from outpatient visits. This
focus aligns with the overall shift in the industry to outpatient care.

Below is our payor mix on a combined basis for the year-ended December 31, 2020 and offering and reimbursement
mix on a combined basis for the twelve months ended March 31, 2021.


-----

**Combined Company Geographic Footprint**


For the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, after giving pro forma effect to the Acquisition, we would have
generated revenue of $730 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $213 million, including $24 million in estimated
synergies. See “Summary Pro Forma and Historical Consolidated Financial Information and Other Data –
_Akumin” and “Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information.”_

_Acquisition Strategic Rationale_

Akumin’s rationale for the Acquisition is based on the following benefits Akumin expects to result from the
combination with Alliance:

  - _Creates the national partner of choice for health systems and hospitals with comprehensive solutions_
_addressing all of their outpatient radiology and oncology needs. We believe that the combined company_
will have one of the country’s most comprehensive offerings of MRI procedure, PET/CT procedure, and
radiation therapy services. The combination enhances our ability to provide a full suite of outpatient
services (and expertise in a variety of site and care environments) to hospital and health system customers
across the U.S.

  - _Leverage complementary skills and expertise of each organization. The combined company will apply its_
respective expertise to enhance patient experience and outcomes, while advancing industry trends towards
outpatient, price-transparent, value-based care. The combination brings together both organizations’
expertise in delivering outpatient care, along with Alliance’s expertise in forming partnerships with health
systems and hospitals and Akumin’s freestanding operational expertise.

  - _Expands our presence in the attractive oncology market: Alliance is a leading provider of oncology_
services, which is complementary to and dependent upon diagnostic radiology services. Oncology patients
often require advanced imaging for effective screening diagnosis, staging, treatment and management of
recurrence. We expect the outpatient oncology services that the combined company will be able to offer
will complement the radiology services offering. Together, we believe these radiology and oncology
services will provide an attractive suite of services that address key outpatient needs of hospital and health
systems. In addition, our patients will have available to them a wide array of cancer care needs inclusive of
both advanced diagnostic imaging and radiation therapy modalities, as well as emerging and
complementary new technologies.

**Industry Overview**

_Radiology Overview_

Radiology represents an essential capability of a hospital or health system, driving and influencing many
downstream care processes across multiple medical service lines. Radiology services are utilized across virtually all
disease categories in early, rapid and accurate detection, diagnosis, treatment planning and monitoring, and directly
impact high focus areas such as patient safety, patient experience, length of hospital stay and downstream healthcare
resource utilization. Radiology services also play a critical role in providing quality and efficient healthcare, as
nearly every individual in the United States will require some form of diagnostic imaging and resulting radiology
interpretation for a significant clinical indication during his or her lifetime.

As a result of this widespread adoption, healthcare systems across the world and their affiliated physicians rely on
efficient and effective radiology operations as well as concise and timely radiologist interpretations to make a fully
informed care decisions and to keep their hospital and outpatient operations running smoothly and efficiently.

In diagnostic radiology, the typical patient journey includes (i) a referral from a physician, who orders an exam to
assist with diagnosing or treating a condition, (ii) the procurement of the diagnostic image, usually carried out by a
technologist specialized in the particular procedure or modality, and (iii) an interpretation from a radiologist who
reads and interprets the images and produces a report of their findings and recommendations, which is provided
back to the referring physician for use in the next step of the patient’s care. The referring physician often consults
with the radiologist to choose the appropriate modality, which could include advanced imaging techniques such as
MRI, CT, and PET, or routine imaging techniques such as X-Ray, mammography, ultrasound, fluoroscopy, or
nuclear medicine.

Medical imaging technologies continue to evolve and play a critical role in cost-effective patient diagnosis and
treatment. While X-rays are the most common imaging procedure, more sophisticated and higher reimbursement
procedures, such as MRI, CT and PET scans are the fastest growing.

Radiology exams can be performed at a hospital’s main radiology department or in an outpatient setting, including a
hospital outpatient departments, physician offices or independent diagnostic testing facilities. Outpatient diagnostic
imaging centers are primarily used to provide medical imaging services to patients who are ambulatory (meaning,
they are not in the ER or inpatient) and who have been referred by a third-party physician. Standard offerings
include screening and diagnostic imaging procedures such as X-ray, mammography and ultrasound along with more
complex and costly services, such as MRI, CT and PET, in addition to other diagnostic and interventional radiology
procedures.

Outpatient diagnostic imaging is generally more cost effective compared to imaging performed in the traditional inpatient or on-campus hospital setting. We believe that this dynamic, combined with the convenience of outpatient
care for patients, will result in outpatient imaging growth outpacing the overall radiology market. The gap in pricing
between traditional hospital in-patient facilities and freestanding outpatient facilities has been a significant area of
focus for government and third-party payors, who in an effort to curtail costs, have adopted over time a number of
policies to drive price transparent, site-neutral reimbursements for advanced outpatient imaging procedures, and
steerage to lower-cost, outpatient entities. Payors have also increased requirements for pre-authorization of advanced
diagnostic procedures in an effort to ensure the medical necessity of those procedures. We anticipate that these
trends will continue to drive procedure volume toward outpatient settings —both freestanding and hospital—
outpatient. We believe these trends will drive a need for hospitals and health systems to engage service providers
such as the combined company to provide services and support to build their outpatient radiology capabilities.

The size of the freestanding outpatient diagnostic imaging market in the United States is estimated at more than $19
billion in annual industry revenue. The diagnostic imaging market is highly competitive, consisting of owneroperator radiologists, freestanding outpatient diagnostic imaging centers, and hospitals. We also face competition
from other diagnostic imaging companies in acquiring diagnostic imaging centers. There are estimated to be more
than 6,000 freestanding outpatient diagnostic imaging centers in the United States. The landscape in the outpatient


-----

diagnostic imaging industry is highly fragmented. Other significant radiology businesses in the United States include
RadNet, US Radiology Specialists, SimonMed, RAYUS and MedQuest.

We believe the outpatient diagnostic imaging industry will remain stable for the foreseeable future. Contributing to
this outlook is the expectation of stable Medicare reimbursement rates. After a downward trend in reimbursement
from 2007 to 2014, Medicare reimbursements have generally stabilized. From 2015 to 2020, there has been limited
fluctuation in Medicare reimbursements.


**Medicare Fee Schedule Trends (Top 5 MRI CPT Codes, 2000-2020)**


In addition to a stable Medicare reimbursement outlook, which we believe is often used as a benchmark in the
industry, we also believe the industry will see increasing imaging volumes. Since becoming a mainstream medical
diagnostic mechanism in the 1990’s, utilization of diagnostic imaging has drastically increased. Over the last few
decades, the imaging industry has developed significantly through improvements in technology, the development of
various outpatient imaging sites of service, and the continued increase in the number of patients seeking out imaging
procedures for both screening and diagnosis. Large outpatient imaging center operators, such as Akumin, are in a
position to benefit from these industry dynamics. Scale, reputation and operating excellence will likely be key
drivers of performance for the various industry players.

There are a number of factors that we believe will drive the growth of the radiology industry, including:

  - _Aging demographics: The number of people over the age of 65 in the United States is expected to increase_
significantly, largely owing to the subset of aging baby boomers. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the
“65+” population will outnumber individuals under the age of 18 by 2034. As the overall U.S. population
continues to age, the need for affordable and easily accessible healthcare procedures will expand
proportionally. According to the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) in 2014,
senior citizens, defined as those who are 65 years old or older, made up only 13% of the total U.S.
population, yet accounted for 34% of healthcare-related spending. The vast growth in the elderly
population is expected to positively impact the financial landscape of the overall healthcare industry.

  - _Greater Consumer Awareness for Earlier Intervention and Preventative Screening: Greater consumer_
awareness for early intervention and increased emphasis on preventive screening have changed the
perception of imaging from a luxury service to an essential part of the diagnostic process. Commercial


-----

payors are encouraging the appropriate use of diagnostic imaging and of preventative screenings to help
decrease overall costs by reducing more expensive procedures over the long-run.

  - _Technological Advances Leading to More Use Cases for Radiology: We believe that further technological_
advancements will allow for even earlier diagnosis of diseases and disorders through less invasive methods,
further driving demand for diagnostic imaging services. Additionally, the industry is seeing a shift towards
the adoption of innovative technology in areas such as Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) which has the potential
to transform diagnostic imaging and help with early diagnosis.

_Oncology Overview_

Radiation therapy is the practice of delivering ionizing radiation to treat malignant and benign disease processes
under the direction of a radiation oncologist. Radiation therapy is primarily used to treat cancer patients, as it kills
cancer cells and shrink tumors via the highest possible dose of radiation, in order to destroy the cancerous cells
while minimizing exposure to healthy surrounding tissue.

Alliance specializes in the deployment and utilization of two primary radiation therapy modalities: Linac and
targeted, robotic linear accelerators (“SRS”). Both are utilized to treat the most common and some of the most
deadly cancers in the U.S., including breast, lung, prostate, colon, melanoma and brain cancer. Linac can perform
different types of treatments, including conventional, intensity-modulated and stereotactic body radiation therapies
via treatments that are often lower doses over more sessions and weeks. Some Linacs can provide stereotactic
radiosurgery as well. SRS is specifically designed to treat tumors using stereotactic radiosurgery, which delivers
higher doses and shorter course treatments given over several days.

Demand for cancer care is large and growing. Radiation therapy services are essential to cancer care, with
approximately 66% of cancer patients receiving radiation therapy as a part of their cancer care. As a result, the
radiation therapy market is significant, with an estimated size of $3 billion and annual growth estimated in the midsingle-digits. There are more than 2,300 radiation therapy centers across the country.

Radiation therapy treatment relies on the execution of technical services coordinated with professional physician and
clinician services. There are a number of highly trained professionals involved in the workflow. Care is led by the
radiation oncologist, a specially trained physician who works with other physicians and the full radiation therapy
staff to oversee each patient’s treatment and coordinates the most appropriate radiation therapy approach for each
patient. The medical physicist assures the accurate delivery of all aspects of treatment, oversees dosimetrists, and
ensures that treatments are properly planned specifically for each patient. The dosimetrist designs the treatment plan
(including dose distributions and calculations) for a prescribed course of therapy. This includes all specific dose
calculations for each patient. The radiation therapist administers radiation therapy to patients via the specified
equipment and monitors the patient during treatment. The radiation oncology nurse works with the patient and care
team to provide support, care and resources before, during and after treatment. The center staff are team members
who support clinical care and operations, which can include front desk staff, site administrators, navigators and
others.

There are a number of different Medicare payment methodologies for radiation therapy based on the site of service.
Sites operating as an integrated department of the hospital are reimbursed under the Hospital Outpatient Prospective
Payment System (“HOPPS”). Freestanding outpatient radiation therapy providers are reimbursed under the
Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (“MPFS”). Reimbursement rates are typically higher for procedures performed at
a hospital outpatient department (“HOPD”), which are off-campus outpatient centers that are clinically and
financially integrated with the hospital. In recent years, there has been a shift towards site-neutral payments by
lowering payments to HOPDs. In the 2019 final rule, CMS set reimbursement rates for certain HOPD centers equal
to 40% of HOPPS beginning in 2020, with an exception for certain HOPD centers that billed under HOPPS prior to
November 2, 2015.

The oncology segment of the combined company will derive revenue from both HOPPS and MPFS. Approximately
two-thirds of revenue is billed to the health system or hospital partner under contractual arrangements and the


-----

remaining one-third of revenue is billed directly to the payor. For sites that are contracted with hospitals or health
systems, the majority of centers fall under HOPPS. These centers are not subject to some of the recent developments
related to despite the shift to site neutrality, since these centers have either been “grandfathered in” (have been
billing under HOPPS since prior to 2015) or are located on the hospital property. For sites that bill payors directly,
the vast majority of sites bill under MPFS.

Radiation therapy reimbursement has generally remained stable across both Akumin’s and Alliance’s key areas of
service, while site neutrality rules are expected to have minimal impact. Below are the changes in HOPPS and
MPFS reimbursement rates for the last several years.

In December 2015, Congress passed the Patient Access and Medicare Protection Act, which sought to develop an
episodic alternative payment model for radiation therapy services. This resulted in the Radiation Oncology (“RO”)
model, which aims to improve the quality of care for patients while moving towards a simplified and predictable
payment system. The program is expected to go into effect on January 1, 2022 and cover periods through December
2025 for a select set of geographies and 16 disease states representing approximately 30% of eligible episodes. The
model will reimburse providers based on prospective, site neutral, episode-based payments for 90-day episodes.
Participants will be paid in two installments per episode (beginning and end) with reimbursement split into
professional (fee for physician services) and technical components (fee for use of the facility). The program also
includes the reporting of performance on quality measures, clinical data, and patient experience, which will be
factored into payments. We believe that our focus on clinical quality, operational efficiency, and value-based care,
as well as our integrated service line approach, position us well for the new reimbursement model.

**Competitive Strengths**

**_Comprehensive radiology and oncology solutions provider_**

The acquisition of Alliance will enable us to deliver a full suite of outsourced outpatient solutions to hospital, health
system and physician group partners. We believe that radiology and oncology are highly complementary business
lines and there are a number of efficiencies to being able to offer both for our customers. Both radiology and
oncology are clinically sophisticated, critical service lines for hospitals. As a result, hospitals often rely on third
parties to provide these services, and would benefit from being able to procure both services from a single provider.
Providing both services also results in valuable referral network benefits, enables care management opportunities,
and opens the possibility of cost-based initiatives for oncology care. There is often overlap in the radiology and
oncology patient base, since oncology patients require advanced imaging for effective diagnosis and staging
efficient treatment and management of recurrence.

In addition to the clinical benefits of offering both services, the business models of radiology and oncology are
highly complementary. Both businesses are outpatient oriented, providing for significant health system partnership
opportunities and complementary business development approaches. Both specialties have an impact on referral and


-----

patient care journeys and are administratively complex, which represent a key pain point for hospital administrators.
In addition, offering both specialties allows us to take advantage of shared infrastructure, including physician
outreach, strategic marketing, operations, quality and safety, logistics and supply chain, patient scheduling and prior
authorizations, payor relations and contracting, revenue cycle management, accounting and finance, IT, HR, legal,
compliance, and others.

**_Well positioned to take advantage of long-term industry tailwinds_**

We are well positioned to take advantage of many of the long-term trends in healthcare. In recent years, there has
been an enhanced focus on patient experience and customer service. We pride ourselves on a commitment to
excellence and patient satisfaction, including offering quality service, short wait and turnaround times,
compassionate care and convenience to all patients. Our scale and operational expertise enable us to access the latest
advances in technology and information systems and to offer hospital-level expertise within a local setting. Other
trends in healthcare that will benefit us include an increased focus on early detection, strict standards for clinical
quality, measurable patient satisfaction and clinical care productivity and efficiency. Our ability to offer both
radiology and oncology services puts us in a unique position to help detect and accurately diagnose cancer, and to
guide and deliver more targeted, efficient and effective treatments. In addition, our proven approach to improving
operational performance and best-in-class operational infrastructure allows us to deliver care efficiently with high
productivity.

We are well positioned to take advantage of the continued shift in care from inpatient to outpatient as payors and
patients increase their focus on increasing access and convenience and reducing costs. Our longstanding, shared
focus on outpatient care delivery in both hospital and freestanding facilities offers unique expertise for hospitals,
health systems and physician groups. As pressure to move to lower-cost sites of care increases for hospitals, our
ability to assist them with both on and off-campus outpatient solutions will be impactful, as well as our ability to
provide freestanding expertise in convenient locations, with shorter wait times, increased likelihood of subspecialty
interpretations and faster turnaround times.

**_Stable and diversified revenue base_**

We benefit from a well-diversified stream of revenues that span multiple service offerings, geographies, modality
offerings, and physician networks. Pro forma for the Acquisition, we expect we will derive approximately 80% of
our revenue from radiology and 20% of our revenue from oncology. We believe that our diversified service offering
enables us to better serve our health system and hospital partners and offer “one-stop-shopping” for administrators
charged with finding better outsourced solutions.

Pro forma for the Acquisition, our revenue is diversified by payor source, with 52% of revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2020 generated from health systems and hospitals, 32% generated from commercial managed care,
8% from Medicare, 1% from Medicaid and 7% from other sources. We have no material revenue concentration in
any health system or hospital customer or from any commercial insurance payor. We believe that this diversity in
revenue sources decreases the risk to our business from the loss of any single customer or payor relationship, or
changes to reimbursement rates from any single payor.

Where we bill payors directly, we are also in-network with substantially all of our commercial payors and believe
we are the ideal imaging partner for payors who seek to provide high quality care to patients at a low cost. By
partnering with the vast majority of all major payors in our geographic footprint, we are able to provide significant
savings to our payor partners by ensuring patients stay within their networks using our system of conveniently
located facilities. Payor reimbursement levels are negotiated via contracts with each individual payor. These
contracts allow for separate reimbursement schedules for each of the payor’s respective clients, depending on the
members’ individual coverage plan.

Within our radiology segment, we leverage a large network of radiologists, with some radiologists working on-site
and others working remotely. Given our vast network of radiologists and dynamic IT platform, we do not rely
heavily on any single radiologist to drive business. Our scale and density within selected geographies allows us to


-----

create close, long-term relationships with local radiology groups and referring physicians. In addition, our multimodality imaging offering provides a one-stop-shop for patients and referring physicians.

**_Partner of choice for health systems_**

The combined company has developed deep, long-standing relationships with over 1,000 hospitals and healthcare
providers across the country. We are partnered with 25 of the 30 largest U.S. health systems. Our customers are
health systems and hospitals seeking best-in-class partners to enable a capital efficient network and to expand their
U.S. essential outpatient radiology and oncology services.

We believe that healthcare trends will foster hospital- and health-system-centric models even as shifts to lower-cost
outpatient care continue, and will allow the combined company to expand its platform. As hospitals consolidate and
seek partners with regional or national scale and expertise in different clinical settings, the combined company’s
national footprint enables it to leverage its position as a trusted partner to expand its services as an outsourced
service partner. We are focused on building around the hospital’s existing network, patients and partnerships to
assist our partners in delivering a full continuum of care within our communities; this legacy of hospital partnering
will enable the combined company to take advantage of favorable healthcare industry trends such as increasingly
higher hospital expenditures, growing elderly population, higher cancer incidences, and increased patient flows to
hospitals resulting from health system integrations, industry consolidation, and increased covered lives under the
Affordable Care Act.

Additionally, the industry is seeing a shift towards outsourced clinical services. Currently, we estimate that
approximately 90% of hospitals already outsource, or are considering outsourcing, one or more services, and we
estimate that expenditures by hospitals on outsourced services are growing by at least 5% per year. These market
trends will drive demand for services, enabling the combined company to capitalize on its hospital-centric strategy,
providing a platform for expansion.

**_Culture driven by “deep” integration_**

Akumin has significant experience in successfully integrating acquisitions, with more than 100 outpatient diagnostic
imaging centers integrated into our platform to date, excluding the Alliance acquisition. Our integration philosophy
is based on a culture of innovation and standardization of processes.

Given our significant expertise in integrating acquisitions historically, we anticipate a smooth integration process
with Alliance. We expect to achieve the integration through three phases. Phase one will focus on the integration of
all business functions and we expect such integration to be completed within 6 months. We believe that we will be
able to achieve $24 million of cost synergies by the end of phase two, consisting of, among other things, integration
of corporate, field and back office functions and equipment maintenance overhaul. Phase three of the integration
will focus on the opportunity over the longer-term. We plan on consolidating the business into one radiology
segment and one oncology segment. We also plan on integrating the go-to-market strategy, positioning the company
as a comprehensive provider of outsourced solutions.

**_Consumer driven brand development_**

We believe there is a strong cultural fit between the Akumin and Alliance organizations given the mutual focus on
having the consumer or patient at the heart of the company’s strategy. The combined company’s brand will be
defined by intentional engagement with critical decision makers, including a consistent focus on the consumer
(including current or future patients, as well as patients’ loved ones). The consumer is at the heart of our strategy as
increasing out of pocket costs, price transparency and access to sophisticated medical information online are
changing consumer behavior in healthcare services. This is evidenced by the emergence of high deductible health
plans. The percentage of U.S. workers enrolled in high deductible plans with a health savings account increased
from approximately 4% in 2007 to approximately 32% in 2019. Our commitment to outreach, compassionate care,
operational excellence and service delivery optimizes the consumer’s experience at our clinics.


-----

We provide a consistent patient experience, standardized through technology and investments in our people and
processes. All patient facing employees are trained on delivering our brand promises by way of our intentional
values, as well as our policies and procedures. Our brand strategy is focused on aligning our position in the market
for the needs of our patients and partners, so that we are the go-to provider of outpatient diagnostic imaging and/or
radiation therapy services to patients in our service areas. We strive to provide shorter waiting times, convenient
locations, competitive pricing, compassionate and high-quality clinical care, quality equipment and software,
concise interpretations by subspecialty radiologists and top-tier expertise and consistency.

**Business Strategy**

**_Continued strong organic volume growth_**

Our organic growth strategy is based on a sales and marketing platform which utilizes relationships with local
referring physicians and consumer engagement to drive new business. To ensure the continued strength of
relationships with referring physicians, we employ a field-based sales team whose primary responsibility is
establishing new relationships and maintaining existing relationships with referring physicians. Relationships with
new referring physicians are developed through our value proposition (i.e. consistent service, excellent patient care
and referring provider communications, contracts with substantially all payors, convenience and access to top
subspecialty radiologists and radiation oncologists). Existing relationships are maintained by ensuring we continue
to deliver our value proposition in a consistent manner. We stress the importance of operational excellence which
ultimately manifests itself in a better patient experience.

To ensure continuous engagement with the community — including consumers, patients and their loved ones — we
deploy a number of market-specific, direct-to-consumer marketing and communications strategies, focused largely
on digital outreach (e.g., websites, search engine optimization, online reputation management, digital advertising
and social media) and addressing consumers’ most critical questions: how to decide, what to expect, how to prepare,
what they will pay and what will happen next. Our marketing strategies and tactics are coordinated through
centralized resources with expertise in specific areas and on a shared platform to ensure compliance with healthcare
marketing regulations.

Within our radiology segment, in markets with robust demand, we will consider adding modalities in centers that are
currently only single or dual modality centers. Multi-modality centers help diversify risk while contributing
positively to our margins and provide referring physicians with a “one-stop shop” for their patients. To attain growth
and offer a competitive differentiator in key markets, we will also consider replacing or adding new technologies
and equipment. While reimbursement rates may not change with newer equipment, we believe this strategy, in
particularly competitive markets, will offer us a market advantage which will ultimately lead to increased volumes.
An example of this is our investment in 3D digital mammography, which is preferred by many women (who can
self-refer for mammography) and is now being reimbursed by many of the large national insurance payors in
addition to Medicare.

The table below shows year-over-year RVU growth for Akumin on a same-center basis excluding the 2020
Acquisitions (as defined below) and the 2019 Acquisitions (as defined below), except for the acquisition of a single
outpatient diagnostic imaging center in Davie, Florida and pro-rating for the acquisition of single outpatient
diagnostic imaging center in Deltona, Florida and the ADG Acquisitions (each as defined below).

**Akumin Year-over-Year Organic Growth (Same Center RVU Growth)**


The table below shows year-over-year volume growth for Alliance on a same-center basis.


**Alliance Year-over-Year Growth**


**_Cross-sell opportunities_**

We plan to take advantage of cross-sell opportunities of additional services to existing customers. In particular, we
believe that there is a significant competitive advantage to offering both radiology and oncology services to our
hospital customers. Offering both services allows our hospital partners to procure multiple outsourced outpatient


-----

solutions from a single, high-quality provider. We plan to leverage our health system and hospital partnerships in
radiology to cross-sell oncology services and vice-versa.

A few years ago, Alliance made the decision to better integrate its radiology and oncology sales and business
development teams, who now regularly coordinate and collaborate their hospital efforts. We plan to continue and
further strengthen, this sales strategy, with a focus on selling an entire suite of outpatient solutions rather than single
specialty services.

**_Form new hospital partnerships_**

We believe there is an opportunity to enhance existing and form new hospital partnerships as hospitals continue to
accelerate the development of their outpatient care strategies. We believe that these enhancements could result in
enhanced volume growth at existing centers, and the new relationships could result in the potential to open or
service new centers. We plan to leverage the Alliance expertise in forming new, and growing existing, hospital
partnerships.

**_Proven acquisition strategy_**

We have significant experience in acquiring and integrating business into our platform, improving the operational
performance of those businesses, and realizing synergies. Our acquisition strategy is led by our President and Chief
Executive Officer, Riadh Zine. Mr. Zine has grown Akumin through a carefully executed, highly acquisitive,
strategy based on a distinct set of criteria: (i) market density, (ii) market growth potential, (iii) operational
integration potential, (iv) assets and compliance assessment, and (v) attractive valuation multiples. We look to
acquire individual or portfolios of centers that have a meaningful presence in their respective market and a high
potential for organic growth.

**The Transactions**

**_The Acquisition_**

On June 25, 2021, through our wholly-owned indirect subsidiary, Akumin Corp., we entered into a share purchase
agreement (the “Share Purchase Agreement”) to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Thaihot
Investment Company US Limited (“Holdings”), which owns 100% of the common stock of Alliance, from Thaihot
Investment Co., LTD (the “Seller”). The aggregate purchase price payable to the Seller at the Closing is
$820,000,000 (the “Purchase Price”), which will include the issuance to the Seller of 14,223,570 of our common
shares (the “Share Consideration”). The cash purchase price of the Acquisition will be funded through a
combination of the proceeds from the Notes offered hereby and the financing transactions described below under “–
The Financings” and under “The Transactions – Summary of the Acquisition.”

**_The Financings_**

In connection with the Acquisition, Stonepeak Magnet Holdings LP (“Stonepeak”) has committed, subject to the
satisfaction of certain conditions precedent to funding, (the “Stonepeak Note Commitment”) to purchase a minimum
of $200,000,000 aggregate principal amount and a maximum of $689,570,000 aggregate principal amount of senior
unsecured notes of Akumin Corp. as acquisition financing to fund the purchase price of the Acquisition. Any such
notes issued on the date of Closing are referred to as “Initial Financing Notes” and the Initial Financing Notes
together with any such notes issued after the date of Closing are referred to as “Financing Notes.” In addition, in
connection with such Stonepeak Note Commitment, we will issue to Stonepeak 3,500,000 of our common shares
(the “Financing Common Shares”) at the Issue Price for approximately $10,430,000 and warrants to purchase
Akumin Common Shares equal to 15% of the principal amount of the Initial Financing Notes, divided by the Issue
Price (the “Financing Warrants”). We expect on the date of Closing to issue approximately $200,000,000 of Initial
Financing Notes.

The aggregate net proceeds from the Notes offered hereby will reduce on a dollar-for-dollar basis (subject to the
minimum subscription of $200,000,000) the aggregate amount of the Stonepeak Note Commitment to be provided
by Stonepeak at the time of Closing to fund the purchase price in the Acquisition; provided, we expect that, after


-----

giving effect to the sale of the Notes offered hereby, $489,570,000 in principal amount of Financing Notes will
remain available to be issued by Akumin Corp. and subscribed for by Stonepeak for a three-year period following
the Closing, provided certain conditions are met. The proceeds of any such future incurrence of Financing Notes will
be used to finance Akumin’s organic growth as well as future acquisition opportunities that are agreed by
Stonepeak.

See “The Transactions – Summary of the Financings.”

**_Escrow Agreement_**

If this offering closes prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, the Escrow Issuer will deposit concurrently with
the closing of this offering, the gross proceeds from the sale of the Notes offered hereby plus an amount sufficient to
pay interest with respect to the Notes up to, but not including, the then applicable latest possible Special Mandatory
Redemption Date into an escrow account. The release of the escrow proceeds will be subject to the satisfaction of
certain conditions, including the consummation of the Acquisition. If the Acquisition is not consummated by
October 25, 2021 (as such date may be extended as described under “Description of Notes—Escrow of Proceeds;
Special Mandatory Redemption” but no later than January 24, 2022, the “Outside Date”), or upon the occurrence of
certain other events, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption. The special mandatory redemption
price will be a price equal to 100% of the initial issue price of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
from the Issue Date up to, but not including, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date. If the closing of the
Acquisition has occurred at or prior to the time of the consummation of the offering of Notes, we will forego the
escrow procedures described in this offering memorandum. See “Description Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special
Mandatory Redemption.”

The Acquisition, the issuance of the Initial Financing Notes, the issuance of the Financing Common Shares and the
Financing Warrants and the issuance of the Notes offered hereby, the performance of our obligations under the
Escrow Agreement and the use of proceeds from this offering as described in ‘‘Use of Proceeds’’ are collectively
referred to in this offering memorandum as the “Transactions.” Except as otherwise indicated, financial data
identified in this offering memorandum as “pro forma” gives effect to the consummation of the Transactions.

**Recent Developments**

**_Management_**

In connection with the Acquisition we expect that, following the closing of the Acquisition, Riadh Zine-El-Abidine
will serve as chairman and co-chief executive officer, Rhonda Longmore-Grund will serve as president and co-chief
executive officer, William Larkin will serve as chief financial officer and Mohammad Saleem, will be named Senior
Vice President of Financial Reporting. Other senior officer positions will be announced as determined in connection
with the Acquisition.

**_Tuck-in Acquisitions_**

In the ordinary course of our business, we continually evaluate acquisition opportunities. As of the date of this
offering memorandum, subsequent to March 31, 2021, we have consummated acquisitions of, in the aggregate, 10
facilities (the “Tuck-in Acquisitions”). We estimate that the aggregate annual adjusted EBITDA attributable to the
Tuck-in Acquisitions for the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2021, is approximately $8.9 million based on
financial information and other data provided by the targets to such acquisitions, inclusive of management’s
estimates of cost synergies resulting from such Tuck-in Acquisitions. Management’s estimate of adjusted EBITDA
attributable to these Tuck-in Acquisitions is based on the financial information of each of the facilities that were
made available to management by such targets and such data has not been reviewed, compiled, examined or audited
by outside accountants. We cannot assure you that the financial data derived from the internal books and records of
such entities would not be materially different if such financial data had been subject to an independent audit, review
or examination. These amounts are presented for informational purposes only and do not purport to represent our
results had these Tuck-in Acquisitions been acquired by us for the periods presented and may contain adjustments,
including adjustments related to the business impact of COVID-19, which are different from those that we use in
preparing similar measures. Undue reliance should not be placed on them. Our estimates of the Adjusted EBITDA
attributable to these Tuck-in Acquisitions may not be indicative of any future results of such facilities. In addition,
we may not realize some or all of the cost synergies that we estimate will be attributable to such Tuck-in
Acquisitions. Our ability to realize these cost synergies is subject to significant uncertainties and you should not
place undue reliance on the adjustments in evaluating our anticipated results.

**_Securitization_**

We are in preliminary discussions with PNC regarding a securitization facility of $40 million to be entered into with
our unrestricted subsidiary Akumin Receivables, LLC. In connection with such facility, we expect to either
contribute or sell receivables assets to the unrestricted subsidiary to be securitized pursuant to such facility.

**_Credit Agreement Amendment_**

On July 26, 2021, we entered into an amendment to the Revolving Credit Agreement (as defined herein) to, among
other things, permit the Acquisition.

the assets or property securing such obligations including, on a pro forma
basis after giving effect to the transactions as of March 31, 2021,
approximately $79 million of finance leases, including the equipment
financing to be assumed from Alliance, and $1.0 million related to the face

and other liabilities of our subsidiaries, minority investments and any
professional service affiliates that do not guarantee the Notes.

(at face value) of outstanding debt (including the Notes offered hereby, the 2025
Senior Notes, the Initial Financing Notes and finance leases, but excluding other
lease liabilities), $1,054 of which would have been secured indebtedness. In
addition, on adjusted pro forma basis after giving effect to this offering and the
Transactions, as of March 31, 2021 we would have had $0.1 million of issued
and undrawn letters of credit outstanding and $55 million of unused
commitments under our Revolving Credit Facility that are available to be
borrowed thereunder to the extent the indenture governing the Notes permits
such incurrence. We will also be permitted, following the Closing, subject to
the covenants in the indenture that will govern the Notes, the 2025 Senior Notes
Indenture, and the Revolving Credit Facility, to draw up to approximately $490
million in additional Financing Notes pursuant to the Stonepeak Notes
Commitment. See “Capitalization.”

consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial
statements and, in the opinion of management, include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments,
necessary for a fair statement of the results for those periods. Results for the three-month period ended March 31,
2021 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year or as of any future date.

The results of operations (including, without limitation, statements of income) of ADG Acquisition Holdings, Inc.,
TIC Acquisition Holdings, LLC and SFL Radiology Holdings, LLC, the businesses acquired in connection with the
ADG Acquisitions (as defined herein) are included in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive
income (loss) from June 1, 2019 (the date following the date of acquisition) and not for any prior period. Balance
sheet data as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 include the businesses acquired in connection with the ADG
Acquisitions. For additional information on the ADG Acquisitions, see Note 3 to our audited financial statements
included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

The pro forma financial information and data presented below, prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation
S-X, are based on the Akumin audited consolidated financial statements, adjusted to give effect to the Acquisition.
See “Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information.” The unaudited consolidated pro forma balance
sheet data as of March 31, 2021 gives effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on March 31, 2021. The
unaudited consolidated pro forma statements of operations data for the year ended December 31, 2020 and for the
three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 give effect to the Acquisition as if it had occurred as of January 1,
2020. The pro forma financial information is unaudited and does not purport to be indicative of the results which
actually would have occurred if the Acquisition had been consummated as described herein, nor does it purport to
represent the future financial position and results of operations for future periods.

The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements data has been prepared by our management for
illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the consolidated financial position or results of
operations that would have been realized had the Acquisition occurred on the dates indicated, nor is it meant to be
indicative of any future consolidated financial position or future results of operations that the combined company
will experience. Pro forma adjustments reflected in the pro forma financial statements are based on available
information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable and supportable, and do not reflect the cost of
any integration activities or benefits from the Acquisition, including potential synergies that may be derived in
future periods.

The summary unaudited consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss for the twelve-month period
ended March 31, 2021 has been derived from the historical consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive
loss data for the year ended December 31, 2020, adding the historical consolidated statement of operations and
comprehensive income for the three-month period ended March 31, 2021 and subtracting the historical consolidated
statement of operations and comprehensive income for the three-month period ended March 31, 2020, and have
been included in this offering memorandum to provide investors with information for the latest twelve-month
period. The summary unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss for the
twelve-month period ended March 31, 2021 has been derived from the unaudited pro forma consolidated statement
of operations and comprehensive loss data for the year ended December 31, 2020, adding the unaudited pro forma
consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income for the three-month period ended March 31, 2021
and subtracting the unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income for the
three-month period ended March 31, 2020, and have been included in this offering memorandum to provide

(1) Total debt for Akumin standalone consists of borrowing under our previous credit agreement (that was refinanced in November 2020 by the
2025 Senior Notes), subordinated notes earn-out, Wesley Chapel Loan, derivative financial instrument liabilities (which were terminated in
November 2020) and leases (including finance leases and other leases), including both the current and non-current portions. Other lease
liabilities were $132,299 and $129,050 as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, and $130,281 and $133,380 as of
March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020, respectively.

(2) Total debt at face value, excluding other lease liabilities for Akumin standalone consists of total debt, excluding other lease liabilities except
that the borrowing under our previous credit agreement (that was refinanced in November 2020 by the 2025 Senior Notes), and Wesley
Chapel Loan are noted at face value. Other lease liabilities were $132,299 and $129,050 as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019,
respectively and $130,281 and $133,380 as of March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020, respectively.

March 31, 2021 after giving effect to the issuance of the Notes and the Transactions, including the assumption of approximately $63 million
in Alliance capital leases. See “Capitalization” and “Use of Proceeds”. On a pro forma basis after giving effect to this offering and the
Transactions, as of March 31, 2021 we would have had $0.1 million of issued and undrawn letters of credit outstanding and $55 million of
unused commitments under our Revolving Credit Facility that are available to be borrowed thereunder to the extent the indenture governing
the Notes permits such incurrence. We will also be permitted, following the Closing, subject to the covenants in the indenture that will
govern the Notes, the 2025 Senior Notes Indenture, and the Revolving Credit Facility, to draw up to approximately $490 million in
Financing Notes pursuant to the Stonepeak Notes Commitment.

(4) Pro Forma Total Net Debt is total debt at face value including $200 million Initial Financing Notes and excluding other lease liabilities as of
March 31, 2021 after giving effect to the issuance of the Notes and the Transactions, including the assumption of approximately $63 million
in Alliance capital leases, minus approximately $34.1 million of unrestricted cash (which cash amount is estimated as set forth under
“Capitalization”). See “Capitalization” and “Use of Proceeds”. On a pro forma basis after giving effect to this offering and the
Transactions, as of March 31, 2021 we would have had $0.1 million of issued and undrawn letters of credit outstanding and $55 million of
unused commitments under our Revolving Credit Facility that are available to be borrowed thereunder to the extent the indenture governing
the Notes permits such incurrence. We will also be permitted, following the Closing, subject to the covenants in the indenture that will
govern the Notes, the 2025 Senior Notes Indenture, and the Revolving Credit Facility, to draw up to approximately $490 million in
Financing Notes pursuant to the Stonepeak Notes Commitment.

(5) Pro Forma Total Secured Debt is total debt at face value excluding the Initial Financing Notes (which are unsecured) and other lease
liabilities that is secured by liens on our assets as of March 31, 2021 after giving effect to the issuance of the Notes and the Transactions,
including the assumption of approximately $63 million in Alliance capital leases. See “Capitalization” and “Use of Proceeds”. On a pro
forma basis after giving effect to this offering and the Transactions, as of March 31, 2021 we would have had $0.1 million of issued and
undrawn letters of credit outstanding and $55 million of unused commitments under our Revolving Credit Facility that are available to be
borrowed thereunder to the extent the indenture governing the Notes permits such incurrence.

(6) Pro Forma Total Net Secured Debt is total debt at face value excluding the Initial Financing Notes (which are unsecured) and other lease
liabilities that is secured by liens on our assets as of March 31, 2021 after giving effect to the issuance of the Notes and after giving effect to

unrestricted cash (which cash amount is estimated as set forth under “Capitalization”). See “Capitalization” and “Use of Proceeds”. On a
pro forma basis after giving effect to this offering and the Transactions, as of March 31, 2021 we would have had $0.1 million of issued and
undrawn letters of credit outstanding and $55 million of unused commitments under our Revolving Credit Facility that are available to be
borrowed thereunder to the extent the indenture governing the Notes permits such incurrence.

**Non-GAAP Metrics:**

We present certain non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are not recognized measures under GAAP and
do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar
measures presented by other companies. Rather, these non-GAAP measures are provided as additional information
to complement our GAAP measures by providing further understanding of our results of operations from
management’s perspective. Accordingly, these non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation nor as a
substitute for analysis of our financial information reported under GAAP. We use non-GAAP financial measures,
including “EBITDA”, “Adjusted EBITDA”, “Adjusted EBITDA Margin”, “Adjusted EBITDA Normalized for
COVID-19” and “Free Cash Flow”. These non-GAAP measures are used to provide investors with supplemental
measures of our operating performance and thus highlight trends in our core business that may not otherwise be
apparent when relying solely on GAAP measures. We believe the use of these non-GAAP measures, along with
GAAP financial measures, enhances the understanding of our operating results and is useful to us and to investors in
comparing performance with competitors, estimating enterprise value and making investment decisions. We also
believe that securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use non-GAAP measures in the
evaluation of issuers. Our management also uses non-GAAP measures in order to facilitate operating performance
comparisons from period to period, to prepare annual operating budgets and forecasts and to determine components
of management compensation. In addition, these non-GAAP measures should not be considered as an alternative to
net income or any other performance measures in accordance with GAAP.

**Adjusted EBITDA Normalized**
**for COVID-19, management**
**adjustments and synergies** 213,282

(i) **Adjusted EBITDA Normalized for COVID-19 for Akumin is Adjusted EBITDA for the LTM period ended March 31,**
2021 plus a “COVID-19 Adjustment” of approximately $9 million. This amount of this adjustment was estimated by
multiplying the incremental RVU volume (as calculated in the last sentence of this definition) of approximately 0.428
million RVUs by: (i) the service fee net revenue per RVU of $42.57 for the LTM period ended March 31, 2021, and (ii) a
minimum incremental contribution margin estimated to be approximately 49%. That minimum incremental contribution
margin assumes that operating costs for employee compensation, reading fees, medical supplies and other expenses, which
together represented 51% of net revenue for the LTM period ended June 30, 2020, are 100% variable and therefore we
believe any incremental $1.00 of revenue equates to $0.49 of incremental EBITDA. The incremental RVU volume was
determined by annualizing the RVU volume for the three-month period ended March 31, 2021 of approximately 1.515
million RVUs less the actual RVU volume for the LTM period ended March 31, 2021 of approximately 5.632 million
RVUs. Adjusted EBITDA Normalized for COVID-19 is a non-GAAP financial measure and has been calculated assuming
that our RVU volume of 1.515 million RVUs for the three-month period ended March 31, 2021 applied to each quarter in
the four quarter period ended March 31, 2021. There can be no assurance that the RVU volume for the three month period
ended March 31, 2021 would have been indicative of the RVU volume for any quarter included in the LTM period ended
March 31, 2021 had the COVID-19 pandemic not affected our business and the economy generally. Adjusted EBITDA
**Normalized for COVID-19 for Alliance is Adjusted EBITDA for the LTM period ended March 31, 2021 plus a**
“COVID-19 Adjustment” of approximately $18 million. This amount of this adjustment was estimated by determining the
estimated decrease in scan volumes for MRIs and PET/CT by subtracting the average scan volumes for the twelve monthsended March 31, 2021 from the average scan volumes for the year ended December 31, 2019 and multiplying the average
decrease determined by such calculation for each of MRI and PET/CT by the actual revenues per scan for the year ended
December 31, 2019 for each of MRI and PET/CT, which resulted in an estimated decrease in revenues of $59 million. The
corresponding Adjusted EBITDA amount was determined by multiplying $59 million by the operating margin of 38% for
the year ended December 31, 2019 and subtracting approximately $4 million of costs associated with one-time furloughed
employee costs. There can be no assurance that average scan volume for the year ended December 31, 2019 would have
been indicative of the average scan volumes for any quarter included in the LTM period ended March 31, 2021 had the
COVID-19 pandemic not affected our business and the economy generally.

(ii) For Akumin, represents approximately $9 million of additional Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended March 31,
2021 from 10 facilities that were acquired by Akumin subsequent to March 31, 2021. See “Summary – Recent Developments
– Tuck-in Acquisitions.” For Alliance represents deductions to Adjusted EBITDA equal to (i) $8.9 million resulting from
discontinued operations and the sale of certain legal entities and business units in 2020 and since the end of the year ended
December 31, 2020, including the sale of Alliance’s Interventional Division. and (ii) $7.4 million resulting from Alliance
suspending its management incentive compensation plan (“MIP”) in 2020 as the result of the COVID-19 pandemic, had the
MIP been paid at 100% of target there would have been an $7.4 million incremental expense after minority interest in the
year ended December 31, 2020.

(iii) Represents approximately $24 million of cost synergies expected by the end of phase two, consisting of, among other things,
integration of corporate, field and back office functions and equipment maintenance overhaul. We may be unable to realize
all of these synergies within the timeframe expected or at all, and we may incur additional and/or unexpected costs in order
to realize them.

(2) Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Revenues.

(3) The following table reconciles Free Cash Flow to Adjusted EBITDA. See footnote 1 above for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the

**SUMMARY HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND OTHER DATA -**
**ALLIANCE**

The following tables set forth Alliance’s summary historical consolidated audited and unaudited financial
information for the periods and dates indicated. The summary historical consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive loss for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and balance sheet data as of December 31,
2020 have been derived from Alliance’s audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this
offering memorandum.

The summary historical unaudited consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the three-month
periods ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 and balance sheet data as of March 31, 2021 have been derived from
Alliance’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited
consolidated financial statements and, in the opinion of management, include all adjustments, consisting of normal
recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the results for those periods. Results for the three-month
period ended March 31, 2021 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year or as
of any future date.

The summary unaudited consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss for the twelve-month period
ended March 31, 2021 has been derived from the historical consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive
loss data for the year ended December 31, 2020, adding the historical consolidated statement of operations and
comprehensive loss for the three-month period ended March 31, 2021 and subtracting the historical consolidated
statement of operations and comprehensive loss for the three-month period ended March 31, 2020, and have been
included in this offering memorandum to provide investors with information for the latest twelve-month period.

The following historical consolidated and unaudited pro forma financial information is only a summary and should
be read in conjunction with the sections entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations - Alliance” and “Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information” and
Alliance’s historical audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included

**Non-GAAP Metrics:**

Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP. Alliance believes, in addition to GAAP
metrics, this non-GAAP metric is a useful measure for investors for a variety of reasons. Alliance’s management
regularly communicates Adjusted EBITDA and their interpretation of such results to its Board. Alliance also
compares actual periodic Adjusted EBITDA against internal targets as a key factor in determining cash incentive
compensation for executives and other employees, largely because it views Adjusted EBITDA results as indicative
of how its Radiology and Oncology businesses are performing and being managed.

Alliance defines Adjusted EBITDA as net loss attributable to Alliance HealthCare Services, Inc. before: income
taxes; net income attributable to non-controlling interest; interest expense, net; depreciation expense; amortization
expense; transaction costs; restructuring charges; impairment charges; severance and related costs; loss on
extinguishment or modification of debt; legal matters and other expenses; share-based compensation; and other
charges (benefits), net.

The presentation of a non-GAAP metric does not imply that the reconciling items presented are non-recurring,
infrequent or unusual. In general, non-GAAP metrics have certain limitations as analytical financial measures and
are used in conjunction with GAAP results to evaluate operating performance and by considering independently the
economic effects of the items that are or are not reflected in non-GAAP metrics. Alliance compensates for such
limitations by providing GAAP-based disclosures concerning the excluded items in our financial disclosures. As a
result of these limitations, and because non-GAAP metrics may not be directly comparable to similarly titled
measures reported by other companies, the non-GAAP metrics are not an alternative to the most directly comparable
GAAP measure or any other GAAP measure of operating performance.

The reconciliation of net loss to adjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization
(“Adjusted EBITDA”) is shown below:

**RISK FACTORS**

_You should carefully consider each of the following risk factors, together with all of the information set forth in this_
_offering memorandum, before deciding to invest in the Notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not_
_the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or those we currently deem_
_immaterial, may also become important and material factors that affect us. If any of the following risks and_
_uncertainties develops into actual events, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or_
_prospects could be materially adversely affected and you could lose all or part of your original investment._

**Risks Related to the Acquisition**

**_We may not be able to consummate the Acquisition._**

Consummation of the Acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including the expiration or termination
of any applicable waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the HSR Act. Although we expect that all
required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that these regulatory clearances
and approvals will be obtained in a timely manner, obtained at all or that the granting of these regulatory clearances
and approvals will not involve the imposition of additional conditions on the completion of the Acquisition,
including the requirement to divest assets or require changes to the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement. The
Share Purchase Agreement also contains certain customary provisions, such as termination rights for both Akumin
and Alliance, including, among others, for failure to consummate the merger on or before October 23, 2021 (which
Outside Date may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties for an additional 90 days), and termination fees
payable under specified circumstances. See “The Transactions.”

**_Significant costs have been incurred in connection with the consummation of the Acquisition and are expected to_**
**_be incurred in connection with the integration of Akumin and Alliance into a combined company, including_**
**_legal, accounting, financial advisory and other costs._**

We expect to incur costs to achieve the expected cost-savings in connection with the Acquisition by the end of 2021,
which may be significant any may be ongoing for the foreseeable future. In addition, we expect to incur a number of
non-recurring costs associated with combining our operations with those of Alliance which cannot be estimated
accurately at this time. We expect to incur approximately $28 million of transaction fees and other costs related to
the consummation of the Transactions. Additional unanticipated costs may yet be incurred as we integrate our
business with that of Alliance. Although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the
realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of our operations with those of Alliance, may offset
incremental transaction and transaction-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term,
or at all. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our integration efforts.

**_The Financing Notes will increase our indebtedness and interest expense, and subject us to significant restrictions._**

Akumin Corp. will incur additional indebtedness in connection with the issuance of the Financing Notes, including
the Initial Financing Notes, which will, at a minimum, consist of aggregate principal amount of $200 million and, at
the maximum, consist of aggregate principal amount of approximately $690 million. We will pay higher interest rates
on the Financing Notes in comparison to our other indebtedness. Additionally, we have the right under the Financing
Notes to elect to pay interest in-kind in the form of additional Financing Notes (“PIK”) for the first two years from
the issuance of such Financing Notes. If we elect to pay PIK interest, this will further increase our indebtedness and
we will pay PIK interest at a rate of 13% per annum, as opposed to 11% per annum for interest on the Financing Notes
that is not PIK. Furthermore, if we are subject to a change of control for purposes of the Financing Notes, we may
voluntarily repurchase or be required to repurchase the Financing Notes at a higher price than we will be required to
make with respect to the 2025 Senior Notes or the Notes. The Financing Notes will restrict our ability to incur
additional indebtedness in excess of a total leverage ratio of 4.5:1.0, so our ability to raise capital in the future may be
limited. The Financing, including the Financing Notes, will allow Stonepeak to exert significant control over us.
Among other things, so long as at least $100 million of the Financing Notes remain outstanding, Stonepeak will have


-----

the right to nominate one director to the combined company’s board of directors. See “Transactions – Summary of the
Financings.”

**_We do not currently control the acquired business and will not control the acquired business until completion of_**
**_the Acquisition._**

Although Alliance is subject to certain interim operating covenants in the Share Purchase Agreement, Akumin does
not currently control Alliance and will not control it until the completion of the Acquisition. Until that time, Akumin
cannot assure you that Alliance will be operated in the same way that it would be operated if it had been under our
control during such period. The covenants in the indenture will not apply to Alliance and its subsidiaries until the
consummation of the Acquisition.

**_We may not realize the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition._**

We may not be able to successfully integrate Alliance’s operations with our own, and we may not realize all or any
of the expected benefits of the Acquisition as and when planned. The integration of Alliance’s operations with our
own will be complex, costly and time-consuming. We expect that it will require significant attention from senior
management and will impose substantial demands on our operations and personnel, potentially diverting attention
from other important pending projects. The difficulties and risks associated with the integration of Alliance include:

- the possibility that we will fail to implement our business plans for the combined company, including as a result of
legislation or regulation that affects the timing or costs associated with the operations of the combined company or
our integration plan;

- possible inconsistencies in the standards, controls, procedures, policies and compensation structures of the two
companies;

- limitations prior to the consummation of the acquisition on our ability to work with Alliance management to
develop an integration plan;

- the increased scope and complexity of our operations;

- the entry by us into new lines of business;

- requirements, if any, to divest certain of our businesses;

- the potential loss of key employees and the costs associated with our efforts to retain key employees;

- provisions in our and Alliance’s contracts with third parties that may limit our flexibility to take certain actions;

- risks and limitations on our ability to consolidate corporate and administrative infrastructures of the two
companies;

- undisclosed liabilities of Alliance for which we, as a successor owner, may be responsible;

- obligations that we will have to holders of our indebtedness, including Stonepeak; and

- the possibility of unanticipated delays, costs or inefficiencies associated with the integration of Alliance’s
operations with our own.

As a result of these difficulties and risks, we may not accomplish the integration of the two companies smoothly,
successfully or within our budgetary expectations and anticipated timetable. Accordingly, we may fail to realize
some or all of the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition, such as financial and operational benefits, including
increased revenues and cost savings.

**_We may be unable to realize the anticipated synergies from the Acquisition or may incur additional and/or_**
**_unexpected costs in order to realize them._**


-----

We are implementing a series of cost savings initiatives at the combined company that we expect to result in
synergies resulting from the Acquisition. For example, we believe that we will be able to achieve $24 million of cost
synergies by the end of phase two, consisting of, among other things, integration of corporate, field and back office
functions and equipment maintenance overhaul. We may be unable to realize all of these synergies within the
timeframe expected or at all, and we may incur additional and/or unexpected costs in order to realize them.

**_Our operating results after the Acquisition may materially differ from the pro forma information presented in_**
**_this offering memorandum._**

The pro forma consolidated financial information contained in this offering memorandum is intended to illustrate the
effect of the Acquisition and may not be an indication of our financial condition or results of operations following
the Acquisition for several reasons. Adjustments and assumptions have been made after giving effect to the
Acquisition. The information upon which these adjustments and assumptions have been made is preliminary, and
these kinds of adjustments and assumptions are difficult to make with accuracy. Our operating results after the
Acquisition may be materially different from those described in the adjusted pro forma information contained in this
offering memorandum. Among other things, the merger, financing, integration, restructuring and transaction costs
related to the Acquisition could be higher or lower than currently estimated, depending on how difficult it will be to
integrate our business with that of Alliance.

**_As a result of the Acquisition, we may not be able to retain key personnel or recruit additional qualified_**
**_personnel, which could materially affect our business and require us to incur substantial additional costs to_**
**_recruit replacement personnel._**

We are highly dependent on the continuing efforts of our senior management team and other key personnel. As a
result of the Acquisition, our current and prospective employees, including Alliance employees, could experience
uncertainty about their future roles. This uncertainty may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain current and
prospective key management, sales, marketing and technical personnel. Any failure to attract and retain key
personnel, including Alliance employees, could have a material adverse effect on our business after consummation
of the Acquisition. In addition, we currently do not maintain ‘‘key person’’ insurance covering any member of our
management team.

**_We may not be able to enforce claims with respect to the representations and warranties that the Seller will_**
**_provide under the Share Purchase Agreement._**

In connection with the Acquisition, the Seller will give certain limited representations and warranties under the
Share Purchase Agreement. We may not be able to enforce any claims against the Seller including any claims
relating to breaches of such representations and warranties. The Seller’s liability with respect to breaches of its
representations and warranties under the Share Purchase Agreement, or the amount and coverage of any insurance
obtained with respect to such representations and warranties, is limited.

**_Uncertainty regarding the Acquisition may cause customers and suppliers to delay or defer decisions concerning_**
**_us and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations._**

The Acquisition will occur only if stated conditions are met, many of which are outside the control of Akumin and
Alliance, and both parties also have rights to terminate the Share Purchase Agreement under specified circumstances.
Accordingly, there may be uncertainty regarding the completion of the Acquisition. This uncertainty may cause
customers and suppliers to delay or defer decisions concerning Akumin and/or Alliance, which could negatively affect
our business. Customers, payors and suppliers may also seek to change existing agreements with Akumin and/or
Alliance as a result of the Acquisition. Any delay or deferral of those decisions or changes in existing agreements
could have a material adverse effect on the respective businesses of Akumin and Alliance, regardless of whether the
Acquisition is ultimately completed.

**Risks Related to Our Business**

**_We face various risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks, including the global outbreak of_**
**_COVID-19, which may have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations_**
**_and cash flows._**

On January 31, 2020, the Secretary of U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) declared a national
public health emergency due to a novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”). On March 11, 2020, the World Health
Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19, a disease caused by this novel coronavirus, a pandemic. This
disease continues to spread throughout the United States and other parts of the world. The COVID-19 pandemic is
significantly affecting our employees, patients, facilities, communities and business operations, as well as the
U.S. and Canadian economy and financial markets. As the COVID-19 crisis continues to evolve, the full extent to
which the COVID-19 outbreak will impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity will
depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted. For example, we are
not able to predict or control the severity or duration of the pandemic, including whether there will be additional
periods of increases in the number of COVID-19 cases in areas in which we operate, the timing and availability of
effective medical treatments and vaccines or the efficacy of public health controls.

At this stage, we have no certainty as to how long the pandemic, or a more limited epidemic, will last, what regions
will be most affected or to what extent containment measures will be applied. Imaging and oncology centers are
healthcare facilities and as such are generally considered an essential service and expected to continue to operate
during any epidemic or pandemic. However, there is potential that actions taken by government, or referring
physicians or individual actions, in response to containment or avoidance of this coronavirus could impact a
patient’s ability or decision to seek medical services at a given time which could have a significant impact on
volume at our centers leading to temporary or prolonged staff layoffs, reduced hours, closures and other cost
containment efforts. Further, there is potential that certain services which are not urgent and can be deferred without
significant harm to a patient’s health may be delayed, either by us in response to local laws or good public health
practice or voluntarily by the patient. In addition, there is potential that the outbreak of the coronavirus could impact
supply chains, including our supply of personal protective equipment, and lead to personnel shortages, each of
which could impact our ability to safely perform imaging and oncology services. It is also possible that social
distancing efforts and sanitization and decontamination procedures could cause delays in the performance of
imaging and oncology services. Depending on the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is
potential for us to incur incremental credit losses beyond what is currently expected and potential reduction in
revenue and income and asset impairments.

We face various risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks, including the global outbreak of COVID-19.
The COVID-19 pandemic, changes in patient behavior related to illness, pandemic fears and market downturns, and
restrictions intended to slow the spread of COVID-19, including quarantines, government-mandated actions,
stay-at-home orders and other restrictions, have led to disruption of our business and volatility in the global capital
markets. The United States government has taken steps to attempt to mitigate some of the more severe anticipated
economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the passage of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic
Security Act (“CARES Act”). Additionally, we have received certain funding and other relief under the CARES
Act, as described more fully herein. Nonetheless, no assurance that such types of measures and funding whether
already enacted or to be enacted will be effective or achieve their desired results in a timely fashion, including as it
relates to our business operations. Moreover, while we believe we are in compliance with the applicable terms and
conditions of funding under the CARES Act, compliance-related guidance for the program remains in process, and
we may face enforcement risk if we are found to have failed to comply with such terms and conditions.

If significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,
including because of illness, quarantines, facility closures, ineffective remote work arrangements, supply chain
disruptions or technology failures or limitations, our operations would be adversely impacted. We have already
incurred and will continue to incur additional costs related to protecting the health and well-being and meeting the
needs of our patients, employees, medical staff members and contractors. We expect to continue to incur additional
costs, which may be significant, as we continue to implement operational changes in response to this pandemic. We
may also face liability to the extent we receive claims from our employees, customers or related third-parties
alleging exposure to COVID-19 in connection with our operations or at one of our facilities. In addition, we may be
subject to a governmental enforcement action if we fail to comply with applicable health and safety regulations.


-----

Our results of operations have been and will be negatively impacted by these developments. In addition, changes to
statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies or practices as a result of, or in response to COVID-19, could affect us in
substantial and unpredictable ways. Although social contact restrictions have eased across the U.S. and most states
have lifted moratoriums on non-emergent procedures, some restrictions remain in place, and some states are reimposing certain restrictions due to increasing rates of COVID-19 cases. Further, additional closings and restrictions
on hours and services may occur for an unpredictable amount of time. In particular, we have significant operations
in geographies that are deemed “hot spots” such as Florida and Texas, two of our major markets, that continue to
experience increases in COVID-19 infections. Due to the concentration of our facilities in Texas and Florida, we are
particularly sensitive to the increase in COVID-19 cases in those states, where the pandemic could have a
disproportionate effect on our business. Given the many uncertainties and far reaching consequences of potential
developments, we cannot ensure that the COVID-19 outbreak and the many related impacts will not require
extended or additional imaging center closures and other disruptions to our business or will not materially and
adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition in the period beyond March 31, 2021.

Broad economic factors resulting from the current COVID-19 pandemic, including high unemployment and
underemployment rates and reduced consumer spending and confidence, also affect our service mix, revenue mix
payor mix and patient volumes, as well as our ability to collect outstanding receivables. Business closings and
layoffs in the areas where we operate may lead to increases in the uninsured and underinsured populations and
adversely affect demand for our services, as well as the ability of patients and other payors to pay for services
rendered. Any increase in the amount or deterioration in the collectability of patient accounts receivable will
adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations, requiring an increased level of working capital. In addition,
our results and financial condition may be adversely affected by federal, state or local laws, regulations, orders, or
other governmental or regulatory actions addressing the current COVID-19 pandemic or the U.S. health care system,
which could result in direct or indirect restrictions to our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
flow.

**_Our strategy to grow our business through acquisitions is subject to significant risks._**

A key component of our strategy to grow our business is to complete additional outpatient diagnostic imaging and
oncology center acquisitions to expand our product range and increase our revenues. Accordingly, we will be
dependent upon our ability to enter into acquisition agreements that we believe are consistent with our business
strategy. Risks in acquiring new outpatient diagnostic imaging and oncology centers include: (a) our ability to locate
new centers that are attractive and complement our business; and (b) our ability to acquire these centers at attractive
acquisition prices. We also face competition from other outpatient diagnostic imaging companies and oncology
providers in acquiring outpatient diagnostic imaging and oncology centers, which makes it more difficult to find
attractive products on acceptable terms. Accordingly, we may not be able to acquire rights to additional outpatient
diagnostic imaging and oncology centers on acceptable terms, if at all. Further, we may not be able to obtain future
financing for new acquisitions on acceptable terms, if at all or obtain consent of Stonepeak under the Financing
Notes. Our inability to complete acquisitions of additional outpatient diagnostic imaging and oncology centers could
limit the overall growth of our business.

**_We experience competition from other outpatient diagnostic imaging companies and hospitals, and this_**
**_competition could adversely affect our revenue and business._**

The market for outpatient diagnostic imaging and oncology services is highly competitive. We compete principally
on the basis of our reputation, our ability to provide multiple modalities at many of our centers, the location of our
centers and the quality of our outpatient diagnostic imaging and oncology services. We compete locally with groups
of radiologists, established hospitals, clinics and other independent organizations that own and operate imaging
equipment. Our competitors include, among others: Radnet, Inc., SimonMed Imaging LLC and InSight Health
Services Corp. Some of our competitors may now or in the future have access to greater financial resources than we
do and may have access to newer, more advanced equipment. In addition, some physician practices have established
their own outpatient diagnostic imaging and oncology centers within their group practices and compete with us. We
are experiencing increased competition as a result of such activities, and if we are unable to successfully compete,
our business and financial condition would be adversely affected.


-----

**_Our failure to integrate the businesses we acquire successfully and on a timely basis could reduce our_**
**_profitability._**

We may never realize expected synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects in connection with our
acquisitions. We may experience increased competition that limits our ability to expand our business. We may not
be able to capitalize on expected business opportunities, assumptions underlying estimates of expected cost savings
may be inaccurate, or general industry and business conditions may deteriorate. In addition, integrating operations
will require significant efforts and expenses on our part. Personnel may leave or be terminated because of an
acquisition. Our management may have its attention diverted while trying to integrate an acquisition. If these factors
limit our ability to integrate the operations of an acquisition successfully or on a timely basis, our expectations of
future results of operations, including certain cost savings and synergies as a result of the acquisition, may not be
met. In addition, our growth and operating strategies for a target’s business may be different from the strategies that
the target company pursued prior to our acquisition. If our strategies are not the proper strategies, it could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our ability to generate revenue depends in large part on referrals from physicians._**

A significant reduction in physician referrals would have a negative impact on our business. We derive substantially
all of our net revenue, directly or indirectly, from fees charged for the diagnostic imaging and oncology services
performed at our centers. We depend on referrals of patients from unaffiliated physicians and other third parties who
have no contractual obligations to refer patients to us for a substantial portion of the services we perform. If a
sufficiently large number of these physicians and other third parties were to discontinue referring patients to us,
including in connection with voluntary or involuntary closures of physician offices in connection with the current,
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or the delay of other elective procedures for which our imaging services are required,
our scan volume could decrease, which would reduce our net revenue and operating margins. Further, commercial
third-party payors have implemented programs that could limit the ability of physicians to refer patients to us. For
example, prepaid healthcare plans, such as health maintenance organizations, sometimes contract directly with
providers and require their enrollees to obtain these services exclusively from those providers. Some insurance
companies and self-insured employers also limit these services to contracted providers. These “closed panel”
systems are now common in the managed care environment. Other systems create an economic disincentive for
referrals to providers outside the system’s designated panel of providers. If we are unable to compete successfully
for these managed care contracts, our results and prospects for growth could be adversely affected.

**_Pressure to control healthcare costs could have a negative impact on our results._**

One of the principal objectives of health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations is to
control the cost of healthcare services. Healthcare providers participating in managed care plans may be required to
refer diagnostic imaging tests or oncology services to certain providers depending on the plan in which a covered
patient is enrolled. In addition, managed care contracting has become very competitive, and reimbursement
schedules are at or below Medicare reimbursement levels. The expansion of health maintenance organizations,
preferred provider organizations and other managed care organizations within the geographic areas covered by our
network could have a negative impact on the utilization and pricing of our services, because these organizations will
exert greater control over patients’ access to diagnostic imaging services, the selections of the provider of such
services and reimbursement rates for those services.

**_If our contracted radiology practices lose a significant number of radiologists, our financial results could be_**
**_adversely affected._**

At times, there has been a shortage of qualified radiologists in some of the regional markets we serve. In addition,
competition in recruiting radiologists may make it difficult for our contracted radiology practices to maintain
adequate levels of radiologists. If a significant number of radiologists terminate their relationships with our
contracted radiology practices and those radiology practices cannot recruit sufficient qualified radiologists to fulfill
their obligations under our agreements with them, our ability to maximize the use of our outpatient diagnostic
imaging and oncology centers and our financial results could be adversely affected. Neither we, nor our contracted
radiology practices, maintain insurance on the lives of any affiliated physicians.

**_We may become subject to professional malpractice liability, which could be costly and negatively impact our_**
**_business._**

Our facilities and the physicians employed by our contracted radiology practices are from time to time subject to
malpractice claims. We structure our relationships with radiologists in a manner that we believe does not constitute
the practice of medicine by us or subject us to professional malpractice claims for acts or omissions of physicians
employed by the contracted radiology practices. Nevertheless, claims, suits or complaints relating to services
provided by the contracted radiology practices have been asserted against us in the past and may be asserted against
us in the future. In addition, we may be subject to professional liability claims, including, without limitation, for
improper use or malfunction of our outpatient diagnostic imaging equipment or for accidental contamination or
injury from exposure to radiation. We may not be able to maintain adequate liability insurance to protect us against
those claims at acceptable costs or at all.

Any claim made against us that is not fully covered by insurance could be costly to defend, result in a substantial
damage award against us and divert the attention of our management from our operations, all of which could have
an adverse effect on our financial performance. In addition, successful claims against us may adversely affect our
business or reputation.

**_We may not be able to enforce claims with respect to the representations, warranties and indemnities that the_**
**_sellers of any diagnostic imaging or oncology center we acquire have provided to us under the respective_**
**_purchase agreements._**

In connection with our acquisitions, the sellers have given certain representations, warranties and indemnities. There
can be no assurance that we will be able to enforce any claims against those sellers’ breaches of such
representations, warranties or indemnities. The sellers’ liability with respect to breaches of such representations and
warranties and indemnities under the respective purchase agreement may be limited or the amount and coverage of
any insurance obtained with respect to representations and warranties may be limited. Even if we ultimately succeed
in recovering any amounts, we may temporarily be required to bear these losses ourselves.

**_We may not be able to secure additional financing which may impair our ability to complete future acquisitions._**

There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise the additional funding that we will need to carry out our
business objectives and to complete outpatient diagnostic imaging or oncology center acquisitions and we may be
limited to obtain financing under the terms of the Financing from Stonepeak. The development of our business
depends upon prevailing capital market conditions, our business performance and our ability to obtain financing
through debt financing, equity financing or other means. There is no assurance that we will be successful in
obtaining the financing we require as and when needed or at all in order to complete future acquisitions.

**_We do not independently own all of our outpatient diagnostic imaging or oncology centers._**

Healthcare laws and regulations in the United States may impact our ability to operate or own our outpatient
diagnostic imaging or oncology centers, thereby necessitating the use of partnerships, joint ventures and other
management services frameworks. We may be required to deal with such diverse operating or ownership
frameworks. In addition, from time to time, we may decide to use cash to restructure our arrangements with fellow
owners, managers or operators.

**_High fuel costs can harm our operations and financial performance._**

Fuel costs constitute a significant portion of Alliance’s mobile operating expenses, through diesel fuel for Alliance’s
tractor-trailer fleet and mileage reimbursement for its team members. Historically, fuel costs have been subject to wide
price fluctuations based on geopolitical issues and supply and demand. Fuel availability is also affected by demand
for home heating oil, diesel, gasoline and other petroleum products, as well as overall economic conditions. Because
of the effect of these events on the price and availability of fuel, we cannot predict the cost and future availability of
fuel with any degree of certainty. In the event of a fuel supply shortage or further increases in fuel prices, we might
be forced to curtail Alliance’s scheduled mobile services. Sustained high fuel costs will harm our financial condition
and results of operations.


-----

**_Insurance costs and claims expenses could adversely affect our earnings._**

The transportation aspect of Alliance’s business is exposed to costs for property damage claims by others; personal
injury; damage to our mobile systems resulting from accidents, vandalism or theft; and workers’ compensation.
Alliance carries insurance to minimize these exposures. Insurance costs have varied over the past five years, reflecting
the level of Alliance’s operations, the insurance environment for its industry, its claim experience and its self-retained
(deductible) level.

We are also responsible for claim expenses within our self-retained (deductible) levels for liability and workers’
compensation claims. Alliance maintains insurance to cover claims and expense in excess of deductible levels with
insurance companies that Alliance considers financially sound. Although Alliance believes its aggregate insurance
limits are sufficient to cover reasonably expected claims, it is possible that one or more claims could exceed those
limits and adversely affect our operating results. If the number or severity of claims within our deductible levels
increases, or if we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because the claims prove to be more severe than
our original assessment, our operating results would be adversely affected.

**_Alliance’s transportation operations are regulated, and failure to comply or increased costs of compliance with_**
**_existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business._**

The transportation aspect of Alliance’s business is subject to legislative and regulatory changes that can affect our
operations and financial performance. Alliance’s trucking operations and those of the trucking companies and
independent contractors with whom Alliance engages are subject to regulation by the Department of Transportation
(the “DOT”), and various state, local, and foreign governmental agencies, which govern activities such as
authorization to engage in motor carrier operations, handling of hazardous materials, safety ratings, insurance
requirements, vehicle weight and size, and emissions restrictions. Alliance is also periodically audited by the DOT
and other state and federal authorities to ensure that Alliance complies with safety, required licenses, hours-of-service,
clean truck regulations, and other rules and regulations.

New governmental laws and regulations, or changes to existing laws and regulations, could affect Alliance’s
transportation operations. Any additional measures that may be required by future laws and regulations or changes to
existing laws and regulations may require us to make changes to Alliance’s operating practices and may result in
additional costs. If we are unable to pass such costs through to our clients, this could have an adverse effect on our
financial performance.

**_We may engage in litigation with our partners and contractors._**

The nature of our relationships with our partners and contractors may give rise to litigation or disputes. In the
ordinary course of business, we are the subject of complaints or litigation. We may also engage in future litigation to
enforce the terms of our agreements and compliance with our brand standards as determined necessary to protect our
brand, the consistency of our services and the consumer experience. Engaging in such litigation may be costly and
time-consuming and may distract management and materially adversely affect our relationships with our partners
and contractors or potential partners and contractors and our ability to attract new partners and contractors. Any
negative outcome of these or any other claims could materially adversely affect our results of operations, as well as
our ability to increase our number of partners and contractors and may damage our reputation and brand.
Furthermore, existing and future legislation could subject us to additional litigation risk in the event we are required
by such legislation to terminate or fail to renew a partner or contractor or not succeed in revising the contracts
related to such relationships to comply with changes to legislation.

**_The regulatory framework in which we operate is uncertain and evolving._**

Healthcare laws and regulations may change significantly in the future. We continuously monitor these
developments and modify our operations from time to time as the regulatory environment changes. We cannot
assure you, however, that we will be able to adapt our operations to address new regulations or that new regulations
will not adversely affect our business. Although we believe that we are operating in compliance with applicable
federal and state laws, we cannot assure you that a review of our business by courts or regulatory authorities will not
result in a determination that could adversely affect our operations or that the healthcare regulatory environment will
not change in a way that restricts our operations. Certain states have enacted statutes or adopted regulations affecting


-----

risk assumption in the healthcare industry, including statutes and regulations that subject any physician or physician
network engaged in risk-based managed care contracting to applicable insurance laws and regulations. These laws
and regulations, if adopted in the states in which we operate, may require physicians and physician networks to meet
minimum capital requirements and other safety and soundness requirements. Implementing additional regulations or
compliance requirements could result in substantial costs to us and the contracted radiology practices and limit our
ability to enter into risk-sharing managed care arrangements.

**_Failure to structure our operations in compliance with federal and state regulations, including anti-kickback,_**
**_self-referral, false claims or other fraud and abuse laws, could result in substantial penalties._**

We are directly or indirectly through the radiology practices with which we contract subject to extensive regulation
by both the federal government and the state governments in which we and/or they provide services. These laws
may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we conduct our operations,
including our sales and marketing practices with referring physicians, our joint ventures with hospitals and
physicians, and our contractual arrangements with hospitals, physicians and radiologists. Such laws include, without
limitation:

    - the U.S. federal civil and criminal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons
or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing any remuneration,
directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either
the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good, facility,
item or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under U.S. federal and state
healthcare programs such as Medicare, state Medicaid programs and TRICARE. A person or entity
does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have
committed a violation;

    - the federal physician self-referral prohibition, commonly known as the Stark Law, which, in the
absence of an applicable exception, prohibits a physician from making a referral for certain designated
health services covered by the Medicare or Medicaid program, including diagnostic imaging and
oncology services, if the physician or an immediate family member of the physician has a financial
relationship with the entity providing the designated health services. The Stark Law also prohibits the
entity furnishing the designated health services from billing, presenting or causing to be presented a
claim for the designated health services furnished pursuant to the prohibited referral;

    - the federal false claims laws, including the False Claims Act, which can be enforced through
whistleblower actions, and civil monetary penalties laws, which, among other things, impose criminal
and civil penalties against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented,
to the U.S. federal government, claims for payment or approval that are false or fraudulent, knowingly
making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or
fraudulent claim, or from knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an
obligation to pay money to the U.S. federal government. In addition, the government may assert that a
claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute
or the Stark Law constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act; Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil
liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a
scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or
covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement, in connection with the delivery
of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback
Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to
violate it in order to have committed a violation;

    - HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or
HITECH, and its implementing regulations, which also imposes certain obligations, including
mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of
individually identifiable health information by covered entities, such as health plans, healthcare


-----

clearinghouses and healthcare providers, as well as their business associates that perform certain
services involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information;

    - state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, including state anti-kickback, self-referral and
false claims laws that apply more broadly to healthcare items or services paid by all payors, including
self-pay patients and private insurers, that govern our interactions with patients or restrict payments
that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources;

    - state laws that prohibit the practice of medicine by non-physicians and prohibit fee-splitting
arrangements involving physicians;

    - laws relating to facility, practitioner and provider licensure;

    - laws relating to medical malpractice;

    - federal and state billing and claims submission and other insurance laws and regulations;

    - federal and state laws governing the diagnostic imaging and therapeutic equipment we use in our
business concerning patient safety, equipment operating specifications and radiation exposure levels;
and

    - state laws governing reimbursement for diagnostic services related to services compensable under
worker’s compensation rules.

Our sales and marketing practices with physicians and other financial relationships within the Akumin organization,
including amounts paid under our management services agreements, interpretation services agreements, joint
venture agreements and sub-lease agreements between Alliance and physicians or physician groups and all other
financial arrangements involving Akumin, its intermediaries and potential referral sources or recipients may,
notwithstanding our policies and procedures otherwise, result in violations of these laws. Our financial
arrangements and our sales and marketing practice have been subject to regulatory scrutiny in the past and could be
in the future. We may be subject to private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers on behalf of the
federal or state governments, with potential liability under the federal False Claims Act, including mandatory treble
damages and significant per-claim penalties. While our management services agreements, services agreements and
operational policies and procedures, including our compliance program, mandate compliance with applicable law,
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in preventing our managed practices, contractors, employees or
other agents from taking actions in violation of these laws or regulations or that we will not otherwise be deemed to
have failed to comply with such laws.

If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws and regulations to which we or the radiology
practices with which we contract are subject, we may be subject to the applicable penalty associated with the
violation, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines and the curtailment of our operations. Any penalties,
damages, fines or curtailment of our operations, individually or in the aggregate, could adversely affect our ability to
operate our business and our financial results. The risks of our being found in violation of these laws and regulations
is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts,
their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations and such laws and regulations may apply to businesses
acquired from time to time by Akumin, in addition to Akumin’s business.

**_If the structures or operations of our joint ventures and arrangements with hospitals and physician practices are_**
**_found to violate the law, it could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and consolidated_**
**_results of operations._**

We have a variety of financial relationships with hospitals and physicians, including joint ventures and providerbased “under arrangements”, which are governed by the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark Law and similar
state laws. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits the payment or receipt of anything of value in return for
referrals of patients or services covered by governmental health care programs, such as Medicare. The OIG has
published numerous safe harbors that exempt qualifying arrangements from enforcement under the federal AntiKickback Statute. While we endeavor to comply with applicable safe harbors, certain of our arrangements, including


-----

our joint ventures and financial relationships with physicians, hospitals and other referral sources, do not qualify for
safe harbor protection. In addition, our financial relationship with referring physicians and their immediate family
members must comply with the Stark Law by meeting an exception. Unlike the Anti-Kickback Statute, failure to
meet an exception under the Stark Law results in a violation of the Stark Law, even if such violation is technical in
nature. Both the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the Stark Law and their implementing regulations are detailed
and complex and are subject to continuing legal and regulatory changes. While we believe our arrangements with
physicians, hospitals and other referral sources have been structured to comply with the federal Anti-Kickback
Statute, the Stark Law and similar state laws, there can be no assurance that regulatory authorities enforcing these
laws will determine these financial arrangements comply with applicable law.

If any of our contractual arrangements and joint ventures were found to be in violation of federal or state antikickback or physician referral laws, we could be required to restructure them or refuse to accept referrals from the
physicians or hospitals with which we have entered into a joint venture. We also could be required to repay to
Medicare amounts we have received pursuant to any prohibited referrals, and we could suffer civil or criminal
penalties, including the loss of our licenses to operate and our ability to participate in federal and state health care
programs. If any of our contractual arrangements and joint ventures were subject to any of these penalties, our
business could be materially adversely affected. If the structure of any of our contractual arrangements and joint
ventures were found to violate federal or state anti-kickback statutes or physician referral laws, we may be unable to
implement our growth strategy, which could have an adverse impact on our future net income and consolidated
results of operations

**_We could be subject to increased monetary penalties and other sanctions, including exclusion from federal_**
**_healthcare programs, if we fail to comply with the terms of applicable corporate integrity agreements._**

Prior to our acquisition of Preferred Medical Imaging, LLC (“Akumin Texas”), Preferred Imaging Centers, LLC
(“PIC”), then a wholly-owned subsidiary of Akumin Texas which was merged into Akumin Texas effective
September 30, 2017, was the subject of an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) premised
upon an allegation that PIC and its affiliates violated U.S. federal law by performing and billing for certain imaging
services without on-site physician supervision. In or about June, 2016, PIC entered into a no-fault settlement
agreement with the DOJ with respect to those allegations, which included PIC paying $3.5 million to the
U.S. government and entering into a corporate integrity agreement (“CIA”) with the Office of the Inspector General
for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“OIG”). PIC’s CIA expired June 29, 2021, and PIC is
completing its reporting with respect to the final year of that CIA.

Material, uncorrected violations of the CIA could lead to our exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid
and other federal and state healthcare programs. In addition, we are subject to possible civil penalties for failure to
substantially comply with the terms of the CIA, including stipulated penalties ranging between $1,000 and $2,500
per day. We are also subject to a stipulated penalty of $50,000 for each false certification made by us or on our
behalf, pursuant to the reporting provisions of the CIA. The CIA increases the amount of information we must
provide to the federal government regarding our practices at our healthcare facilities and our compliance with
federal regulations. The reports we provide in connection with the CIA could result in greater scrutiny by other
regulatory agencies.

Given the broad powers of the DOJ and other federal agencies, there can be no assurance that the obligations of
Akumin Texas pursuant to its CIA, or otherwise, will not be expanded to cover all or a greater portion of Akumin’s
operations. Any action brought against us for violation of these laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend
against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, suffer reputational harm and divert our management’s
attention from the operation of our business.

**_We may from time to time become the subject of legal, regulatory and governmental proceedings that, if resolved_**
**_unfavorably, could have an adverse effect on us, and we may be subject to other loss contingencies, both known_**
**_and unknown._**

We may from time to time become a party to various legal, regulatory and governmental proceedings and other
related matters. Those proceedings include, among other things, governmental investigations and lawsuits brought
against us by third parties. In addition, we may become subject to other loss contingencies, both known and


-----

unknown, which may relate to past, present and future facts, events, circumstances and occurrences. Addressing any
investigations, lawsuits or other claims may distract management and divert resources, even if we ultimately prevail.
Should an unfavorable outcome occur in some or all of any such current or future legal, regulatory or governmental
proceedings or other such loss contingencies, or if successful claims and other actions are brought against us in the
future, there could be an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

The healthcare industry has seen numerous ongoing investigations related to compliance, supervision and billing
practices. From time to time, we detect issues of non-compliance with federal healthcare laws pertaining to claims
submission and reimbursement payment practices, including compliance with supervision requirements, or financial
relationships with physicians. We avail ourselves of various mechanisms to address potential overpayments arising
out of these issues, including repayment of claims, rebilling of claims, and participation in voluntary disclosure
protocols offered by Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) and the OIG. Under the federal False
Claims Act, private parties have the right to bring qui tam, or “whistleblower,” suits against healthcare facilities that
submit false claims for payments to, or improperly retain overpayments from, governmental payors. Some states
have adopted similar state whistleblower and false claims provisions. Qui tam or “whistleblower” actions initiated
under the civil False Claims Act may be pending but placed under seal by the court to comply with the False Claims
Act’s requirements for filing such suits. As a result, they could lead to proceedings without our knowledge. Certain
of our, and Alliance’s, facilities and radiology practices have received and may receive, inquiries, civil investigative
demands, or subpoenas from federal and state agencies. Governmental investigations, as well as qui tam lawsuits,
may lead to significant fines, penalties, settlements or other sanctions, including exclusion from federal and state
healthcare programs. We are and have been subject to civil investigative demands and investigations from time to
time regarding our compliance with physician supervision requirements for MRI procedures and other diagnostic
imaging tests, as well as our sales and marketing practices and financial arrangements with physicians. Settlements
of lawsuits involving Medicare and Medicaid issues routinely require both monetary payments and corporate
integrity agreements, each of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial
position and cash flows.

**_Federal and state privacy and information security laws are complex, and if we fail to comply with applicable_**
**_laws, regulations and standards, or if we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data, protect our_**
**_proprietary rights to our systems, or defend against cybersecurity attacks, we may be subject to government or_**
**_private actions due to privacy and security breaches, and our business, reputation, results of operations, financial_**
**_position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected._**

We must comply with numerous federal and state laws and regulations governing the collection, dissemination,
access, use, security and privacy of personally identifiable information and protected health information, including
HIPAA, state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, federal and state consumer
protection laws and regulations and other data protection laws. New privacy legislation may create additional rights
for consumers and impose additional requirements on businesses. As these laws and regulations increase in
complexity and number, they may change frequently, sometimes conflict and increase our compliance efforts, costs
and risks. If we fail to comply with applicable privacy and security laws, regulations and standards, properly
maintain the integrity of our data, protect our proprietary rights to our systems, or defend against cybersecurity
attacks, our business, reputation, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and
adversely affected.

HIPAA establishes a set of national privacy and security standards for the protection of protected health information,
or PHI, by health plans, health care clearinghouses and certain health care providers, or “covered entities,” and their
“business associates,” which are persons or entities that perform certain services for, or on behalf of, a covered
entity that involve creating, receiving, maintaining or transmitting PHI. We are a covered entity under HIPAA and
therefore must comply with its requirements to protect the privacy and security of health information and must
provide individuals with certain rights with respect to their health information. If we engage a business associate to
assist us in carrying out our health care operations, we must have a written business associate contract or other
arrangement with the business associate that establishes specifically what the business associate has been engaged to
do and requires the business associate to comply with the same requirements.

Penalties for violations of these laws vary. For instance, a single breach incident can result in findings of violations
of multiple HIPAA provisions. Penalties for failure to comply with a requirement of HIPAA vary significantly, and
include civil monetary penalties for each provision of HIPAA that is violated and, in certain circumstances, criminal


-----

penalties, including imprisonment and/or additional fines. A person who knowingly obtains or discloses individually
identifiable health information in violation of HIPAA may face additional fines and up to one-year imprisonment.
The criminal penalties increase if the wrongful conduct involves false pretenses or the intent to sell, transfer, or use
identifiable health information for commercial advantage, personal gain, or malicious harm. We have from time to
time been subject to investigations by the Office for Civil Rights with respect to our HIPAA compliance.
Responding to government investigations regarding alleged violations of these and other laws and regulations, even
if ultimately concluded with no findings of violations or no penalties imposed, can consume company resources and
impact our business and, if public, harm our reputation. State attorneys general also have the right to prosecute
HIPAA violations committed against residents of their states. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action
that would allow individuals to sue in civil court for HIPAA violations, its standards have been used as the basis for
the duty of care in state civil suits, such as those for negligence or recklessness in misusing individuals’ health
information.

Even when HIPAA does not apply, according to the Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, failing to take
appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure may constitute unfair acts or practices in or
affecting commerce in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act (the “FTC Act”). The FTC expects a
company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of
consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve
security and reduce vulnerabilities. Individually identifiable health information is considered sensitive data that
merits stronger safeguards.

Certain states have also adopted comparable privacy and security laws and regulations, some of which may be more
stringent than HIPAA. Such laws and regulations will be subject to interpretation by various courts and other
governmental authorities, thus creating potentially complex compliance issues for us. Further, California enacted the
California Consumer Privacy Act, or the CCPA, on June 28, 2018, which went into effect on January 1, 2020. The
CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain
personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The
CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected
to increase data breach litigation. Although there are limited exemptions for health-related information, including
PHI maintained by a covered entity or a business associate, the CCPA may increase our compliance costs and
potential liability. Some observers have noted that the CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more
stringent privacy legislation in the United States, which could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our
business. Similar laws have been proposed in other states and at the federal level, and if passed, such laws may have
potentially conflicting requirements that would make compliance challenging. Further, the California Privacy Rights
Act (the “CPRA”), recently passed in California. The CPRA will impose additional data protection obligations on
covered businesses, including additional consumer rights processes, limitations on data uses, new audit requirements
for higher risk data, and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It will also create a new California data protection
agency authorized to issue substantive regulations and could result in increased privacy and information security
enforcement. The majority of the provisions will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and additional compliance
investment and potential business process changes may be required.

Compliance with applicable data privacy and security laws, rules and regulations could require us to engage in
costly compliance exercises, restrict our ability to collect, or use and disclose data. Each of these constantly evolving
laws can be subject to varying interpretations. Failure to comply with U.S. data protection laws and regulations
could result in government investigations and enforcement actions (which could include civil or criminal penalties),
fines, private litigation, and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business.
Moreover, patients about whom we obtain information may contractually limit our ability to use and disclose the
information. Claims that we have violated individuals’ privacy rights, failed to comply with data protection laws, or
breached our contractual obligations, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time-consuming to
defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business.

**_Our internal computer systems, or those used by any of our third-party service providers, may fail or suffer_**
**_security breaches, which may adversely affect our business, operations and financial performance._**

Information security risks have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new
technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct our operations, and the
increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists and other external parties, including


-----

foreign state agents. Our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential,
proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks.

Despite the implementation of security measures, our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party service
providers may be vulnerable to privacy and security incidents, cyberattacks, acts of vandalism or theft, computer
viruses, coordinated attacks by activist entities, emerging cybersecurity risks, misplaced or lost data, programming
and/or human errors, or other similar events that could result in unauthorized access to, use or disclosure of,
corruption of, or loss of sensitive and/or proprietary data, including personal information or PHI. Emerging and
advanced security threats, including coordinated attacks, require additional layers of security which may disrupt or
impact efficiency of operations. Attacks upon information technology systems are increasing in their frequency,
levels of persistence, sophistication and intensity, and are being conducted by sophisticated and organized groups
and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may also
face increased cybersecurity risks due to our reliance on internet technology and the number of our employees who
are working remotely, which may create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities.
Furthermore, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or to sabotage, systems change
frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these
techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. We may also experience security breaches that may
remain undetected for an extended period. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it
could result in a material disruption of our business operations. In addition, such a breach may require notification to
governmental agencies, the media or individuals pursuant to various federal and state privacy and security laws, if
applicable, including HIPAA, as well as regulations promulgated by the FTC and state breach notification laws. We
would also be exposed to a risk of loss, including financial assets or litigation and potential liability, which could
materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. To the extent that
any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate
disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability.

Our insurance policies may not be adequate to compensate us for the potential losses arising from such disruptions,
failure, or security breach. In addition, such insurance may not be available to us in the future on economically
reasonable terms, or at all. Further, our insurance may not cover all claims made against us and defending a suit,
regardless of its merit, could be costly, divert management attention, and harm our reputation.

**_We may not receive payment from some of our healthcare provider customers because of their financial_**
**_circumstances or other contractual or legal disputes._**

Some of our healthcare provider customers do not have significant financial resources, liquidity or access to capital.
If these customers experience financial difficulties or if there arises a contractual or other legal dispute to which they
are party, they may be unable to pay us for the equipment and services that we provide. A significant deterioration in
general or local economic conditions, including in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material
adverse effect on the financial health of certain of our healthcare provider customers. As a result, we may have to
increase the amounts of accounts receivable that we write-off, which would adversely affect our financial condition
and results of operations.

**_We have significant liabilities which require us to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in order to_**
**_make mandated payments of principal and interest._**

We have incurred significant liabilities in connection with the Acquisition and the acquisition of our current medical
imaging centers. Our ability to repay these liabilities will be contingent upon our success in achieving sufficient
revenues from these medical imaging centers and the Alliance business to be able to make payments of principal and
interest against this debt when due and payable. There is no assurance that we will be able to secure future additional
financing to repay our current credit facilities should cash flows from operations be insufficient to repay these
liabilities. Our inability to repay outstanding debt when due would have a material adverse impact on our business.

**_We face liquidity risks and may encounter difficulty raising funds to meet our financial commitments._**

We are exposed to liquidity risk mainly with respect to our credit facilities. Although we seek to ensure that there is
sufficient liquidity to meet our short-term business requirements, taking into account our anticipated cash flows
from operations and our holdings of cash, there is no assurance sufficient liquidity is maintained. If our actual cash


-----

flows from operations differ significantly from our anticipated cash flows for these purposes, such as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic, we may have insufficient liquidity to meet our financial commitments.

**_The effect of the uncertainty relating to potential future changes to U.S. healthcare laws may increase our and_**
**_our partners’ and contractors’ healthcare costs, limit the ability of patients to obtain health insurance, increase_**
**_patients’ share of health care costs and negatively impact our financial results._**

Healthcare systems are subject to ongoing legislative and regulatory reform in the United States and abroad, and
certain of these proposals may affect reimbursement, coverage, and utilization of diagnostic imaging and oncology
services. For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and
Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “ACA”) was signed into law, which substantially changed
the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States.

Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional efforts to modify or repeal the ACA. For example,
the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision that entered into effect on January 1, 2019, that repealed the
tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying
health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” In December
2018, a U.S. district court held that the individual mandate was unconstitutional, which was upheld by the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the case without
specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act.

In addition, there have been other legislative changes proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was
enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, resulted in reductions in payments to
Medicare providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative
amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from
May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021, unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, the
American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced CMS payments to several providers, including
hospitals, further increased the presumed utilization of advanced diagnostic imaging and oncology services to a
presumed rate of 90%, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover Medicare
overpayments to providers from three to five years.

Furthermore, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which hospitals and
other healthcare providers set their charges, which has resulted in proposed and enacted regulations designed to
bring transparency to charges and reduce the cost of products and services. The failure to comply with transparency
laws can result in significant penalties.

We cannot predict which healthcare reform measures will be implemented or the full impact of current or future
healthcare reform measures on our business. While we are unable to predict what, if any, changes may ultimately be
enacted, the U.S. Congressional Budget Office and others have estimated that some of the proposals made to date
would result in millions of additional uninsured patients in the U.S. Additionally, U.S. lawmakers have suggested
that, even if no formal legislation repealing or modifying the ACA is passed, they may take, or omit, actions that
could adversely impact the viability of the ACA and the health insurance markets, which could result in more
uninsured patients, other patients having lesser coverage or patients having to absorb a greater portion of the cost of
their health care services. Any such changes or any other future changes in the manner in which health care services
in the U.S. are paid for and reimbursed by government and private payors could adversely impact our business.

**_Because of our U.S. operations, we could be adversely affected by violations of anti-bribery laws._**

Almost all of our operations are located outside of Canada. Anti-bribery laws and regulations generally prohibit
companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-resident officers, employees or any
other persons acting in an official capacity for any government entity to any political party or official thereof or to
any candidate for political office for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our management services
agreements, services agreements and operational policies and procedures, including our compliance program,
mandate compliance with applicable law, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in preventing our
contractors, employees or other agents from taking actions in violation of these laws or regulations or that we will
not otherwise be deemed to have failed to comply with such laws. Such violations, or allegations of such violations,


-----

could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and
cash flows.

**_We operate outpatient diagnostic imaging and oncology centers in some regions which are exposed to natural_**
**_disasters, public health epidemics and other calamities._**

Our outpatient diagnostic imaging and oncology centers are located in regions which are vulnerable to a variety of
natural disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes, flooding, wild fires, etc. We cannot ensure that our centers in
these markets would survive a future hurricane, earthquake, flood, wild fire or other natural disaster. Similarly, we
cannot ensure that we will be able to procure insurance for such losses in meaningful amounts or at affordable rates
in the future. If a natural disaster or other event with a significant economic impact occurs in a region where we
operate, such disaster or event could negatively affect the profitability of our business. A local, regional, national or
international outbreak of a contagious disease, including the novel coronavirus known as COVID-19, Middle East
Respiratory Syndrome, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, H1N1 influenza virus, avian flu or any other similar
illness, or a fear of any of the foregoing, and changes to laws and other government actions implemented in response
to such an illness, could decrease the willingness or ability of customers to patronize our centers, cause shortages of
employees to staff our centers, interrupt certain supplies from third parties upon which we rely, restrict our ability to
offer certain services and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. Such adverse effect could be rapid and unexpected and it is unknown whether and how we may be
affected if such an epidemic persists for an extended period of time.

**_We may be unsuccessful in evaluating material risks involved in completed and future investments which could_**
**_impact our ability to realize the expected benefits from future investments and acquisitions._**

We regularly review investment opportunities and, as part of the review, conduct business, legal and financial due
diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in any particular transaction. Despite
our efforts, we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks. In particular, financial insight into
our previously acquired companies or financial due diligence in respect of potential targets may be limited in light of
the availability of financial information. As a result, we may not realize the intended advantages of any given
investment and may not identify all of the risks relating to the investment. If we fail to realize the expected benefits
from one or more investments, or do not identify all of the risks associated with a particular investment, our
business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.

**_We may be subject to certain regulations that could restrict our activities and abilities to generate revenues as_**
**_planned._**

From time to time, governments, government agencies and industry self-regulatory bodies in Canada, the United
States, and other countries in which we will operate have adopted statutes, regulations and rulings that directly or
indirectly affect the activities of our company and our future clients. These regulations could adversely impact on
our ability to execute our business strategy and generate revenues as planned.

**_Technological change in our industry could reduce the demand for our services and require us to incur_**
**_significant costs to upgrade our equipment._**

The development of new technologies or refinements of existing modalities may require us to upgrade and enhance
our existing equipment before we may otherwise intend. Many companies currently manufacture diagnostic imaging
equipment. Competition among manufacturers for a greater share of the diagnostic imaging equipment market may
result in technological advances in the speed and imaging capacity of new equipment. This may accelerate the
obsolescence of our equipment, and we may not have the financial ability to acquire the new or improved equipment
and may not be able to maintain a competitive equipment base. In addition, advances in technology may enable
physicians and others to perform diagnostic imaging procedures without us. If we are unable to deliver our services
in the efficient and effective manner that payors, physicians and patients expect, our revenue could substantially
decrease.


-----

**_Because we have high fixed costs, lower scan volumes per system could adversely affect our business._**

The principal components of our expenses, excluding depreciation, consist of debt service, finance lease payments,
compensation paid to technologists, salaries, real estate lease expenses and equipment maintenance costs. Because a
majority of these expenses are fixed, a relatively small change in our revenue could have a disproportionate effect on
our operating and financial results depending on the source of our revenue. Thus, decreased revenue as a result of
lower scan volumes per system could result in lower margins, which could materially adversely affect our business.

**_We may be unable to effectively maintain our equipment or generate revenue when our equipment is not_**
**_operational._**

Timely, effective service is essential to maintaining our reputation and high use rates on our imaging equipment.
Although we have an agreement with a third party equipment service provider pursuant to which such service
provider maintains and repairs the majority of our imaging equipment, the agreement does not compensate us for
loss of revenue when our systems are not fully operational and our business interruption insurance may not provide
sufficient coverage for the loss of revenue. Also, third party equipment service providers may not be able to perform
repairs or supply needed parts in a timely manner, which could result in a loss of revenue. Therefore, if we
experience more equipment malfunctions than anticipated or if we are unable to promptly obtain the service
necessary to keep our equipment functioning effectively, or where our business or data is compromised on account
of equipment malfunctions or a cybersecurity-related attack, our ability to provide services and to fulfill our
contractual arrangements would be adversely affected and our revenue could decline.

**_Our inability to attract and retain qualified radiology technologists and key managerial and other non-medical_**
**_personnel may adversely impact our ability to carry out our business operations and strategies as planned._**

We are highly dependent on qualified managerial personnel. Our anticipated growth will require additional expertise
and the addition of new qualified personnel. There is intense competition for qualified personnel in the radiology
and medical imaging field. Therefore, we may not be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for
the development of our business. The loss of the services of existing personnel, as well as the failure to recruit
additional key managerial personnel in a timely manner, would harm our business development programs and ability
to manage day-to-day operations, attract collaboration partners, attract and retain other employees and generate
revenues. We may not maintain key personal life insurance on any of our employees.

**_Our policies regarding allowances for doubtful accounts may negatively impact our financial results in future_**
**_fiscal periods._**

We cannot ensure that our allowances for doubtful accounts will not exceed the estimates, which could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.

**_Market rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations._**

We may be subject to market risk through the risk of loss of value in our portfolios resulting from changes in interest
rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, and equity prices. We are required to mark to market our
held-for-trading investments at the end of each reporting period, to the extent we own any such investments. This
process could result in significant write-downs of our investments over one or more reporting periods, particularly
during periods of overall market instability, including the extreme market volatility in connection with the current
COVID-19 pandemic, which could have a significant unfavorable effect on our financial position.

**_Some of our imaging modalities use radioactive materials which generate regulated waste and could subject us to_**
**_liabilities for injuries or violations of environmental and health and safety laws._**

Some of our imaging procedures use radioactive materials which generate medical and other regulated wastes. For
example, patients are injected with a radioactive substance before undergoing a PET scan. Storage, use and disposal
of these materials and waste products present the risk of accidental environmental contamination and physical
injury. We are subject to federal, state and local regulations governing storage, handling and disposal of these
materials. We could incur significant costs and the diversion of our management’s attention in order to comply with
current or future environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. Also, we cannot completely eliminate


-----

the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these hazardous materials. Although we believe that we maintain
liability insurance coverage consistent with industry practice in the event of an accident, we could be held liable for
any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed the limits of or fall outside the coverage of our liability
insurance.

**_Our inability to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could increase the risk of an error in_**
**_our financial statements._**

Our senior management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial
reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP. Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving
financial reporting objectives due to its inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that
involves human diligence and compliance and is therefore subject to error, collusion, or improper override. Given
such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis, and
although it is possible to incorporate into the financial reporting process safeguards to reduce this risk, they cannot
be guaranteed to entirely eliminate it. If we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, then
there is an increased risk of an error in our financial statements that could result in us being required to restate
previously issued financial statements at a later date.

**_If we fail to comply with various licensure, certification and accreditation standards, we may be subject to loss of_**
**_licensure, certification or accreditation, which would adversely affect our operations._**

Ownership, construction, operation, expansion and acquisition of our outpatient diagnostic imaging and oncology
centers are subject to various federal and state laws, regulations and approvals concerning licensing of personnel,
other required certificates for certain types of healthcare facilities and certain medical equipment. In addition,
freestanding diagnostic imaging centers that provide services independent of a physician’s office must be enrolled
by Medicare as an independent diagnostic treatment facility, or IDTF, to bill the Medicare program. Medicare
carriers have discretion in applying the IDTF requirements and therefore the application of these requirements may
vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In addition, federal legislation requires all suppliers that provide the technical
component of diagnostic MRI, PET/CT, CT, and nuclear medicine to be accredited by an accreditation organization
designated by CMS (as defined below) (which currently includes the American College of Radiology (“ACR”), the
Intersocietal Accreditation Commission, RadSite and the Joint Commission). Our MRI, CT, mammography and
other diagnostic equipment are accredited as necessary by RadSite, ACR, IAC, The Joint Commission or other
recognized accreditation bodies. We may not be able to receive the required regulatory approvals or accreditation for
any future acquisitions, expansions or replacements, and the failure to obtain these approvals could limit the
opportunity to expand our services.

Our centers are subject to periodic inspection by governmental and other authorities to assure continued compliance
with the various standards necessary for licensure and certification. If any facility loses its certification under the
Medicare program, then the facility will be ineligible to receive reimbursement from the Medicare and Medicaid
programs. For Fiscal 2019, approximately 14% of our revenue came from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A
change in the applicable certification status of one of our centers could adversely affect our other centers and in turn
us as a whole.

In addition to licensure and certification at the facility level, the radiologists providing professional medical services
at our facilities are subject to licensing and related regulations by the states in which they provide services. As a
result, we require the radiology groups with which we contract to require those radiologists to have and maintain
appropriate licensure. Further, credentialing of physicians is required by our payors prior to commencing payment.
We have experienced a slowdown in the credentialing of our physicians over the last several years which has
lengthened our billing and collection cycle and could negatively impact our ability to collect revenue from patients
covered by Medicare.


-----

**_Our management services arrangements with radiology practices and our professional services agreements with_**
**_contracted radiologists or radiology practices must be structured in compliance with laws relating to the practice_**
**_of medicine, including, without limitation, fee-splitting prohibitions._**

State laws in certain of the states in which we operate prohibit us from owning radiology practices, from exercising
control over the clinical judgment of physicians and/or from engaging in certain financial arrangements, such as
splitting professional fees with physicians. These laws vary by state and are enforced by state courts and regulatory
authorities, each with broad discretion, and often with limited precedent as to how challenges under these laws may
turn out. A component of our business has been to enter into management services agreements with radiology
practices. We provide management, administrative, technical and other non-medical services to the radiology
practices in exchange for a service fee typically based on a percentage of the practice’s revenue. We structure our
relationships with these radiology practices, including those managed following an acquisition by us of their nonclinical assets, in a manner that we believe keeps us from engaging in the practice of medicine or exercising control
over the medical judgments or decisions of the radiology practices or their physicians, or violating prohibitions
against fee-splitting. There can be no assurance that our present arrangements with physicians providing medical
services and medical supervision at our owned or managed diagnostic imaging and oncology centers will not be
challenged, and, if challenged, that they will not be found to violate applicable laws, thus subjecting us to potential
damages, injunction and/or civil and criminal penalties or require us to restructure our arrangements in a way that
would affect the control or quality of our services and/or change the amounts we receive from the operation of these
centers and locations. Any of these results could jeopardize our business. We have structured the fees payable to our
subsidiaries by our affiliated practice groups in such a manner that we believe complies with applicable federal, state
and local laws. Although the relevant laws have been subject to limited judicial and regulatory interpretation, we
believe that we are in compliance with applicable state laws in relation to the corporate practice of medicine.
However, regulatory authorities or other parties may assert that despite these management arrangements between
our subsidiaries and affiliated physician groups, we or our manager subsidiaries are engaged in the corporate
practice of medicine or that the contractual arrangements with the affiliated physician groups constitute unlawful fee
splitting or another violation of corporate practice of medicine rules. Should such an event occur, we or our
affiliated physician groups could be subject to administrative, civil or criminal remedies or penalties, our
management services contracts could be found to be legally invalid and unenforceable, in whole or in part, or we
could be required to restructure our contractual arrangements with our affiliated physician groups.

**_Recently enacted and future federal legislation, regulatory changes or payment changes implemented by_**
**_commercial payors could limit the prices we can charge for our services and/or the amount we are reimbursed for_**
**_our services, which would reduce our revenue and adversely affect our operating results._**

Our revenue is derived from a diverse mix of third-party payors, including private payors, managed care capitated
payors and government payors. We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from direct billings to governmental
healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and private health insurance companies and/or health plans,
including, but not limited to, those participating in the Medicare Advantage program. For services for which we bill
Medicare directly or indirectly, including through contracted radiologists, we are paid under the Medicare Physician
Fee Schedule. Medicare reimbursement rates are subject to annual updates, which can result in significant
reimbursement cuts and changes to coverage criteria. Changes to Medicare reimbursement rates for outpatient
services provided by our hospital partners can negatively impact the contractual fees that we can charge for our
services. Because governmental healthcare programs generally reimburse on a fee schedule basis rather than on a
charge-related basis, we generally cannot increase our revenues from these programs by increasing the amount of
charges for services. Any negative changes in governmental capitation or fee-for-service rates or methods of
reimbursement for the services we provide could have a significant adverse impact on our revenue and financial
results.

Generally, commercial insurance companies reimburse us, directly or indirectly, including through the contracted
radiology groups elsewhere, on the basis of agreed upon rates. These rates are negotiated and may differ materially
with rates set forth in the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule for the particular service. The patients may be
responsible for certain co-payments or deductibles.

Government and private payors have taken and may continue to take steps to control the cost, eligibility for, use, and
delivery of healthcare services, including diagnostic imaging and oncology services, as a result of budgetary
constraints, cost containment pressures and other reasons. For example, reimbursement by government payors for a


-----

number of diagnostic imaging procedures, including many that we or our managed radiology practices perform, has
been materially reduced over the last number of years. Certain private payors have followed suit and reduced
reimbursement for certain diagnostic imaging procedures. Given the recent history, we expect that reimbursement
for certain diagnostic imaging services that we or our managed radiology practices provide, may be reduced in the
future, which would adversely impact our business. Additionally, CMS and other payors are seeking to shift from a
primarily fee for service reimbursement paradigm to a more value based model. We cannot predict what such
changes will ultimately look like or how they may ultimately impact our business or financial performance, which
creates significant uncertainty for our business.

**_There may be gaps in our insurance coverage relating to events which transpired prior to our acquisition of our_**
**_centers in Pennsylvania and Delaware._**

When we acquired the assets of our centers in Pennsylvania and Delaware on April 21, 2016, we also agreed to
indemnify the physician-owned radiology practices which serviced those centers pursuant to management services
agreements with those entities. We have not insured against risks which pre-date its acquisition of those centers
and, as a result, it could be liable, without the benefit of insurance proceeds, for damages suffered as a result of
complaints or other proceedings against those physician-owned radiology practices relating to events which
transpired prior to April 21, 2016. These complaints could include actions for medical malpractice or wrongful
death.

**_We incur expenses as a result of being a public company and our current resources may not be sufficient to_**
**_fulfill our public company obligations._**

We incur significant legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses as a result of being a public company, which
may negatively impact our performance and could cause our results of operations and financial condition to suffer.
Compliance with applicable securities laws in Canada and the U.S. and the rules of the Toronto Stock Exchange (the
“TSX”) and The Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) substantially increases our expenses, including our legal and
accounting costs, and makes some activities more time-consuming and costly. Reporting obligations as a public
company and our anticipated growth may place a strain on our financial and management systems, processes and
controls, as well as our personnel.

We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, which is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Because of our inherent limitations and the
fact that we are a public company and are implementing additional financial control and management systems,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. A failure to prevent or
detect errors or misstatements may result in a material impact on our financial position, liquidity, and results of
operations.

If our management is unable to certify the effectiveness of our internal controls or if material weaknesses in our
internal controls are identified, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence, which
could have a material impact on our financial position, liquidity, and results of operations. In addition, if we do not
maintain adequate financial and management personnel, processes and controls, we may not be able to accurately
report our financial performance on a timely basis, which could have a material impact on our financial position,
liquidity, and results of operations.

We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting will
prevent all error or fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and implemented, can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control
system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered
relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide
absolute assurance that all control issues within an organization are detected. The inherent limitations include the
realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or
mistakes. Controls can also be circumvented by individual acts of certain persons, by collusion of two or more
people or by management override of the controls. Due to the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system,


-----

misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected in a timely manner or at all. If we cannot
provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results could be materially adversely
effected, which could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which in turn
could have a material impact on our financial position, liquidity and results of operations.

**_The forward-looking statements contained in this offering memorandum may prove to be incorrect._**

There can be no assurance that any estimates and assumptions contained in this offering memorandum will prove to
be correct. Our actual results in the future may vary significantly from the historical and estimated results and those
variations may be material. There is no representation by us that actual results achieved us or the combined company
in the future will be the same, in whole or in part, as those included in this offering memorandum. See “Caution
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements”.

**_Volatility of current global economic or financial conditions_**

Current global economic or financial conditions have been subject to continued volatility. Trade wars, import tariffs,
Brexit, public protests, rising consumer debt levels, epidemics, pandemics, or outbreaks of new infectious diseases
or viruses (including, most recently, COVID-19) and the risk of sovereign debt defaults in many countries have
caused and continue to cause significant uncertainties in the markets. Although we take appropriate measures and
safeguards to protect our staff from infection, these events can result in volatility and disruption to our operations
which may be beyond our control, and which could adversely affect the availability of supplies and materials, labor,
interest rates, credit ratings, credit risk, inflation, business operations, financial markets, exchange rates and other
factors material to us.

**Risks Related to the Notes**

**_We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us_**
**_from fulfilling our obligations under the Notes._**

We have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of March 31, 2021, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to this
offering and the Transactions we would have had, on a consolidated basis, total debt of $1,254 million (at face
value) (including the Notes offered hereby, the 2025 Senior Notes, Akumin Corp.’s Initial Financing Notes and
finance leases, but excluding other lease liabilities), $1,054 of which would have been secured indebtedness. As of
March 31, 2021, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to this offering and Transactions, we would have had $0.1
million of issued and undrawn letters of credit outstanding and $55 million of unused commitments under our
Revolving Credit Facility that are available to be borrowed thereunder to the extent the indenture governing the
Notes permits such incurrence. We will also be permitted, following the Closing, subject to the covenants in the
indenture that will govern the Notes, the 2025 Senior Notes Indenture, and the Revolving Credit Facility, to draw up
to approximately $490 million in additional Financing Notes pursuant to the Stonepeak Notes Commitment. See
“Capitalization.”

Subject to the limitations in the indenture, the indenture governing the 2025 Senior Notes, the Financing Notes and
the Revolving Credit Facility, we may also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. Our substantial
indebtedness may:

    - make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and
interest payments on the Notes and our other indebtedness;

    - increase our vulnerability to adverse economic, regulatory and industry conditions;

    - limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or
other general business purposes;

    - limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital
expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;


-----

    - require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments,
thereby reducing funds available for operations and other purposes;

    - limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;

    - make us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates; and

    - place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors.

Further, borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate
risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even
though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income would decrease.

**_Our level of indebtedness may increase and reduce our financial flexibility._**

After giving effect to this offering and the Transactions we expect to have, on a consolidated basis, $1,254 million
(at face value) aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding (including the Notes offered hereby, the 2025 Senior
Notes, Akumin Corp.’s Initial Financing Notes and finance leases, but excluding other lease liabilities), $0.1 million
of issued and undrawn letters of credit outstanding and $55 million available to be drawn under our Revolving
Credit Facility to the extent the indenture governing the Notes permits such incurrence. We will also be permitted,
following the Closing, subject to the covenants in the indenture that will govern the Notes, the 2025 Senior Notes
Indenture, and the Revolving Credit Facility, to issue up to approximately $490 million in additional Financing
Notes pursuant to the Stonepeak Notes Commitment. Under the agreements governing our indebtedness, we may
incur additional indebtedness under the credit facilities, through the issuance of notes, term loans or otherwise in the
future. We are exposed to changes in interest rates on our cash, bank indebtedness and long-term debt. Debt issued
at variable rates exposes us to cash flow interest rate risk. Debt issued at fixed rates exposes us to fair value interest
rate risk. Our borrowings, current and future, will require interest payments and need to be repaid or refinanced,
could require us to divert funds identified for other purposes to debt service and could create additional cash
demands or impair our liquidity position and add financial risk for us. Diverting funds identified for other purposes
for debt service may adversely affect our business and growth prospects. If we cannot generate sufficient cash flow
from operations to service our debt, we may need to refinance our debt, dispose of assets, reduce or delay
expenditures or issue equity to obtain necessary funds. We do not know whether we would be able to take any of
these actions on a timely basis, on terms satisfactory to us, or at all.

Our level of indebtedness could affect our operations in several ways, including the following:

    - a significant portion of our cash flows could be used to service our indebtedness;

    - the covenants contained in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness may limit our
ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets, pay dividends and make certain investments;

    - our debt covenants may also affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in the
economy and in our industry;

    - a high level of debt would increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry
conditions;

    - a high level of debt may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are
less leveraged and therefore may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our indebtedness
would prevent us from pursuing; and

    - a high level of debt may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working
capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions or other purposes.

In addition to our debt service obligations, our operations require material expenditures on a continuing basis. Our
ability to make scheduled debt payments, to refinance our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and to fund
capital and non-capital expenditures necessary to maintain the condition of our operating assets and properties, as


-----

well as to provide capacity for the growth of our business, depends on our financial and operating performance.
General economic conditions and financial, business and other factors affect our operations and our future
performance. Many of these factors are beyond our control. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to
pay the interest on our debt, and future working capital, borrowings or equity financing may not be available to pay
or refinance such debt.

**_We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt obligations, including our obligations under_**
**_the Notes._**

Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes, will depend on our
financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to
certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows
from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our
indebtedness, including the Notes.

If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to
reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or
refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not
permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we
could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet
our debt service and other obligations. The indenture governing the Notes restricts, and our Revolving Credit
Facility restricts our ability to dispose of assets, use the proceeds from any disposition of assets and to refinance our
indebtedness. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize
from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.

The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted, and we expect will continue to negatively impact, our cash flow
and liquidity profile. See “Summary—Recent Developments—COVID-19”. If our cash flows and capital resources
are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell
assets, seek to obtain additional equity capital or restructure our debt. In the future, our cash flows and capital
resources may not be sufficient for payments of interest on and principal of our debt, and such alternative measures
may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.

**_Despite our current level of indebtedness, we may still be able to incur substantially more indebtedness. This_**
**_could exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness._**

We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The terms of the
indenture governing the Notes, the indenture governing the 2025 Senior Notes and the terms of our Revolving
Credit Facility will limit, but do not prohibit, us or our restricted subsidiaries (including our professional service
affiliates) from incurring additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness. As of March 31, 2021, on an as
adjusted basis for this offering and the Transactions, we expect to have $55 million available for future borrowings
under our Revolving Credit Facility to the extent the indenture governing the Notes permits such incurrence. We
will also be permitted, following the Closing, subject to the covenants in the indenture that will govern the Notes,
the existing 2025 Senior Notes Indenture, and the Revolving Credit Facility, to draw up to approximately $490
million in Financing Notes pursuant to the Stonepeak Notes Commitment. In addition, the terms of the indenture
permit us in certain circumstances to incur additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, which may also
be guaranteed by the guarantors. If new indebtedness or other liabilities are added to our current debt levels,
including as a result of PIK interest payable on the Financing Notes, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries
now face could intensify.

**_Claims of holders of the Notes are structurally subordinate to claims of creditors of our subsidiaries that do not_**
**_guarantee the Notes, and we have made and we may make additional equity investments in joint ventures and_**
**_minority investments that are junior to the debt and other liabilities of such joint ventures and minority_**
**_investments. In addition, our joint ventures and minority investments do not guarantee the Notes and therefore_**
**_do not have any obligations to pay any amounts due on the Notes._**

As described under “Description of Notes—Guarantees”, the Notes are not guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries
and minority investments. Accordingly, claims of holders of the Notes are structurally subordinated to the claims of


-----

creditors of our non-guarantor subsidiaries and minority investments, including trade creditors. All obligations of
our non-guarantor subsidiaries and minority investments will have to be satisfied before any of the assets of these
entities would be available for distribution, upon a liquidation or otherwise, to us or a guarantor of the Notes. In the
event of the liquidation, dissolution, reorganization, bankruptcy or similar proceeding of the business of a
subsidiary, that is not a guarantor or of the businesses in which we have a minority investment, creditors of that
entity would generally have the right to be paid in full before any distribution is made to us or the holders of the
Notes. In any of these events, we may not have sufficient assets to pay amounts due on the Notes with respect to the
assets of that subsidiary. For the year ended March 31, 2021, after giving effect to the Transactions, our nonguarantor subsidiaries represented approximately 18.94% of our total revenue. As of March 31, 2021, our nonguarantor subsidiaries held approximately 11.38% of our total assets and approximately 3.08% of our total
liabilities.

Unless they are guarantors of the Notes, our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the
Notes or to make funds available to the issuer or the guarantors for that purpose. Our non-guarantor subsidiaries and
the businesses in which we have minority investments may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make
distributions or payments, as applicable, to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness, including the
Notes. Each non-guarantor subsidiary and the businesses in which we have minority investment is a distinct legal
entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from
our non-guarantor subsidiaries and minority investments. In addition, the guarantees of certain guarantors may be
released under certain other circumstances, including in connection with a transfer of such guarantor in a transaction
not prohibited by the indenture that governs the Notes or upon certain other events described in “Description of
Notes—Guarantees.”

**_In addition, in furtherance of our business strategy, we have made and may make additional minority_**
**_investments in joint ventures. Such joint ventures will not be subject to the covenants described under_**
**_“Description of Notes—Certain Covenants” and the earnings, if any, of any such joint venture may not be_**
**_available to us, including to the extent needed to service our debt. Our equity interests in such joint ventures_**
**_would be junior to the debt and other liabilities, including trade payables, of such joint ventures, and there may_**
**_be restrictions on our right to receive cash flow from such joint ventures. We will depend on the cash flows of our_**
**_subsidiaries, minority investments and professional service affiliates in order to satisfy obligations under the_**
**_Notes._**

We rely on distributions and advances from our subsidiaries, minority investments and professional service affiliates
in order to meet our payment obligations under the Notes and our other obligations. If our subsidiaries, minority
investments and professional service affiliates are unable to pay dividends or otherwise make payments to us, we
may not be able to make debt service payments on the Notes. We are a holding company and conduct substantially
all of our operations through our subsidiaries, minority investments and professional service affiliates. Our operating
cash flows and consequently our ability to service our debt, including the Notes, is therefore principally dependent
upon our subsidiaries’, minority investments’ and professional service affiliates’ earnings and their distributions of
those earnings to us and may also be dependent upon loans, advances or other payments of funds to us by those
subsidiaries, minority investments and professional service affiliates. Our subsidiaries, minority investments and
professional service affiliates are separate legal entities and to the extent they do not guarantee the Notes have no
obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amount due pursuant to the Notes or to make any funds available for
that purpose. In addition, the ability of our subsidiaries, minority investments and professional service affiliates to
provide funds to us to make payments in respect of the Notes may be subject to restrictions under charter
documents, joint venture agreements or other agreements binding on such entities and may be subject to the terms of
our subsidiaries’, minority investments’ and professional service affiliates’ future indebtedness, as well as the
availability of sufficient surplus funds under applicable law.

**_If we default on our obligations to pay our indebtedness, we may not be able to make payments on the Notes._**

Any default under the agreements governing our indebtedness, including a default under our Revolving Credit
Facility, that is not waived by the required lenders thereunder, and the remedies sought by the holders of such
indebtedness, could prevent us from paying principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes and substantially
decrease the market value of the Notes. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow and are otherwise unable to
obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, or
if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants, including financial and operating covenants, in the


-----

instruments governing our indebtedness (including a financial covenant in our Revolving Credit Facility), we could
be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness, including our Revolving Credit
Facility, the 2025 Senior Notes and the indenture. In the event of such default, the holders of such indebtedness
could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid
interest, the lenders under our Revolving Credit Facility or holders of our other indebtedness could elect to institute
foreclosure proceedings against our assets, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If our operating
performance declines, we may in the future need to obtain waivers from the required lenders under our Revolving
Credit Facility, holders of the 2025 Senior Notes or the Financing Notes, holders of our other indebtedness, to avoid
being in default. If we breach our covenants under our Revolving Credit Facility and seek a waiver, we may not be
able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders. If this occurs, we would be in default under our Revolving Credit
Facility or the 2025 Senior Notes, and the lenders could exercise their rights, as described above, and we could be
forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.

**_Your right to receive payments on the Notes and the guarantees is effectively subordinated to the extent that any_**
**_other indebtedness is secured by liens on assets not constituting Collateral._**

The indenture permits us to secure additional indebtedness on assets other than the Collateral (as defined in
“Description of Notes”) in the future which may include financing for potential acquisitions, working capital, capital
expenditures, financing and capital leases or general corporate purposes. The Notes are also effectively
subordinated, or otherwise subordinated by operation of applicable law, to any of ours and the guarantors’
obligations that are secured by liens on assets that have a priority, effectively or by operation of applicable law, to
the liens securing the Notes, to the extent of the value of the assets or property securing such obligations including,
as of March 31, 2021 on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, approximately $79 million of
finance leases, including the equipment financing to be assumed from Alliance, and $1.0 million related to the face
value of the Wesley Chapel Loan on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions.

If we or a guarantor becomes insolvent or is liquidated, the lenders under our or such guarantor’s indebtedness
secured by liens on assets other than the collateral will have claims on those assets securing their indebtedness and
will have priority over any claim for payment under the Notes or the guarantees to the extent of such security.
Holders of the Notes will participate in our remaining assets ratably with all holders of our unsecured indebtedness
that is deemed to be of the same class as the Notes, and potentially with all of our other general creditors and it is
possible that there would be no assets remaining after satisfaction of the claims of such secured creditors or, if any
assets remained, they might be insufficient to fully satisfy claims of the holders of the Notes.

**_The value of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Notes, our Revolving Credit_**
**_Facility, the 2025 Senior Notes and any other secured indebtedness._**

No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has been made in connection with this offering, and the fair market value
of the Collateral is subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, general economic conditions
and similar factors. The amount to be received upon a sale of the Collateral would be dependent on numerous
factors, including, but not limited to, the actual fair market value of the Collateral at such time, the timing and the
manner of the sale and the availability of buyers. By its nature, portions of the Collateral may be illiquid or
intangible and may have no readily ascertainable market value. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy
or similar proceeding, the Collateral may not be sold in a timely or orderly manner, and the proceeds from any sale
or liquidation of this Collateral may not be sufficient to pay our obligations under the Notes (after taking into all of
our other obligations secured thereby on a first-priority basis). Any claim for the difference between the amount, if
any, realized by holders of the Notes from the sale of the Collateral securing the Notes and the obligations, including
the Financing Notes, under the Notes will rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured
unsubordinated indebtedness and other obligations, including trade payables. In addition, in the event of a
foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, the lenders under our Revolving Credit Facility and the
holders of the 2025 Senior Notes will share the proceeds of the Collateral ratably with the holders of the Notes,
thereby diluting the Collateral coverage.

In addition, the security interest of the notes collateral agent is subject to practical problems generally associated
with the realization of security interests in Collateral. For example, the notes collateral agent may need to make
additional filings and obtain the consent of a third party to obtain or enforce a security interest in a contract, and the
notes collateral agent has no obligation to make such filings. We cannot assure you that the notes collateral agent


-----

will be able to make these filings or obtain any such consent on a timely basis or at all. We also cannot assure you
that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. These
requirements may limit the number of potential bidders for certain Collateral in any foreclosure or other auction and
may delay any sale, either of which events may have an adverse effect on the sale price of the Collateral. Therefore,
the practical value of realizing on the Collateral may, without the appropriate consents and filings, be limited. Also,
certain items included in the Collateral may not be transferable (by their terms or pursuant to applicable law) and
therefore the notes collateral agent may not be able to realize value from such items in the event of a foreclosure.
Accordingly, the notes collateral agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets and the value of the
Collateral may significantly decrease.

On November 2, 2020, we entered into the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement with the trustee under the 2025 Senior
Notes, the notes collateral agent under the 2025 Senior Notes, the administrative agent under our Revolving Credit
Facility, the collateral agent under our Revolving Credit Facility and the other parties thereto, which agreement sets
forth the respective rights of the holders of the Notes, the lenders under our Revolving Credit Facility and certain
future creditors of debt permitted to rank equally with the Notes and the obligations under our Revolving Credit
Facility. The notes collateral agent and the trustee for the holders, as authorized representative in respect of the
Notes, will join the First Lien Intercreditor on the Escrow Release Date. The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement
provides that the proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral are shared ratably among the lenders under our
Revolving Credit Facility, the holders of the 2025 Senior Notes, the holders of the Notes and such future creditors.
The value realized through enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to pay all obligations under the Notes
and the guarantees as well as all other obligations entitled to receive a ratable portion of such enforcement proceeds.
The indenture will permit the issuer and the guarantors to create additional liens on the Collateral under specified
circumstances, some of which liens may be pari passu with the liens securing the Notes. Any obligations secured by
such liens may further dilute the Collateral and limit the recovery from the realization of the Collateral available to
satisfy holders of the Notes.

**_Holders of the Notes may have only limited control over many decisions related to the Collateral._**

The rights of the holders of the Notes with respect to the Collateral are subject to the First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement among all holders of obligations secured on a first-priority basis by that Collateral, including the
obligations under our Revolving Credit Facility (including undrawn portions under the revolving credit portion of
our Revolving Credit Facility and any incremental facilities provided for under our Revolving Credit Facility), the
2025 Senior Notes and certain future creditors of debt permitted to rank equally with the Notes and the obligations
under our Revolving Credit Facility and the 2025 Senior Notes. Under the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement, the collateral agent under our Revolving Credit Facility has the exclusive right (subject to limited
exceptions) to exercise remedies and take enforcement actions relating to the Collateral acting at the direction of the
administrative agent under our Revolving Credit Facility until the earlier of (i) such date as obligations and
commitments under our Revolving Credit Facility(and any designated refinancing thereof) have been paid in full
and termination in accordance with its terms or (ii) the date that is 120 days subsequent to the occurrence of an event
of default under the indenture or any other agreement governing first lien debt (other than our Revolving Credit
Facility) subject to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement if the authorized representative of the holders of such debt
represents the largest outstanding aggregate principal amount of indebtedness secured by a first-priority lien on the
Collateral (other than our Revolving Credit Facility), such debt is then due and payable in full in accordance with
the terms of the agreement, and such authorized representative has complied with the applicable notice provisions,
provided that the agent under our credit facilities has not commenced and is not diligently pursuing the exercise of
remedies with respect to such Collateral or a material portion of the Collateral or the grantor of the security interest
in such Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) an insolvency or liquidation
proceeding. At any time that the administrative agent or collateral agent under our Revolving Credit Facility does
not have the right to direct the actions with respect to the Collateral securing the Notes pursuant to the First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement, the right to direct such actions will, subject to the terms and limitations of the immediately
preceding sentence, pass to the authorized representative of holders of the then largest outstanding principal amount
of indebtedness secured by a first-priority lien on the Collateral. If we have, at such time, outstanding indebtedness
that is equal in priority to the liens securing the Notes and the guarantees in a greater principal amount than the
aggregate principal amount of the Notes, then the authorized representative for such indebtedness may be next in
line to exercise rights under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, rather than the notes collateral agent. The First
Lien Intercreditor Agreement permits, and the indenture will permit, us to incur further indebtedness secured by


-----

liens ranking equally with the liens securing the Notes and the guarantees and the obligations under our Revolving
Credit Facility. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes may not be able to act quickly or at all to have
the notes collateral agent realize on the Collateral in the event of a default with respect to the Notes. See
“Description of Notes—Security—First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.”

Also, under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, in the event that the holders of the Notes obtain possession of
any Collateral or realize any proceeds or payment in respect of any such Collateral at any time prior to the discharge
of each of the other obligations secured on a first-priority basis by the Collateral, then such holders will be obligated
to hold such Collateral, proceeds, or payment in trust for the other holders of such other first-priority obligations and
promptly transfer such Collateral, proceeds, or payment, as the case may be, to the controlling collateral agent under
the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, to be distributed in accordance with the provisions of the First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement ratably among all the holders of obligations secured on a first-priority basis by the
Collateral subject thereto.

In addition, under the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, if at any time the controlling collateral agent
under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any resulting
in a sale thereof, the lien securing the Notes on such Collateral will be automatically released and discharged
(provided that any proceeds from such sale are applied ratably among all the then outstanding first-priority
obligations secured on a first priority basis by the Collateral). The Collateral so released will no longer secure our
and the guarantors’ obligations under the Notes and the guarantees.

To the extent that liens securing obligations under our Revolving Credit Facility, the 2025 Senior Notes, pre-existing
liens, liens permitted under the indenture and other rights, including liens on excluded assets, such as those securing
purchase money obligations and capital lease obligations granted to other parties (in addition to the holders of any
other obligations secured by higher priority liens to the extent permitted under the indenture), encumber any of the
Collateral securing the Notes and the guarantees, those parties may have or may exercise rights and remedies with
respect to the Collateral that could adversely affect the value of the Collateral and the ability of the notes collateral
agent, the trustee under the indenture or the holders of the Notes to realize or foreclose on the Collateral. By
accepting a note, you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions and will be deemed to have authorized the
notes collateral agent and the trustee to execute and deliver the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. As a result of
these restrictions, holders of the Notes may not be able to act quickly or at all to have the notes collateral agent
realize on the Collateral in the event of a default with respect to the Notes.

As of March 31, 2021, on an as adjusted basis, after giving effect to this offering as if it had occurred on March 31,
2021, we would have had $975 million (at face value) in indebtedness outstanding (including the Notes offered
hereby, the 2025 Senior Notes, $200 million Initial Financing Notes (but excluding the finance leases, Wesley
Chapel Loan and other lease liabilities)), $0.1 million of issued and undrawn letters of credit outstanding and $55
million of unused revolving commitments under our Revolving Credit Facility which are secured by liens on the
Collateral ranking equal in priority with the liens securing the Notes and the guarantees.

The value of the Collateral may not be sufficient to pay off all amounts we may borrow under our Revolving Credit
Facility, the 2025 Senior Notes, the Notes and additional indebtedness that we may incur that would be secured by
liens on the Collateral on a pari passu basis as the Notes. If the proceeds of any sale of Collateral are not sufficient to
repay all amounts due on the Notes (after taking into account all of our other obligations secured thereby), the
holders of the Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only a
senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim against our and the guarantors’ remaining assets with respect to such
deficiency.

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral securing the_**
**_Notes and the guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the trustee or the_**
**_notes collateral agent, and you may not realize any payment upon disposition of such Collateral._**

Under various circumstances, Collateral securing the Notes will be released automatically, including:

    - a sale, transfer or other disposal of such Collateral (other than to us or one of the guarantors) in a
transaction not prohibited under the indenture and the security documents;


-----

    - with respect to collateral held by a guarantor, upon the release of such guarantor from its guarantee in
accordance with the indenture;

    - upon satisfaction and discharge of the indenture or upon a legal defeasance or a covenant defeasance as
described under “Description of Notes—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance;”

    - with respect to all or substantially all of the Collateral, with the consent of holders holding two-thirds
or more of the principal amount of the Notes (including, without limitation, consents obtained in
connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for, or purchase of, the Notes) outstanding;

    - with respect to any guarantor that initially provided its guarantee of the Notes pursuant to the covenant
described under “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Additional Subsidiary Guarantees”
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, does not include any guarantor as of the issue date), upon the
release or discharge (other than a release or discharge by or as a result of payment under such
guarantee or payment in full of such indebtedness) of the guarantee by such guarantor of the
indebtedness that resulted in the requirement for such guarantor to provide its guarantee of the Notes;

    - with respect to any Collateral that becomes Excluded Property (as defined under “Description of
Notes— Security—General”), upon such Collateral becoming Excluded Property pursuant to a
transaction or circumstance not prohibited by the terms of the indenture;

    - with respect to Collateral that is capital stock, upon the dissolution of the issuer of that capital stock in
accordance with the indenture; and

    - with respect to any Collateral, in accordance with the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

The indenture also permits us to designate one or more of our restricted subsidiaries that is a guarantor as an
unrestricted subsidiary. If we designate a guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of the indenture, all of
the liens on any Collateral owned by that subsidiary or any of its subsidiaries and any guarantees by that subsidiary
or any of its subsidiaries will be released under the indenture. Designation of an unrestricted subsidiary will reduce
the aggregate value of the Collateral to the extent that liens on the assets of the unrestricted subsidiary and its
subsidiaries are released. In addition, the creditors of the unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries will have a
senior claim on the assets of such unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries.

**_The lenders under our Revolving Credit Facility have the discretion to release certain guarantors under our_**
**_Revolving Credit Facility under a variety of circumstances, which will cause those certain guarantors to be_**
**_released from their guarantees of the Notes._**

So long as any obligations under our Revolving Credit Facility remain outstanding, the guarantees of certain
guarantors added after the issue date may be released without action by, or consent of, any holder of the Notes or the
trustee under the indenture governing the Notes if, at the discretion of lenders under our Revolving Credit Facility,
such guarantor’s guarantee of our Revolving Credit Facility is released. The lenders under our Revolving Credit
Facility have the discretion to release such guarantees under our Revolving Credit Facility in a variety of
circumstances. Certain guarantors of the Notes added after the issue date that are released as guarantors under our
Revolving Credit Facility will automatically be released as guarantors of the Notes. You will not have a claim as a
creditor against any entity that is no longer a guarantor of the Notes, and the indebtedness and other liabilities,
whether secured or unsecured, of all released subsidiaries will effectively be senior to your claims as a holder of the
Notes.

**_The value of the Collateral may not be sufficient to secure post-petition or post-filing interest, fees, and expenses_**
**_in an Insolvency Proceeding of us or any of the guarantors. In the event of an Insolvency Proceeding of us or_**
**_any of the guarantors, the holders of the Notes would be deemed to have an unsecured claim to the extent that_**
**_our obligations in respect of the Notes and all of our other obligations secured by the Collateral equal or exceed_**
**_the fair market value of the Collateral._**

In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or similar proceeding brought by or against us
or any guarantors under Title 11 U.S.C. (the “Bankruptcy Code”), the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (the


-----

“CCAA”), the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (the “BIA”) or any similar Federal, state, provincial or foreign law for
the relief of debtors, and includes the plan of arrangement provisions of the Business Corporations Act (Ontario) and
any other applicable Federal, state or provincial corporate statute relating to the compromise or arrangement of
indebtedness (together with the Bankruptcy Code, the CCAA and the BIA, “Insolvency Law”) (such proceeding an
“Insolvency Proceeding”) located in the United States, holders of the Notes will only be entitled to post-petition
interest, fees, and expenses under the Bankruptcy Code to the extent that the value of their security interest in the
Collateral securing the Notes, taken in order of priority with all the other obligations secured by the Collateral, is
greater than the amount of their pre-bankruptcy claim (and all other claims against us or the guarantors that are
secured by the Collateral on a first-priority basis). While the law is not as clear in the case of an Insolvency
Proceeding located in Canada, the result would likely be the same in Canada. In such event, holders of the Notes
would be deemed to have an unsecured claim to the extent that our obligations in respect of the Notes (and all of our
other first-priority obligations) exceed the fair market value of the Collateral. No appraisal of the fair market value
of the Collateral has been prepared in connection with this offering and we therefore cannot assure you that the
value of the holders’ of the Notes interest in the Collateral equals or exceeds the principal amount of the Notes and
such other first-priority obligations. Holders of the Notes that have a security interest in Collateral with a value equal
or less than the amount of their pre-insolvency claim will not be entitled to post-petition interest, fees, and expenses
under the Bankruptcy Code, and the result would likely be the same in Canada. In addition, it is possible that the
bankruptcy trustee, the debtor-in-possession or competing creditors will assert that the fair market value of the
Collateral with respect to the Notes on the date of the filing of the Insolvency Proceeding was less than the then
current principal amount of the Notes (and all of our other first-priority obligations). Upon a finding by a court of
competent jurisdiction presiding over an Insolvency Proceeding (a “Bankruptcy Court”) that the Notes are undercollateralized, the claims in the Insolvency Proceeding with respect to the Notes would be bifurcated between a
secured claim equal to the value of the interest in the Collateral and an unsecured claim, and the unsecured claim
would not be entitled to the benefits of security in the Collateral. The consequences of a finding of undercollateralization would include, among other things, a lack of entitlement on the part of the holders of the Notes to
receive post-petition interest, fees, and expenses or to receive “adequate protection” under U.S. federal bankruptcy
laws on the part of the unsecured portion of the Notes. In addition, if any payments of post-petition interest had been
made at the time of such a finding of under-collateralization, those payments could be recharacterized by the
Bankruptcy Court as a reduction of the principal amount of the secured claim with respect to the Notes.

**_Lien searches may not reveal all liens on the Collateral and lien searches may not be completed until after the_**
**_date of this offering memorandum._**

We cannot guarantee that the lien searches on the Collateral that will secure the Notes and any guarantees will reveal
any or all existing liens on such Collateral. Any such existing lien, including undiscovered liens, could be
significant, could be prior in ranking to the liens securing the Notes and guarantees thereof and could have an
adverse effect on the ability of the notes collateral agent to realize or foreclose upon the Collateral securing the
Notes and any guarantees thereof.

Lien searches on the Collateral may not be completed until after the date of this offering memorandum. These lien
searches, once completed, could reveal a prior lien or multiple prior liens on the Collateral and these prior liens may
prevent or inhibit the collateral agent from foreclosing on the liens that will secure the Notes and may impair the
value of the Collateral.

**_Our professional service affiliates are independent entities with independent credit risks. These independent_**
**_credit risks may cause our professional service affiliates to potentially find themselves in a position where they_**
**_elect to file for bankruptcy or related relief for reasons wholly unconnected to Akumin’s operations or the Notes._**
**_If our professional service affiliates file for bankruptcy separately from these Notes, the holders of the Notes may_**
**_be unable to enforce claims and remedies against them._**

Our professional service affiliates constitute independent business entities with separate operations and assets, and
liabilities unrelated to the Notes. As a result, they could potentially find themselves in a position where they elect to
file for bankruptcy or related relief for reasons wholly unconnected to Akumin’s operations or the Notes. We have
not done any independent analysis of the credit risks these individual/separate entities face with respect to their own
operations and liabilities, and therefore can provide no assessment or assurance as to whether or not these entities
would potentially file for bankruptcy for reasons wholly unrelated to Akumin’s operations or the Notes/debt. If they
were to file for bankruptcy protection for unrelated reasons (including at a time when we were not in default under


-----

the Notes), applicable bankruptcy law would impact the holders of the Notes’ ability to enforce claims and remedies
against them and the Collateral they are providing under their guaranties.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Bankruptcy Code allows debtors to seek disallowance of certain
types of contingent claims, including claims for reimbursement or contribution from guarantors or similar parties.

**_We will in most cases have control over the Collateral and the sale of assets could reduce the pool of assets_**
**_securing the Notes and the guarantees._**

The security documents that will relate to the Notes and the guarantees allow us and the guarantors, subject to
certain exceptions, to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, operate and collect, and invest and
dispose of certain income from the Collateral that will secure the Notes. If we sell assets, including Collateral in
which the holders of the Notes have a first-priority lien, we may replace such Collateral with other assets that would
not constitute Collateral or use the net proceeds for such sale to repay certain indebtedness. In some cases, we may
sell some or all of the Collateral in which the holders of the Notes have a first-priority lien and not be required to
offer to repurchase the Notes. For example, if we sell an operating business and subsequently acquire a different
operating business, the holders of the Notes may lose some or all of the benefit of first-priority collateral if the
acquired business has less Collateral than the business that was sold. To the extent the proceeds from any sale of
Collateral do not constitute Collateral under the security documents, the pool of assets securing the Notes and any
guarantees will be reduced, and the Notes and any guarantees will not be secured by such proceeds.

**_There are also certain categories of property that are excluded from the Collateral, including property subject to_**
**_certain classes of permitted liens._**

The Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to liens permitted under the terms of the indenture, whether arising
on or after the date the Notes are issued, including, but not limited to, liens arising by operation of law or in the
ordinary course of business. The beneficiaries of such liens will not be required in all circumstances to join the First
Lien Intercreditor Agreement and therefore may take actions in respect of the Collateral that adversely affect the
interests of holders of the Notes. The existence of any permitted liens could adversely affect the value of the
Collateral as well as the ability to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. The Collateral may also secure future
indebtedness and other obligations of us and any guarantors to the extent permitted by the indenture and the security
documents. Any future liens on the Collateral may reduce the extent of the value of the Collateral that would be
available to pay obligations under the Notes and the guarantees. In addition, the imposition of certain permitted liens
may cause the relevant assets to become “excluded property,” which will not secure the Notes. Assets subject to
liens in favor of third parties to secure purchase money indebtedness and capital lease obligations may be
automatically excluded from the Collateral where the agreement governing such indebtedness or obligation prohibits
the grant of a lien on such assets to the notes collateral agent or requires the consent of any person other than us or
any of our consolidated subsidiaries.

Other categories of assets that are excluded from the Collateral include, amongst other categories, fee interests in
real property, leasehold real property, vehicles, certain equity interests and certain contracts and other assets. See
“Description of Notes—Security—General” for more information regarding these and other categories of excluded
assets.

The rights of holders of the Notes with respect to such excluded property will be equal to the rights of our and the
guarantors’ general unsecured creditors, including the Financing Notes (and effectively junior to the rights of our
and the guarantors’ creditors whose obligations are secured by a lien on such excluded property) to the extent of the
value of such excluded property in the event of any bankruptcy filed by or against us or the guarantors under
applicable U.S. federal bankruptcy laws.

**_Certain laws and regulations may impose restrictions or limitations on foreclosure or other enforcement._**

Our obligations under the Notes and the guarantors’ obligations under any guarantees are secured only by the
Collateral described in this offering memorandum. The security interests of in the Collateral will be subject to
practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral. The notes collateral
agent’s ability to foreclose on the Collateral on behalf of the holders of the Notes may be subject to perfection,
priority issues, state, provincial, territorial or other applicable law requirements, applicable Insolvency Law, and


-----

practical problems associated with the realization of the notes collateral agent’s security interest in or lien on the
Collateral, including cure rights, foreclosing on, or otherwise enforcing against, the Collateral within the time
periods permitted by third parties or prescribed by laws, obtaining third-party consents, making additional filings,
statutory rights of redemption and the effect of the order of foreclosure or other enforcement. We cannot assure you
that the consents of any third parties and approvals by governmental entities or courts of competent jurisdiction will
be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure or other enforcement on such assets. Therefore, we cannot assure
you that foreclosure or other enforcement on the Collateral will be sufficient to make all payments on the Notes. In
addition, to the extent that other permitted liens encumber any of the Collateral, those parties may have or exercise
rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral that could adversely affect the value of the Collateral and the
ability of the notes collateral agent to realize, foreclose on or otherwise enforce against the Collateral. Liquidating
the Collateral may not result in proceeds in an amount sufficient to pay any amounts due under the Notes, our
Revolving Credit Facility, the 2025 Senior Notes and any other pari passu secured indebtedness after also satisfying
the obligations to pay any creditors with prior liens. Furthermore, our professional service affiliates are guarantors
under the Notes; however, in states where corporate practice of medicine laws prohibit any entity other than a
professional corporation or similar professional organization from practicing medicine, holders of the Notes may not
be permitted to hold the equity in such entities following foreclosure on such Collateral. Likewise, we cannot be
sure that such Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in its liquidation.

**_Under certain local laws, liens securing the Notes and guarantees may not have the priority described in this_**
**_offering memorandum, and may rank junior to other secured indebtedness, and you must rely on the First Lien_**
**_Intercreditor Agreement to ensure that enforcement proceeds of the Collateral are allocated in the priority_**
**_described in this offering memorandum._**

Furthermore, under local law, the security interests securing the Notes and the guarantees may be subject to legal
doctrines that effectively rank them behind the security interests in favor of other obligations. Therefore, the
allocation of enforcement proceeds of the Collateral depends on the enforceability of the First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement. As a result, if the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement is found unenforceable or invalid for any reason, or
if any administrator, liquidator, or similar officer appointed under the laws of any relevant jurisdiction refuses to
give effect to it, the Notes may rank junior to other outstanding secured indebtedness. In addition, certain
jurisdictions may provide certain creditors with priorities of payment in the event of a guarantor’s bankruptcy or
insolvency.

**_The collateral is subject to casualty risks._**

We currently maintain and intend to maintain insurance or otherwise insure against hazards in a manner appropriate
and customary for our business. There are, however, certain losses that may be either uninsurable or not
economically insurable, in whole or in part. Insurance proceeds may not compensate us fully for our losses. If there
is a complete or partial loss of any of the pledged Collateral, the insurance proceeds may not be sufficient to satisfy
all of the secured obligations, including the Notes and the guarantees.

**_Security interests over certain of the Collateral may not be in place or perfected by the time the Notes are issued_**
**_or at the Closing. Any issues that we are not able to resolve in connection with the granting of such security_**
**_interests may impact the value of the Collateral. Creation or perfection of such security interests after the_**
**_issuance of the Notes increases the risk that the liens granted by those security interests could be avoided in an_**
**_Insolvency Proceeding._**

Certain security interests in favor of the notes collateral agent may not be in place by the time the Notes are issued.
To the extent any liens on or security interest in the Collateral are not perfected on or prior to the issuance of the
Notes, we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to have all such security interests perfected promptly
following the issuance of the Notes. Any issues that we are unable to resolve in connection with the delivery and
recordation of such security interests may negatively impact the value of the Collateral. Additionally, certain filings
and other actions required for perfection of the liens securing the Notes, prior to, on and after the date of the
issuance of the Notes may not be completed as a result of the occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic, including as a
result of any applicable registration system, filing offices or related service not being available. To the extent a
security interest in certain of the Collateral is perfected following the issuance of the Notes, any such security
interest that is perfected within 90 days (or in some cases, potentially a year) of the commencement of an Insolvency
Proceeding would be at risk of being avoided or voided as a preferential transfer by the pledgor, as debtor in


-----

possession, by its trustee in bankruptcy, or potentially by our other creditors, which could impact the value of the
Collateral, even after the security interests perfected on the issuance date of the Notes were no longer subject to such
risk.

**_Rights of holders of the Notes in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security_**
**_interests in certain Collateral, whether now owned or acquired in the future._**

The security interest in the Collateral securing the Notes includes certain assets, both tangible and intangible,
whether now owned or acquired or arising in the future. Applicable law requires that a security interest in certain
property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest can only be perfected at the time such
property and rights are acquired and identified. The trustee and the notes collateral agent are not obligated to, and
will not, monitor, and we may not inform the trustee or the notes collateral agent of, the future acquisition of
property and rights that constitute collateral, so the necessary action may not be taken to properly perfect the
security interest in such after-acquired collateral. Similarly, the necessary perfection steps may not be taken in
respect of security over Collateral currently owned for various reasons. We will have limited obligations to perfect
the security interest of the holders of the Notes in specified collateral. For example, we will not be required to
provide control agreements in respect of our deposit accounts or securities accounts and we will only be required to
make filings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the United States Copyright Office and the Canadian
Intellectual Property Office, as applicable, with respect to material intellectual property owned on the date the Notes
are issued. Such failure may result in the loss of the security interest therein or the priority of the security interest in
favor of the Notes against third parties. In addition, even if the liens on collateral acquired in the future are properly
perfected, such liens may (as described further herein) potentially be avoidable as a preference or otherwise in an
Insolvency Proceeding under certain circumstances. See “—Any future pledge of collateral or guarantee might be
avoidable in bankruptcy.” Neither the trustee nor the notes collateral agent have any duty to take any steps to perfect
or protect the security interest of the Collateral, or to otherwise monitor the compliance by us of our obligations
under the indenture and the Security Documents.

**_The Collateral securing the Notes may be diluted under certain circumstances._**

The Collateral that will secure the Notes also secures our obligations under the 2025 Senior Notes and our
Revolving Credit Facility. The Collateral may also secure additional senior indebtedness, including additional note
offerings, that we incur in the future, subject to restrictions on our ability to incur debts and liens under our
Revolving Credit Facility, the indenture governing the 2025 Senior Notes and the indenture governing the Notes.
Your rights to the collateral would be diluted by any increase in the indebtedness secured by the collateral on a pari
passu or priority basis.

**_Rights of holders of the Notes in the Collateral may be adversely affected by Insolvency Proceedings in the_**
**_United States or Canada._**

The right of the notes collateral agent to repossess and dispose of the Collateral securing the Notes upon an event of
default is likely to be significantly impaired (or at a minimum delayed) by Insolvency Law if Insolvency
Proceedings are commenced by or against us or a guarantor prior to or possibly even after the security agent has
repossessed and disposed of the Collateral.

_United States Insolvency Proceedings_

Under applicable U.S. federal bankruptcy laws, upon the commencement of a bankruptcy case, an automatic stay
goes into effect which, among other things, stays:

    - the commencement or continuation of any action or proceeding against the debtor that was or could
have been commenced before the commencement of the bankruptcy case to recover a claim against the
debtor that arose before the commencement of the bankruptcy case;

    - any act to obtain possession of, or control over, property of the debtor’s bankruptcy estate or the
debtor;

    - any act to create, perfect or enforce any lien against the property of the bankruptcy estate; and


-----

    - any act to collect or recover a claim against the debtor that arose before the commencement of the
bankruptcy case.

Under the Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor, such as the notes collateral agent, is prohibited from repossessing its
security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security repossessed from a debtor, without prior
Bankruptcy Court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances).

Moreover, U.S. bankruptcy law permits the debtor to continue to retain and to use collateral, including cash
collateral, and the proceeds, products, rents or profits of the collateral, even though the debtor is in default under the
applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection”. The meaning of the
term “adequate protection” may vary according to the circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the value
of the secured creditor’s interest in the collateral and may include cash payments or the granting of additional or
replacement security, if and at such time as the court in its discretion determines, for any diminution in the value of
the collateral as a result of the stay of repossession or disposition or any use of the collateral by the debtor during the
pendency of the bankruptcy case. A Bankruptcy Court may determine that a secured creditor may not require
compensation for a diminution in the value of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the debt it secures.
Generally, adequate protection payments, in the form of cash payments or otherwise, are not required to be paid by a
debtor to a secured creditor unless the Bankruptcy Court determines that the value of the secured creditor’s interest
in the collateral is declining during the pendency of the bankruptcy case, and any adequate protection payments
approved by the Bankruptcy Court are limited to the aggregate amount of diminution in value of the secured
creditors’ interest in the collateral occurring after the bankruptcy filing. In view of both the lack of a precise
definition of the term “adequate protection” under the Bankruptcy Code and the broad discretionary powers of a
Bankruptcy Court, it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under the Notes could be made following
the commencement of a bankruptcy case or the length of the delay in making any such payments; whether or when
the notes collateral agent could or would repossess or dispose of the collateral; the value of the Collateral at any time
during the course of the bankruptcy; or whether or to what extent or in what form holders of the Notes would be
compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral through the requirements of “adequate
protection” or otherwise. Furthermore, in the event the Bankruptcy Court determines that the value of the Collateral
is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes (and all of our other obligations that are secured by the
Collateral on a first-priority basis), the holders of the Notes would have “undersecured claims” as to the difference.
U.S. federal bankruptcy laws do not permit the payment or accrual of interest, costs, expenses and attorneys’ fees
during the debtor’s bankruptcy case to holders of “undersecured claims.” As a result, bankruptcy laws may act to
limit the holders of the Notes’ ability to realize upon the Collateral and to limit their ability to receive postbankruptcy interest, fees or expenses or “adequate protection” with respect to any unsecured portion of the Notes.

In addition, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement imposes limitations on the ability of the holders of the Notes to
object to a proposed debtor-in-possession financing or the use of cash collateral or to the Liens (or court-ordered
charges) securing the same (assuming certain protections and other requirements are in place in connection
therewith with respect to their liens on the Collateral and certain related rights) unless the authorized agent for the
lenders under our Revolving Credit Facility opposes or objects thereto. See “Description of Notes—Security—First
Lien Intercreditor Agreement.” After such a filing, the value of the Collateral could materially deteriorate, and
holders of the Notes would be unable to raise an objection.

_Canadian Insolvency Proceedings_

We are incorporated in, and subject to, the laws of the province of Ontario and the federal laws of Canada applicable
therein. Canadian Insolvency Law, which are principally contained in the CCAA and the BIA, are different from the
corporate insolvency or bankruptcy laws of the United States, however can be generally understood as analogous to
Chapter 11 and Chapter 7, respectively. These statutes apply across the country and allow for either a liquidation
type proceeding or a restructuring type proceeding.

As a result of these laws, among other things, noteholders and beneficiaries of guarantees could be stayed from
enforcing upon their Notes, guarantees and corresponding security after the commencement of Insolvency
Proceedings in Canada, or retaining security enforced upon prior to the commencement of such proceedings.
Moreover, in such proceedings, subject to the oversight of the applicable Bankruptcy Court, the issuer or guarantor
(or its trustee in bankruptcy, receiver or similar representative) may be permitted to continue to use Collateral,
including cash collateral, even though the issuer and/or guarantor is in default under the applicable Notes and/or


-----

guarantees. Moreover, there is no guarantee that payments will be made on account of secured debt, such as the
Notes and guarantees, during the pendency of a Canadian Insolvency Proceeding, or whether and to what extent
holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delays in payment, if any, of principal, interest and costs,
including the fees and disbursements of the notes collateral agent. Canadian Insolvency Law does not include the
concept of “adequate protection” liens or payments.

In addition, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement imposes limitations on the ability of the holders of the Notes to
take certain positions in a Canadian Insolvency Proceeding. See “Description of Notes—Security—First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement.”

Canadian Insolvency Proceedings - Liquidation

Bankruptcy proceedings in Canada can be either voluntarily commenced by a debtor or commenced against the
debtor by a creditor. Upon a bankruptcy occurring, all of the assets of the bankrupt (with a few limited exceptions)
vest in a trustee in bankruptcy, with the proceedings being subject to the oversight of both the Superintendent of
Bankruptcy and the relevant Bankruptcy Court. Typically, a trustee in bankruptcy proceeds to liquidate the assets of
the bankrupt and distribute the proceeds to creditors in accordance with their legal priorities.

The BIA and certain other federal and provincial statutes in Canada provide super-priority status to certain claims.
These super-priority status claims are secured on certain assets of the debtor and such security may rank in priority
to the security of other secured creditors, including security granted in connection with the Notes and guarantees.
After the claims subject to statutory super-priorities are paid, the BIA provides that secured creditors are to be paid
prior to unsecured creditors.

The BIA imposes a stay of proceedings on unsecured creditors in a bankruptcy and leave is required to proceed, or
continue, with any actions against the bankrupt entity; the stay generally does not apply to secured creditors, though
a stay may apply to secured creditors for up to six months in certain circumstances. If no stay applies, secured
creditors are free to commence or continue to enforce their security against the assets of the bankrupt, subject to
satisfying the trustee in bankruptcy that they have valid and perfected security over the same.

A secured creditor may also appoint a “receiver” or “receiver-manager” over the assets of a debtor, or may seek
court appointment of a receiver or receiver and manager. A receivership is intended as a mechanism for realizing on
collateral through a liquidation or a going-concern sale. The receivership remains subject to many of the
considerations in a bankruptcy, including super-priorities, reporting obligations, etc. although certain priorities will
be different where no bankruptcy is involved. Receivers appointed by the court are routinely authorized to borrow to
fund the receivership proceedings, on a super-priority basis. A receiver is often appointed where only the secured
creditors are likely to be paid out of the realizations or there is an opportunity to realize higher returns through a
going-concern sale of the business than a piecemeal liquidation. Ultimately, however, the effect is the same: the
realization on the debtor’s assets in favor of those creditors legally entitled to the proceeds.

Canadian Insolvency Proceedings - Restructuring

Generally, restructuring proceedings of insolvent entities are commenced under one of the CCAA or BIA, although
it is also possible to restructure a solvent enterprise under the reorganization or arrangement provisions of the
applicable federal or provincial corporate statute. Any such restructuring can, and almost always will, involve a stay
of proceedings with respect to creditors’ rights and remedies and a compromise of the debt, including secured debt,
owing by the restructuring entity. Such stays of proceedings, unlike under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, are
not automatic.

For large or complex restructurings, the most commonly used statute is the CCAA. The granting of an order for
relief under the CCAA is in the discretion of the court, but if granted, a CCAA initial order typically involves a
broad stay of proceedings (applying to secured and unsecured creditors), protection from the termination of
contracts by third parties, and, in certain cases, the granting of super-priority security interests or charges (which
could be in priority to the security of existing secured creditors) on the assets of the applicant debtor company to
secure the payment of any amounts to be borrowed from debtor-in-possession lenders to facilitate the restructuring,
any amounts owing for the fees and costs of professionals involved in the restructuring, obligations of directors of
the company with respect to their statutory liabilities and sometimes other amounts. Unlike a Chapter 11 proceeding,


-----

post-filing assets of a debtor company are encumbered by pre-filing security interests, and so there are no
unencumbered assets (including cash collateral) against which adequate protection liens could be granted.
Accordingly, secured creditors who are primed by debtor-in-possession financing or other charges are not given
replacement liens to the extent of their subordination.

Debtors in Canada may also proceed with a restructuring under the proposal provisions of the BIA. The proposal
provisions of the BIA (the “Proposal Provisions”) provide for a process that is generally similar to, but less flexible
than, restructuring proceedings under the CCAA. Upon filing a proposal (or a notice of intention to make a
proposal), the BIA provides an automatic stay of proceedings, however the stay only applies to secured creditors if
the proposal includes an offer to secured creditors. Such stay will remain in place until the trustee administering the
proposal proceedings is discharged (e.g., the proposal is implemented and the proceedings concluded) or the debtor
becomes bankrupt (e.g., via a failed proposal, as discussed below). The stay does not prevent a secured creditor from
(i) dealing with the assets of the insolvent person if it took possession of the secured assets for the purpose of
realization before the filing of the proposal or notice of intention to file a proposal and (ii) enforcing its security
against the debtor if the secured creditor gave the required notice under the BIA more than ten days before the filing
of the proposal or notice of intention to file a proposal, or if the debtor consents to the enforcement by the secured
creditor in accordance with the BIA. In the case of any proceedings under the Proposal Provisions, the applicant
debtor is protected from the termination of most contracts by third parties.

The Proposal Provisions allow for the granting of super priority charges (similar to the CCAA), including to secure
debtor-in-possession financing. Like in the CCAA, no adequate protection payments or liens are available under the
Proposal Provisions, because there are no unencumbered assets created by the filing.

Canadian Insolvency Proceedings – Recognition Proceedings

In the event of a foreign insolvency proceeding, both the CCAA and the BIA allow a representative, authorized in a
foreign proceeding in respect of a debtor, to seek recognition of the foreign insolvency proceeding in Canada (which
is similar to a Chapter 15 type proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code). The CCAA and the BIA each provide for a
modified version of the UNCITRAL model insolvency law.

**_In the event of an Insolvency Proceeding of us or any of the guarantors, holders of the Notes may be deemed to_**
**_have an unsecured claim to the extent that our obligations in respect of the Notes and all of our other obligations_**
**_secured by the Collateral exceed the value of the collateral available to secure the Notes and such other_**
**_obligations._**

No appraisal of the fair market value of the Collateral securing the Notes has been made in connection with this
offering and the value of the Collateral will depend on market and economic conditions, the availability of buyers
and other factors. The book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such
assets. We cannot assure you of the value of the Collateral or that the net proceeds received upon a sale of the
Collateral would be sufficient to repay all, or would not be substantially less than, amounts due on the Notes
following a foreclosure upon the Collateral (and any payments in respect of prior liens) or a liquidation of our assets
or the assets of the guarantors that may grant these security interests. (after taking into account all of our other
obligations that are also secured by the Collateral on a first-priority basis).

In any Insolvency Proceeding with respect to us or any of the guarantors, it is possible that the bankruptcy trustee,
the debtor-in-possession, any official committee of unsecured creditors appointed in such Insolvency Proceeding or
any other creditor (secured or unsecured) will assert that the value of the Collateral securing the Notes and all of our
other obligations secured by the Collateral is less than the aggregate amount of the principal and other amounts
outstanding under the Notes and such other obligations. Upon a finding by the Bankruptcy Court that the Notes are
under-collateralized, the claims in the Insolvency Proceeding with respect to the Notes would be bifurcated between
secured claims up to the value of the collateral securing the Notes and an unsecured claim for any deficiency. The
consequences of a finding of under-collateralization would include, among other things, (i) a lack of entitlement on
the part of the holders of the Notes to receive post-petition interest, fees, costs and expenses otherwise payable under
the Notes, and (ii) a lack of entitlement to receive “adequate protection” under U.S. Insolvency Laws with respect to
the unsecured portion of the Notes. In addition, if any payments of post-petition interest, fees, costs and expenses
had been made on account of the Notes at or before the time of such a finding of under-collateralization, those
payments could be recharacterized by the Bankruptcy Court as a reduction of the principal amount of the Notes. For


-----

these purposes, the value of any collateral that the collateral trustee does not have a perfected security interest in will
be zero.

In the event of a liquidation, foreclosure or other enforcement, the value of the Collateral securing the Notes is
subject to fluctuations based on factors that include general economic conditions, the actual fair market value of the
Collateral at such time, the timing and the manner of the sale and the availability of buyers and similar factors. The
value of the assets pledged as Collateral for the Notes also could be impaired in the future as a result of our failure to
implement our business strategy, competition or other future trends. In addition, courts could limit recoverability
with respect to the Collateral if they apply certain laws to a proceeding and deem a portion of the interest claim
usurious in violation of applicable public policy. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral may be illiquid and may
have no readily ascertainable market value. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Collateral will be saleable or, if
saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in its liquidation. A portion of the Collateral may include assets that
may only be usable, and thus retain value, as part of our existing operating business. Accordingly, any such sale of
the Collateral separate from the sale of certain of our operating businesses may not be feasible or of significant
value. To the extent that liens, rights and easements granted to third parties encumber assets located on property
owned by us or the subsidiary guarantors or constitute senior, pari passu or subordinate liens on the Collateral, those
third parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property subject to such encumbrances
(including rights to require marshalling of assets) that could adversely affect the value of the Collateral located at a
particular site and the ability of the trustee to realize, foreclose on or otherwise enforce against the Collateral at that
site.

**_Any future pledge of collateral or guarantee might be avoidable._**

Any security interests or guarantees issued after the issue date of the Notes may be treated under Insolvency Law as
if they were delivered to secure or guarantee previously existing indebtedness. Accordingly, any future pledge of
collateral or future issuance of a guarantee in favor of the notes collateral agent or the holders of the Notes,
including pursuant to security documents or guarantees delivered in connection therewith after the date of the
indenture, might be avoidable by the pledgor or guarantor (as debtor-in-possession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy
(or potentially by certain of our other creditors) as a preference or otherwise if certain events or circumstances exist
or occur, including, among others, if (i) the pledgor or guarantor is insolvent at the time of the pledge or the issuance
of the guarantee, (ii) the pledge or the issuance of the guarantee permits the holders of the Notes to receive a greater
recovery than they would receive if the pledge or guarantee had not been given and the pledgor or guarantor were
liquidated under a hypothetical case under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code or, in Canada, the pledge or the
issuance of the guarantee has the effect of giving the recipient creditor a preference, and (iii) an Insolvency
Proceeding in respect of the pledgor or guarantor is commenced within 90 days following the pledge or the
perfection thereof or the issuance of the guarantee (as applicable), or, in certain circumstances, a longer period.
Accordingly, if an Insolvency Proceeding was commenced in respect of us or any guarantor after the issue date of
the Notes and (1) any liens not granted on the issue date of the Notes were perfected, or (2) any guarantees not
issued on the issue date of the Notes (as applicable) were issued, within 90 days (or potentially one year for any
“insiders” or a recipient not “dealing at arm’s length”) before the commencement of such Insolvency Proceeding,
such liens or guarantees would be more likely to be avoided as a preference by the Bankruptcy Court than if
delivered and promptly recorded on the issue date of the Notes (even if the liens perfected or other guarantees issued
on the issue date of the Notes would no longer be subject to such risk). To the extent that the grant of any such
mortgage or other security interest and/or guarantee is avoided as a preference or otherwise, holders of the Notes
would lose the benefit of the mortgage or security interest and/or guarantee (as applicable).

Under certain applicable law in Canada, such pledges or issuances could be voided by a Canadian court even if the
pledgor or issuer was not insolvent at the time of the pledge or issuance, and no Insolvency Proceeding was
subsequently commenced, if the pledgor or issuer intended to defeat, delay or prejudice one or more of its creditors
by making the pledge or issuance.

**_There are restrictions on your ability to transfer or resell the Notes without registration under applicable_**
**_securities laws._**

The Notes are being offered pursuant to an exemption from registration under United States and applicable state
securities laws. Therefore, you may transfer or resell the Notes in the United States only in a transaction registered
under or exempt from the registration requirements of the United States and applicable state securities laws, and you


-----

may be required to bear the risk of your investment for an indefinite period of time. See “Transfer Restrictions.” By
receiving the Notes, you will be deemed to have made certain acknowledgments, representations and agreements as
set forth under “Transfer Restrictions.” We will not be required to, and do not intend to, register the Notes with the
SEC pursuant to a registration rights agreement.

**_The indenture will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and we will not be required to comply with the_**
**_provisions of the Trust Indenture Act._**

The indenture will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (the “Trust Indenture Act”) and we will
not be required to comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act. Therefore, holders of the Notes will not be
entitled to the benefit of the provisions and protection of the Trust Indenture Act except to the extent there are
similar provisions in the indenture.

**_Your ability to transfer the Notes may be limited by the absence of an active trading market, and an active trading_**
**_market may not develop for the Notes._**

There is currently no established trading market for the Notes. We do not intend to have the Notes listed on a
national securities exchange or to arrange for quotation on any automated dealer quotation system. The initial
purchasers are not obligated to make a market in the Notes, and, to the extent that the initial purchasers make a
market in the Notes, they may discontinue their market-making activities at any time without notice. Therefore, we
cannot assure you as to the development or liquidity of any trading market for the Notes. The liquidity of any market
for the Notes will depend on a number of factors, including:

    - the number of holders of the Notes;

    - our operating performance and financial condition;

    - the market for similar securities;

    - the interest of securities dealers in making a market in the Notes; and

    - prevailing interest rates.

Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial
volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The market, if any, for the Notes may face similar
disruptions that may adversely affect the prices at which you may sell your Notes. Therefore, you may not be able to
sell your Notes at a particular time and the price that you receive when you sell may not be favorable.

**_The Notes or a subsidiary guarantee (or the related security interests) could be voided if it constitutes a_**
**_fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance under Insolvency Law, or similar state or provincial law, which_**
**_would prevent the holders of the Notes from relying on us or that subsidiary (or the related security interests) to_**
**_satisfy claims._**

_Preferences and Fraudulent Transfers in the United States_

Under U.S. bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance laws,
the Notes or a guarantee (or the related security interests) can be voided, or claims under the Notes or the guarantee
may be subordinated to all other debts of the issuer or that guarantor if, among other things, the issuer or the
guarantor, at the time it incurred the indebtedness evidenced by the Notes or its guarantee or, in some states, when
payments become due under the Notes or the guarantee, received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair
consideration for the incurrence of the Notes or the guarantee (and the related security interests) and:

    - was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence;

    - was engaged (or about to engage) in a business or transaction for which the issuer’s or the guarantor’s
remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital; or


-----

    - intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay those debts as they
mature.

The Notes or a guarantee (or the related security interests) may also be voided, without regard to these factors, if a
court finds that the issuer issued the Notes or the guarantor entered into the guarantee (and provided the related
security interests) with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud its creditors.

As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation,
property is transferred or a valid antecedent indebtedness is satisfied. A court would likely find that the issuer or a
guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the Notes or such guarantee and/or
lien if the issuer or such guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the Notes
or the applicable guarantee and/or lien. Thus, if the guarantees were legally challenged, any guarantee could be
subject to the claim that, since the guarantee was incurred for the issuer’s benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit
of the guarantor, the obligations of the applicable guarantor were incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value
or fair consideration. Therefore, a court could void the obligations under the Guarantees and the related liens,
subordinate them to the applicable guarantor’s other indebtedness or take other action detrimental to the holders of
the Notes. If a court were to void a guarantee, you would no longer have a claim against the guarantor. Sufficient
funds to repay the Notes may not be available from other sources, including the remaining guarantors, if any. In
addition, the court might direct you to repay any amounts that you already received from the subsidiary guarantor.

The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance laws vary depending upon
the governing law, such that we cannot be certain as to: the standards a court would use to determine whether or not
the issuer or the guarantors were solvent at the relevant time, or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, that it
would not determine that the issuer or a guarantor was indeed insolvent on that date; that any payments to the
holders of the Notes (including under the guarantees) did not constitute preferences, fraudulent conveyances or
fraudulent transfers on other grounds; or that the issuance of the Notes and the guarantees would not be subordinated
to the Issuer’s or any guarantor’s other indebtedness. Generally, the issuer or a guarantor would be considered
insolvent if:

    - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, were greater than the fair value of all its assets;

    - the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount that would be required to pay its
probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and
mature; or

    - it could not pay its debts as they become due.

Each subsidiary guarantee contains a provision intended to limit the guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount
that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its subsidiary guarantee to be a fraudulent
transfer or fraudulent conveyance. However, this provision may not be effective as a legal matter or otherwise to
protect the subsidiary guarantees from being voided under fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance law, or may
reduce that guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its guarantee worthless.

In addition, any payment by the issuer pursuant to the Notes or by a guarantor under a guarantee made at a time the
issuer or such guarantor was found to be insolvent could be voided and required to be returned to the issuer or such
guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the issuer’s or such guarantor’s creditors if such payment is made to an
insider within a one-year period prior to a bankruptcy filing or within 90 days for any non-insider party and such
payment would give such insider or non-insider party (as the case may be) more than such creditor would have
received in a distribution under the Bankruptcy Code in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case.

Finally, as a court of equity, the bankruptcy court may otherwise subordinate the claims in respect of the Notes or
the guarantees to other claims against the issuer or the guarantors under the principle of “equitable subordination”, if
the court determines that: (i) the holders of the Notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct; (ii) such
inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holders of the
Notes; and (iii) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.

_Preferences, Transfers-at-Undervalue and Fraudulent Conveyances in Canada_

In the context of Canadian Insolvency Proceedings, a trustee in bankruptcy, monitor or proposal trustee may be
required to review asset transfers and transactions undertaken by the bankrupt or insolvent debtor within specified
time periods prior to the commencement of the Insolvency Proceedings to determine if the debtor was engaged in
any preferential transactions or transfers at undervalue. In the case of transfers at undervalue, the review period is
one year (or five years for parties not dealing at arm’s length) and preferences are subject to review if they occurred
within three months (or twelve months for parties not dealing at arm’s length). Provincial laws regarding fraudulent
preferences, transfers at undervalue and fraudulent conveyances may also apply, and may have longer applicable
review periods.

A note issued, secured granted, or guarantee given (each an “Issuance”) to an arm’s length party could be voided as
a preference if the issuer made the Issuance with the intent of defeating, delaying or defrauding creditors or with a
view to giving the creditor a preference (if the Issuance has the effect of bestowing a preference, intent is presumed)
and could be voided as a transfer at undervalue if (1) the issuer was insolvent at the time the Issuance was made, or
rendered insolvent by reason of the Issuance and (2) the issuer did not receive any consideration for the Issuance, or
if the consideration received for the Issuance was conspicuously less than the fair market value of the Issuance. In
the case of parties not dealing at arm’s length, neither the insolvency nor the intention of the party making the
Issuance is relevant to the determination of whether or not the Issuance was a preference or a transfer at undervalue
in the first twelve months prior to such Issuance.

Provincial legislation applicable in Canada also provides for an Issuance to be voided if it is preferential or
determined to be a fraudulent conveyance. The standard of proof and look-back periods vary, but generally the
transfer must be made with the intention to defeat, delay or prejudice creditors, and in many cases do not require the
issuer to be insolvent or rendered insolvent by the Issuance in order for the Issuance to be voided.

If a court were to find that the Issuance was a preference, transfer at undervalue or fraudulent conveyance, the court
could void the payment obligations under the note or guarantee or subordinate the corresponding security to
presently existing and future indebtedness of the applicable guarantor, or require the holders of the Notes or
guarantees to repay any amounts received. In the event of a finding that a preference, transfer at undervalue or
fraudulent conveyance occurred, the holders of the Notes may not receive any repayment on the Notes.

We cannot be certain that the issuance of the guarantees or any security would not be subordinated to any of the
issuer or guarantors’ other debt or determined by a court to be void.

**_Upon a change of control of us, we may not have the funds necessary to finance the change of control offer_**
**_required by the indenture, which would violate the terms of the Notes._**

Upon the occurrence of a change of control of us, holders of the Notes will have the right to require us to purchase
all or any part of the Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
to the date of purchase. We may not have sufficient financial resources available to satisfy all of our obligations
under the Notes in the event of a change in control. Accordingly, we may be unable to satisfy our obligations to
purchase the Notes. Our failure to purchase the Notes as required under the indenture would result in a default under
the indenture and a cross-default under our Revolving Credit Facility, each of which could have material adverse
consequences for us and the holders of the Notes. In addition, the holders of the 2025 Senior Notes may also require
us to purchase such Notes upon a Change of Control and our Revolving Credit Facility provides that a change of
control is a default that permits lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings under it. Furthermore, if we are
subject to a change of control for purposes of the Financing Notes, we may voluntarily repurchase or be required to
repurchase the Financing Notes at the prices specified in such Financing Notes up to a maximum of 125% if such
change of control occurs prior to the first anniversary of the issuance of such Financing Notes, decreasing 5% per
year for the next three subsequent years and decreasing to 105% between the sixth and seventh anniversaries of the
issuance of such Financing Notes.


-----

**_Certain covenants that will be contained in the indenture will not be applicable during any period in which the_**
**_Notes are rated investment grade._**

The indenture governing the Notes will provide that certain covenants will not apply to us and our restricted
subsidiaries (including our professional service affiliates) during any period in which the Notes are rated investment
grade by both Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and no default or event of
default has otherwise occurred and is continuing under the indenture. The covenants that would be suspended will
include, among others, limitations on and our restricted subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends, incur indebtedness,
sell certain assets and enter into certain other transactions. Any actions that we take while these covenants are not in
force will not constitute an event of default even if the Notes are subsequently downgraded below investment grade
and such covenants are subsequently reinstated. See “Description of Notes–Suspension of covenants.” There can be
no assurance that the Notes will ever be rated investment grade, or that if they are rated investment grade, the Notes
will maintain such ratings.

**_The trading prices for the Notes will be directly affected by many factors, including our credit rating._**

Credit rating agencies continually revise their ratings for companies they follow, including us. Any ratings
downgrade could adversely affect the trading price of the Notes, or the trading market for the Notes, to the extent a
trading market for the Notes develops. The condition of the financial and credit markets and prevailing interest rates
have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future, and any fluctuation may impact the trading price
of the Notes.

**_Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to_**
**_increase significantly._**

Borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If
interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness could increase even though the
amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our
indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease. As of March 31, 2021, on an as adjusted basis after giving effect to
this offering and the Transactions and assuming we have not made any drawings under our Revolving Credit
Facility, approximately $4.7 million of our debt would have been variable rate debt. In the future, we may enter into
interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest
rate volatility. However, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate
indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk.

**_Holders of Notes may not be able to determine when a change of control giving rise to their right to have the_**
**_Notes purchased has occurred following a sale of “substantially all” of our assets._**

The definition of change of control in the indenture includes a phrase relating to the sale of “all or substantially all”
of our assets. There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Notes to require us to purchase the Notes as a result of a sale of less than all
our assets to another person may be uncertain. See “Description of Notes—Change of Control.”

**_Interest paid on the Notes may be treated as U.S. source interest, in which case, U.S. federal withholding tax of_**
**_30% may apply unless a non-U.S. holder qualifies for an exemption from such withholding tax._**

It is contemplated that the net proceeds of this offering will directly or indirectly be on-lent by us to a wholly-owned
U.S. subsidiary of the issuer for the purposes described under “Use of Proceeds”. As a result, the IRS could argue
that the issuance of the Notes, together with the contemplated on-lending, is a tax avoidance plan and that interest on
the Notes is U.S. source interest, which if paid to a non-U.S. holder is subject to withholding tax at 30% unless the
non-U.S. holder qualifies for an applicable exemption.

Although not free from doubt, we do not believe that the issuance of the Notes and the contemplated on-lending
constitute a tax avoidance plan because we expect holders of the Notes to be U.S. holders or non-U.S. holders who
qualify for an exemption from the 30% withholding tax. In this regard, to assist us in establishing that no tax
avoidance plan exists, each investor will, if requested by us, take commercially reasonable efforts to provide an
applicable U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 or W-9.

**_In the event that the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the Outside Date, the Acquisition is_**
**_terminated at any time prior thereto, or other conditions to the release of the escrowed proceeds of this offering_**
**_are not satisfied, the Notes will be subject to the special mandatory redemption, and, as a result, you may not_**
**_obtain the return you expect on the Notes._**

The offering may be consummated prior to the closing of the Acquisition. If this offering closes prior to the
consummation of the Acquisition the Escrow Issuer will deposit into an escrow account, concurrently with the
closing of this offering, the gross proceeds from the sale of the Notes offered hereby plus an amount sufficient to
pay interest with respect to the Notes up to, but not including, the then-applicable latest possible Special Mandatory
Redemption Date. The release of the escrow proceeds will be subject to the satisfaction of the Escrow Release
Conditions. The proceeds of the offering will be used to partially fund the Transactions. The Escrow Agent will
release the escrow proceeds to us at the time of the consummation of the Acquisition on substantially the terms
described in this offering memorandum if the conditions described in this offering memorandum are satisfied.

If the Acquisition is not consummated by the Outside Date, or upon the occurrence of certain other events, we will
be required to redeem all of the outstanding Notes at the Special Mandatory Redemption Price. Upon such
redemption, you may not be able to reinvest the proceeds from the redemption in an investment that yields
comparable returns. In addition, if you purchase the Notes at a price greater than the issue price of the Notes, you
may suffer a loss on your investment. Although we currently believe that all conditions to the Acquisition will be
satisfied and expect to consummate the Acquisition before the deadline for the special mandatory redemption, we
cannot assure you that the conditions will be satisfied or waived, that we will in fact close the Acquisition on
substantially the terms described in this offering memorandum, or that we will not otherwise have to redeem the
Notes. If for any reason we believe that the Acquisition will not close before the deadline for special mandatory
redemption, we have the option to redeem the Notes earlier on the same terms. See “Description of Notes—Escrow
of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

If the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the closing of this offering and the proceeds are placed into
escrow, the funds will be released and utilized as described in “Description of Notes”, “The Transactions” and “Use
of Proceeds” upon delivering to the Escrow Agent an officer’s certificate stating that the conditions to the release of
the proceeds from escrow have been satisfied. The escrowed funds will be released from escrow to consummate the
Acquisition even if a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (or would have occurred had the
issuer or any of the guarantors (after giving effect to the Acquisition) been subject to all of the provisions of the
indentures governing the Notes as of the date of consummation of this offering).

Although we currently believe that all conditions to the Acquisition will be satisfied and expect to consummate the
Acquisition before the deadline for the special mandatory redemption, we cannot assure you that the conditions will
be satisfied or waived, that we will in fact close the Acquisition on substantially the terms described in this offering
memorandum or that we will not otherwise have to redeem the Notes. Many of the conditions to the closing of the
Acquisition are not within our control, and we cannot predict when or if these conditions will be satisfied.

**_If we became subject to bankruptcy proceedings, the escrow funds might be deemed to be property of the_**
**_bankruptcy estate, and the holders of the Notes might become unsecured creditors and might not be able to apply_**
**_the escrow funds to repay the Notes without bankruptcy court approval._**

If we commence a bankruptcy or reorganization case, or one is commenced against us, prior to the consummation of
the Acquisition and while escrow funds are still deposited in the escrow account, bankruptcy law may prevent the
trustee under the indenture governing the Notes from using the escrow funds to fund the special mandatory
redemption. The court adjudicating our bankruptcy or reorganization case might find that the escrow funds are
property of the bankruptcy estate. If it makes such a determination, the court could authorize the use of these funds
by the bankruptcy estate or the bankruptcy trustee, if one is appointed, with or without restrictions. Unless otherwise
provided with any adequate protection or other protections in connection with such use, the holders of the Notes
could become unsecured creditors of the bankruptcy estate. In such event, the only remedy available to the holders
of the Notes would be to sue or otherwise assert a claim for payment on the Notes. Also, although the amounts in the
escrow account will be pledged as security for the Notes during the term of the escrow, the automatic stay
provisions of the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable Bankruptcy Law generally prohibit (or at a minimum delay)
secured creditors from foreclosing upon or disposing of a debtor’s property without prior bankruptcy court approval
(which may not be given under the facts in any particular circumstances). As a result, the holders of the Notes may


-----

not be able to have the escrow funds in the escrow account applied at the time or in the manner contemplated by the
indentures governing the Notes and could suffer a loss as a result.

**_Until the consummation of the Acquisition, the Escrow Issuer will have limited assets and the Notes will not be_**
**_guaranteed._**

Holders of the Notes will not have any recourse to Akumin, Alliance or any of their subsidiaries prior to the
consummation of the Acquisition. Until the completion of the Acquisition, the Notes will be the obligation solely of
the Escrow Issuer and the Notes will not be guaranteed. The Escrow Issuer will have limited Assets until such time
and, as a result, the sole recourse of the holders prior to the consummation of the Acquisition will effectively be to
the funds deposited in the escrow account.

**_Between the time of the issuance of the Notes and the consummation of the Acquisition, the parties to the Share_**
**_Purchase Agreement may agree to modify or waive the terms or conditions of such document without the consent_**
**_of the holders of the Notes._**

Prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, the parties to the Share Purchase Agreement (as defined in “The
Transactions”) may agree to amendments or waivers of the terms thereof. Although the Escrow Agreement (as
defined herein) provides as a condition to the release of the escrow funds that the Escrow Issuer certifies that the
Acquisition is to be consummated substantially as described in this offering memorandum, that requirement will not
preclude the transaction parties from making certain changes to the terms of the transactions or from waiving certain
conditions to the transactions.

**_Until the consummation of the Acquisition, the Escrow Issuer will have limited assets and Akumin, Alliance and_**
**_their subsidiaries will not be subject to the covenants in the indenture that will govern the Notes._**

Holders of the Notes will not have any recourse to Akumin, Alliance or any of their subsidiaries prior to the
consummation of the Acquisition. Until the completion of the Acquisition, the Notes will be the obligation solely of
the Escrow Issuer. The Escrow Issuer will have limited Assets until such time and, as a result, the sole recourse of
the holders prior to the consummation of the Acquisition will effectively be to the funds deposited in the escrow
account. Prior to the satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions, Akumin, Alliance and their restricted
subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the covenants set forth in the Indenture. Pursuant to the terms of the
Acquisition, Akumin, Alliance and their subsidiaries generally are required to operate in the ordinary course of
business prior to the consummation of the Acquisition.

**THE TRANSACTIONS**

**Summary of the Acquisition**

On June 25, 2021, through our wholly-owned indirect subsidiary, Akumin Corp., we entered into the Share Purchase
Agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Holdings, which owns 100% of the
common stock of Alliance, from the Seller. The aggregate purchase price (the “Purchase Price”) payable to the
Seller at the Closing is $820 million, which will include the issuance to the Seller of 14,223,570 of our common
shares representing 19.99% of our issued and outstanding common shares at June 25, 2021, at a price of $2.98 per
share (the “Issue Price”). The Purchase Price will be satisfied by way of a combination of cash on hand, the issuance
of the Share Consideration as well as certain financing arrangements, including a debt and equity financing
commitment with Stonepeak, as described below under “—Summary of the Financings” and the proceeds of the
Notes offered hereby.

The transaction is an arm’s length transaction and is subject to the receipt of certain regulatory approvals, including
the expiry or termination of the waiting period (the “HSR Clearance”) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act (the “HSR Act”), together with the satisfaction or waiver of other customary closing conditions,
including the absence of a “Material Adverse Effect” (as defined in the Share Purchase Agreement) in respect of
Alliance and its subsidiaries. Akumin has obtained representations and warranties insurance on customary terms in
connection with the transaction. The Share Purchase Agreement provides for the payment by Akumin of a reverse
break fee to the Seller equal to: (a) 5.0% of the Purchase Price in connection with the termination of the Share
Purchase Agreement under certain circumstances, including a material breach by Akumin Corp. of any covenant,
representation or warranty contained in the Share Purchase Agreement; and (b) 2.5% of the Purchase Price in
connection with the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement because of a failure to obtain the HSR Clearance
by an agreed upon date. The Share Purchase Agreement also provides the Seller with the right to nominate a single
representative (the “Seller’s Nominee”) to the Board for so long as Seller owns at least 50% of the Share
Consideration, subject to certain conditions, including applicable securities law and stock exchange rules. The Seller
will also receive certain customary registration rights in connection with the transaction.

Subject to the satisfaction of all closing conditions, the Closing is expected to occur in the third quarter of 2021,
with an outside date of October 23, 2021, being 120 days from the date of the execution of the Share Purchase
Agreement (which outside date may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties for an additional 90 days).

**Summary of the Financings**

In connection with the Acquisition, we and Stonepeak have executed commitment documentation (the “Note
Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which, at the Closing:

(a) Stonepeak will purchase Financing Notes in a minimum of $200,000,000 and a maximum of $689,570,000
aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes of Akumin Corp. It is expected that, on the date of
the Closing, Akumin Corp. will issue $200,000,000 aggregate amount of Financing Notes (the “Initial
Financing Notes”). The Financing Notes will bear interest at 11.00% per annum, payable quarterly in cash;
provided, however, that, subject to certain conditions, Akumin Corp. will have the option for a two-year
period following the Closing to satisfy the payment of interest on any Financing Notes through a
combination of cash and/or via PIK. The Financing Notes will contain certain covenants similar to the
covenants in the Notes; provided, however, that the Financing Notes will contain restrictions on our ability
to, among other things, incur indebtedness in excess of a total leverage ratio of 4.5:1.0. See “Description of
Certain Other Indebtedness—The Financing Notes”;

(b) We will issue to Stonepeak 3,500,000 common shares of Akumin Inc. at the Issue Price for approximately
$10,430,000. Such common shares represent approximately 4.9% of the issued and outstanding common
shares of Akumin Inc. as of June 25, 2021; and

(c) We will issue to Stonepeak such number of Financing Warrants equal to 15% of the principal amount of
the Initial Financing Notes, divided by the Issue Price, such Financing Warrants having an exercise price
equal to the Issue Price and an expiry term of ten years from the date of issuance.


-----

The proceeds of this offering will reduce dollar-for-dollar the amount of the Stonepeak Note Commitment to be
issued by Akumin Corp. at the time of the Closing to a minimum of $200,000,000 aggregate principal amount of
Financing Notes. If this offering results in net proceeds consisting of an amount which is less than approximately
$489,570,000, then Akumin Corp. will issue to Stonepeak at Closing such aggregate principal amount of Financing
Notes as is required to complete the acquisition, up to $689,570,000.

To the extent the aggregate principal amount of the Initial Financing Notes is less than the maximum $689,570,000
principal amount of Financing Notes available for issuance at the Closing, such unused portion will remain available
to be issued by Akumin Corp. (the “Stonepeak Notes Commitment”), subject to the limitations in the covenants
pertaining to the Notes, the 2025 Senior Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility, for a three-year period following
the Closing, provided certain conditions are met. Any such future issuance of Financing Notes will be on the same
terms described above; provided, however, that the number of Financing Warrants that accompany such issuance of
Financing Notes will equal 20% of the dollar amount issued by Akumin Corp. divided by 120% of the 10day volume weighted average price of the Akumin Common Shares ending on the trading day immediately prior to
the earlier of the announcement or issuance of such Financing Warrants (the “Growth Equity Warrant Strike Price”),
and the exercise price for such additional Financing Warrants will be equal to the Growth Equity Warrant Strike
Price, subject to regulatory approval. The proceeds of any future issuance of Finance Notes will be used to finance
our organic growth as well as future merger and acquisition opportunities (unrelated to the Acquisition) that are
agreed to between Stonepeak and us.

At any time after seven years from the issuance date of any Financing Notes, Akumin Corp. may redeem any such
Financing Notes, in whole or in part, by paying in cash the principal amount and any accrued but unpaid interest, in
each case, plus 5%. To the extent that Akumin Corp. has not redeemed Financing Notes by the eleventh anniversary
of the issuance date of such Financing Notes, Akumin Corp. will be required to redeem: (a) 50% of such Financing
Notes (including any PIK amount) outstanding on the eleventh anniversary of such issuance date by paying in cash
the principal amount and any accrued but unpaid interest, in each case, plus 5%; and (b) the remaining balance
(including any PIK amount) by the twelfth anniversary of such issuance date by paying in cash the principal amount
and any accrued but unpaid interest, in each case, plus 5%.

A fee equal to approximately $14 million will be paid to Stonepeak in connection with the issuance of Initial
Financing Notes in the form of original issue discount on such notes.

The Note Purchase Agreement also provides Stonepeak with the right to nominate a single representative (the
“Stonepeak Nominee”) to the Board for so long as Stonepeak owns at least $100,000,000 of Financing Notes,
subject to certain conditions, including applicable securities law and stock exchange rules. Stonepeak will also
receive certain customary registration rights in connection with the transaction.


-----

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We estimate that our net proceeds from this offering, after deducting initial purchaser discounts and commissions,
will be approximately $       million. We intend to use such proceeds, as well as the proceeds from the Initial
Financing Notes, the Financing Common Shares and cash on hand to fund the cash portion of the purchase price for
the Acquisition of Alliance, which includes the repayment by the Seller of Alliance debt. Certain of the initial
purchasers and/or their respective affiliates who are holders of debt of Alliance may receive a portion of the
proceeds of this offering. The amounts set forth in the table and the accompanying footnotes will vary from actual
amounts on the closing date of the Acquisition depending on several factors, including differences between our
actual and estimated fees and expenses. You should read the following together with the information included under
the headings “The Transactions” and “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information”
included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

from this offering. If this offering results in net proceeds consisting of an amount which is less than approximately $489,570,000, then Akumin
Corp. will issue to Stonepeak at the Closing such principal amount of Financing Notes as is required to complete the acquisition, up to
$689,570,000. Following the Closing, Akumin Corp. will be permitted to issue to Stonepeak up to the amount of any undrawn Stonepeak
commitments to purchase Financing Notes for up to three years the proceeds of which will be used for future organic growth and acquisition
opportunities that are agreed by Stonepeak. We expect the aggregate principal amount of Financing Notes permitted to be issued by Akumin
Corp. after the Closing, assuming the issuance of $200 million in Initial Financing Notes, pursuant to the Stonepeak Notes Commitment, to
be approximately $489,570,000, subject to the covenants in the indenture that will govern the Notes, the 2025 Senior Notes Indenture, and
the Revolving Credit Facility. See “The Transactions” and “Description of Certain Other Indebtedness – the Financing Notes”.

On June 25, 2021, Akumin Inc. (“Akumin” or the “Company”) announced that it entered into a definitive purchase
agreement through one of its wholly own subsidiary to acquire Alliance HealthCare Services Inc. (“Alliance”) by
acquiring all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Alliance’s parent company, Thaihot Investment
Company US Limited, for a purchase price of $757.4 million plus the assumption of approximately $62.6 million of
Alliance’s outstanding equipment financing liabilities (the “Acquisition”). The Acquisition is expected to close in
the third quarter of 2021.

The unaudited pro forma combined financial information, which has been prepared in accordance with Article 11 of
Regulation S-X, is based on the respective historical consolidated financial statements of Akumin and Alliance
included elsewhere in this offering memorandum, and has been prepared to reflect the Acquisition and the financing
structure established to fund the Acquisition, more fully described in Note 2. The unaudited pro forma combined
statement of financial position has been prepared to give effect to the Acquisition and related financings as if they

year ended December 31, 2020 and for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020 assume that the
Acquisition and related financing arrangements were completed on January 1, 2020. Pro forma adjustments reflected
in the pro forma financial statements are based on available information and certain assumptions that Akumin
believes are reasonable and supportable, and do not reflect the cost of any integration activities or benefits from the
Acquisition, including potential synergies that may be derived in future periods. The pro forma financial statements
are presented for illustrative purposes only and do not necessarily reflect the actual results of operations of Akumin
had the Acquisition occurred at the dates indicated or project the results of operations of Akumin for any future date
or period.

**AKUMIN INC.**

**NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

**Note 1. Basis of presentation**

The pro forma combined financial statements are based on the respective historical consolidated financial statements
of Akumin and Alliance, and has been prepared to reflect the Acquisition and the financing structure established to
fund the Acquisition.

The unaudited pro forma combined statement of financial position has been prepared to give effect to the
Acquisition and related financing arrangements as if it was completed on March 31, 2021. The unaudited pro forma
combined statements of comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 and for the three months ended
March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020 assume that the Acquisition and related financing arrangements were
completed on January 1, 2020. Pro forma adjustments reflected in the pro forma financial statements are based on
available information and certain assumptions that Akumin believes are reasonable and supportable, and do not
reflect the cost of any integration activities or benefits from the Acquisition, including potential synergies that may
be derived in future periods. The pro forma financial statements are presented for illustrative purposes only and do
not necessarily reflect the actual results of operations of Akumin had the Acquisition occurred at the dates indicated
or project the results of operations of Akumin for any future date or period. The pro forma combined financial
statements have been prepared on the basis of the assumptions and adjustments described below and in subsequent
notes.

The pro forma financial statements were prepared using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with
ASC 805 Business Combinations, with Akumin being the legal and accounting acquirer of Alliance. Under the
acquisition method, the fair value of the purchase consideration, as well as the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed is based on valuation which involves judgment. Accordingly, the transaction accounting pro forma
adjustments have been recorded based on preliminary estimates of fair value, which have been made solely for the
purpose of preparing these pro forma financial statements. Actual fair value may vary from these preliminary
estimates and the differences could have a material impact on the accompanying pro forma financial statements and
Akumin’s future results of operations and financial position. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the final
allocation of the purchase price will not differ from the preliminary allocation reflected in the pro forma financial
statements. Additionally, since the Acquisition has not yet closed as of the date the pro forma financial statements
were prepared, it was necessary for Akumin’s management to make assumptions and estimates with respect to
certain elements of the source of financing. Actual composition and terms of the financing arrangements may differ
from management’s assumptions and estimates, which may also have a material impact on the accompanying pro
forma financial statements and Akumin’s future results of operations and financial position.

The pro forma adjustments are based upon the best available information and certain assumptions that Akumin
believes to be reasonable. The accounting policies used to compute the pro forma adjustments include all
adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the Acquisition in accordance with the recognition and
measurement principles of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP")
and incorporate the significant accounting policies expected to be used to prepare Akumin’s future consolidated
financial statements.

There are no material transactions undertaken between Akumin and Alliance during the periods presented in the pro
forma financial statements that would need to be eliminated.

Certain reclassifications have been made to Akumin’s and Alliance’s respective historical financial statements in
preparation of the pro forma financial statements to conform to the financial statement presentation expected to be
adopted post-closing of the Acquisition as described in the notes below.

Unless indicated otherwise in the notes to the pro forma financial statements, Akumin applied applicable enacted
statutory tax rates in 2021, and has used a tax rate of 26.5 percent to calculate the tax impact of the pro forma


-----

adjustments. These rates may be subject to change and may not be reflective of Akumin´s effective tax rate for
future periods after consummation of the Acquisition.

**Note 2. Financing of the Acquisition**

The total purchase price is expected to consist of:

1) $715.0 million – Cash;
2) $62.6 million – Assumption of Alliance’s existing capital leases and other debt-like obligations; and
3) $42.4 million – Issuance of Akumin common shares to the Seller, equal to 19.99% of Akumin’s issued and
outstanding common shares immediately prior to the signing of the definitive purchase agreement at $2.98
per share, which was priced on the basis of the volume-weighted average trading price of the common
shares on the NASDAQ for the five trading days ending on the trading day immediately prior to the signing
of the definitive purchase agreement.

Akumin intends to finance the $715 million cash purchase price payable on closing of the Acquisition as follows:

1) $492.5 million –Proceeds from the issuance of $500 million of Notes offered hereby, net of issuance costs;
2) $186.2 million of proceeds from the issuance of $200 million Series A Unsecured Notes due 2032/2033 to
Stonepeak, net of issuance costs, less $9.8 million cash commitment fees paid to Stonepeak for its $489.6
million additional capital commitment;

3) $10.2 million – Proceeds from the issuance of Akumin’s common shares to Stonepeak, net of issuance
costs;

4) $26.1 million – Cash on hand.

As a part of the issuance of Series A Unsecured Notes and the issuance of common shares to Stonepeak, Akumin
expects to issue to Stonepeak approximately 10,067,114 warrants to acquire Akumin’s common shares at the Issue
Price, expiring 10 years from the date of issuance.

**Note 3. Preliminary purchase price allocation**

The Acquisition will be accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting in
conformity with U.S. GAAP. Under this method, the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and non-controlling interest
of the acquiree have been recorded based on preliminary estimates of fair value. In the preliminary purchase price
allocation, the difference between the purchase consideration and book value of assets acquired and liabilities
assumed by Akumin was allocated based on management’s judgment and assumptions. Note that assets acquired
and liabilities assumed in the Acquisition exclude certain significant items reflected in Alliance’s historical
consolidated statement of financial position. The estimated fair value of the purchase consideration and the net
identifiable assets acquired are as follows:


-----

**(in US$0 00’)** **Fair value**

Accounts receivable .............................................................................. 70,292

Prepaid expenses and other current assets ............................................. 17,661

**Note 4. Pro forma adjustments – unaudited pro forma combined statement of financial position**

The pro forma adjustments are based on our preliminary estimates and assumptions that are subject to change. The
following adjustments have been reflected in the unaudited pro forma combined statement of financial position:

(a) **Purchase accounting using the acquisition method: Reflects the application of purchase accounting**
based on the preliminary purchase price allocation as shown in Note 3.

(b) **Issuance of the Notes: Reflects the issuance of the additional $500 million of Notes offered hereby to**
finance the Acquisition, net of issuance costs.

(c) **Transaction costs: As a result of the Acquisition, both Akumin and Alliance have incurred and will incur**
significant transaction costs. The adjustment reflects the accrual of expected total transaction costs that
have not been recognized in the historical financial statements. These costs mainly relate to internal and
external costs, including advisors’ fees, to prepare for and execute the Acquisition. Issuance costs of the
Series A Unsecured Notes due 2023/2033, the Notes and the equity raise have been recorded as a reduction
from the balances of long-term debt and common shares, respectively.

(d) **Issuance of Akumin’s common shares: Reflects the issuance of approximately 3.5 million Akumin’s**
common shares to Stonepeak at the Issue Price, net of cash issuance costs and issuance costs satisfied by
the issuance of warrants to purchase Akumin’s common shares (see Note 4(f) below).

(e) **Issuance of Series A Unsecured Notes: Reflects the issuance of $200 million Series A Unsecured Notes**
due 2032/2033 to Stonepeak to finance the Acquisition, net of cash issuance costs and issuance costs
satisfied by the issuance of warrants to purchase Akumin’s common shares (see Note 4(f) below).

(f) **Issuance of warrants to purchase Akumin’s common shares: Reflects the issuance of approximately**
10,067,114 warrants to purchase Akumin’s common shares to Stonepeak, in connection with the issuance
of the Series A Unsecured Notes and common shares as described in Notes 4(d) and 4(e) above. The
warrants are treated as issuance costs of the Series A Unsecured Notes and the common shares in
proportion to their respective fair value on the issuance date.

(g) **Commitment fees: In addition to the $200 million Series A Unsecured Notes issued to Stonepeak as**
described in note 4(e), Akumin has obtained an additional $489.6 million of capital commitment from
Stonepeak as a form of back-up financing in the event that the offering of the Notes is not completed at the
time the Acquisition closes. The adjustment reflects the 2% commitment fees paid to Stonepeak for
providing the additional capital commitment.

**Note 5. Pro forma adjustments – unaudited pro forma combined statement of comprehensive loss**

The pro forma adjustments are based on our preliminary estimates and assumptions that are subject to change. The
following adjustments have been reflected in the unaudited pro forma combined statement of comprehensive loss:

(a) **Depreciation and amortization of fair value increment: Reflects the incremental amortization of**
property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets as a result of the preliminary purchase price
allocation as illustrated in Note 3. Definite-lived intangible assets arising from the Acquisition include trade
name, customer relationships, and referral network. The depreciation of property and equipment is based on
estimated useful lives range from 5 to 10 years, and the amortization of intangible assets is based on
estimated useful lives of approximately 5 years.

(b) **Interest expense on Notes offered hereby: Reflects the net interest expense including amortization of**
issuance costs on the Notes offered hereby issued to finance the Acquisition at an assumed interest rate. If
the current interest rate on the additional Notes offered hereby increases or decreases by 0.125%, net
interest expense will increase or decrease by $625,000 per annum.

(c) **Reversal of interest expenses and related gains and losses on Alliance’s term loan and credit facilities:**
As Alliance’s term loan and credit facilities will not be assumed, related historical interest expenses have
been reversed, together with gains and losses from the debt modification as well as the remeasurement of
the related interest rate contracts.

(d) **Transaction costs: Estimated transaction costs associated with the Acquisition (see Note 4(c)) that have**
not been recognized in the historical statement of comprehensive income/loss have been recognized as a
pro forma adjustment for the year ended December 31, 2020, assuming the Acquisition consummated as of
January 1, 2020. Transaction costs included in the historical statement of comprehensive income/loss for
the three months ended March 31, 2021 have not been reversed.

(e) **Interest expense on Series A Unsecured Notes: Reflects the net interest expense including amortization**
of issuance costs on the Series A Unsecured Notes issued to Stonepeak.

(f) **Commitment fees: Commitment fees paid to Stonepeak for providing the $489.6 million additional capital**
commitment (see Note 4(g)) have been recognized as a pro forma adjustment for the year ended December
31, 2020, assuming the Acquisition consummated as of January 1, 2020.

(g) **Effect of income taxes: Reflects tax impact of pro forma adjustments to the statement of comprehensive**
income/loss, computed at Akumin’s statutory tax rate of 26.5%.

**Note 6: Accounting principles conformation**

Akumin adopted ASC 842 Leases (“ASC 842”) as of January 1, 2019, while Alliance has not adopted the
accounting standard due to its status as a non-public business entity as defined under U.S. GAAP. The adjustments
reflect the impact of adopting ASC 842 as of January 1, 2019 on Alliance’s historical statement of financial position,
which includes recognizing lease liabilities and right-of-use assets for all operating leases where Alliance is the
lessee. No adjustments are required on the unaudited pro forma combined statement of comprehensive loss, as the
requirements under ASC 842 are largely consistent with Alliance’s current accounting treatment with respect to rent
expenses. Please see below for a reconciliation from Alliance’s historical statement of financial position after
reclassifications made in Note 7 to Alliance’s historical statement of financial position as shown on the face of the
unaudited pro forma combined statement of financial position.

**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF**
**OPERATIONS - AKUMIN**

_You should read the following discussion of the results of operations and financial condition of Akumin together_
_with the financial statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. Amounts stated in_
_this section, including RVUs and dollar amounts, are in thousands, unless otherwise stated. The information in this_
_“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” is presented on a_
_historical standalone basis without giving any pro forma effect to the Acquisition._

**Overview**

We are a provider of outpatient diagnostic imaging services in the United States, with freestanding centers located
across Florida, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Texas, Georgia, Illinois and Kansas. Our centers provide physicians with
imaging capabilities to facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of diseases and disorders and may reduce unnecessary
invasive procedures, minimizing the cost and amount of care for patients. Our services include magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), ultrasound, X-ray,
mammography and other diagnostic or interventional radiology procedures.

We seek to develop leading positions in regional markets in order to leverage operational efficiencies. Our scale and
density within selected geographies in the United States provides for long-term relationships with key payors,
radiology groups and referring physicians. Our operations team is responsible for managing relationships with local
physicians and payors, meeting our standards of patient service and improving profitability. We provide corporate
training programs, standardized policies and procedures and sharing of best practices among the physicians in our
regional networks.

**Summary of Factors Affecting Our Performance**

**_Number of Clinics_**

We have a meaningful opportunity to continue to grow the number of our diagnostic imaging facilities in the United
States through organic and non-organic growth. The opening and success of new facilities is subject to many factors,
including our ability to finance acquisitions, build relationships with referring doctors in new regions, and negotiate
suitable lease terms for new locations, among other factors, some of which are beyond our control.

The following table shows the number of our diagnostic imaging facilities as at each given date:

**As at**

**As at** **As at** **As at** **As at** **Dec 31,**
**Mar 31, 2021** **Dec 31, 2020** **Dec 31, 2019** **Dec 31, 2018** **2017**

Number of Diagnostic Imaging Facilities ...... 127 127 129 96 74

During the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2020, we permanently closed two centers in Texas, one center
in Pennsylvania, and one center in Delaware. We completed the acquisition of two individual centers, one in Illinois
and one in Florida, on January 1, 2020. The operations of those closed centers were consolidated into neighboring
centers. While the COVID-19 pandemic may have accelerated the closure of these centers, management views the
closure of these centers as being in the ordinary course of operations.

**_Competition_**

The market for diagnostic imaging services is highly competitive. We compete principally on the basis of our
reputation, our ability to provide multiple modalities at many of our facilities, the location of our facilities and the
quality of our diagnostic imaging services. In the markets in which we are operating, or anticipate operating, we
compete locally with groups of radiologists, established hospitals, clinics and other independent organizations that
own and operate imaging equipment.

We also face competition from other diagnostic imaging companies and investors in acquiring diagnostic imaging
centers, which makes it more difficult to find attractive acquisition targets on favorable terms.


-----

Our multi-modality imaging offering provides a one-stop-shop for patients and referring physicians and diversifies
our revenue sources. Our scalable and integrated operating platform is expected to create value from future
acquisitions, cost efficiencies, and organic growth.

**_Industry Trends_**

Our revenue is impacted by changes to U.S. healthcare laws, our partners’ and contractors’ healthcare costs, and/or
reimbursement rates by payors.

**How We Assess the Performance of Our Business**

The key performance indicator measures below are used by management in evaluating the performance of and
assessing our business. We refer to certain key performance indicators used by management and typically used by
our competitors in the diagnostic imaging industry, certain of which are not recognized under GAAP.

**_GAAP Measures_**

_Revenue. Our revenue is comprised of service fee revenue and other revenue. The following is a brief description of_
the components of our revenue:

  - Service fee revenue is recorded during the period in which our performance obligations are satisfied, based
on the estimated collectible amounts from the patients and third-party payors. Our performance obligations
are satisfied when services are rendered to the patient. Since the gap between payment and delivery of
services to patients is generally expected to be less than one year, we do not adjust the service fee revenue
for a significant financing component, as a practical expedient. Third-party payors include federal and state
agencies (under the Medicare and Medicaid programs), managed care health plans, commercial insurance
companies, attorneys, and employers. Estimates of contractual allowances and the transaction price are
based on the terms specified in the related contractual agreements, negotiated rates and historical and
expected payment patterns. We estimate its expected reimbursement for patients based on the applicable
contract terms and negotiated rates. We believe its review process enables us to identify instances on a
timely basis where such estimates need to be revised.

  - Other revenue consists of miscellaneous fees under contractual arrangements, including service fee revenue
under capitation arrangements with third-party payors, management fees, government grants and fees for
other services provided to third parties. Revenue is recorded during the period in which our performance
obligations under the contract are satisfied by us.

_Other GAAP measures. The management also uses net income attributable to shareholders of Akumin in evaluating_
the performance of and assessing our business.

**_Non-GAAP Measures_**

We make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. For a discussion on how we utilize non-GAAP measures, see
the section above under the heading “Non-GAAP Measures”. For a reconciliation of Non-GAAP measures to the
most directly comparable GAAP financial performance measure, see “Summary—Summary Consolidated Historical
and Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information and Other Data – Akumin.”

**Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results**

**_Acquisition Activity_**

The timing of acquisitions and the opening of new facilities impacts our revenue and the comparability of our results
from period to period.

**_Newly Adopted Accounting Standards_**

As noted below, we adopted GAAP as the basis of preparation for our December 31, 2020 consolidated financial
statements. Please refer to note 18 of our December 31, 2020 consolidated financial statements for discussion of

93


-----

standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuances of the consolidated
financial statements.

**_Segments_**

We identify our reporting segments based on the organizational units used by management to monitor performance
and make operating decisions. We have identified one operating segment: outpatient diagnostic medical imaging
services.

**_GAAP Adoption_**

We adopted GAAP as the basis of preparation for the 2020 Annual Financial Statements effective for the fiscal yearended December 31, 2020. Previously, our financial statements were prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”), for
the period up to and including the 9-months ended September 30, 2020. On August 28, 2020, we filed a Form 40F with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. This filing resulted in us becoming an “SEC Issuer” for purposes of National Instrument 51102 — Continuous Disclosure Obligations and as such we are entitled to prepare and report its financial statements
in GAAP as opposed to IFRS.

**_COVID-19_**

Commencing during the three-month period ended March 31, 2020, and continuing through the present and beyond,
a pandemic relating to the novel coronavirus known as COVID-19 occurred causing significant financial market
disruption and social dislocation. The pandemic is dynamic, with various cities, counties, states and countries around
the world responding or having responded in different ways to address and contain the outbreak, including the
declaration of a global pandemic by the World Health Organization, a National State of Emergency in the United
States and state and local executive orders and ordinances forcing the closure of non-essential businesses and
persons not employed in or using essential services to “stay at home” or “shelter in place”. At this stage, we have no
certainty as to how long the pandemic, or a more limited epidemic, will last, what regions will be most affected, to
what extent containment measures will be applied, or the nature and timing of possible vaccinations. Imaging
centers are healthcare facilities, and are generally considered an essential service with the expectation that they
continue to operate during the pandemic. However, actions taken by government, referring physicians or
individuals, in response to containment or avoidance of COVID-19 may impact a patient’s ability or decision to seek
imaging services at a given time. Such actions may have a significant impact on volume at our imaging centers
leading to temporary or prolonged staff layoffs, reduced hours, closures and other cost containment efforts. Further,
there is the potential that certain non-urgent services that may be deferred without significant harm to a patient’s
health may be delayed, either by us in response to local laws or public health guidance or voluntarily by the patient.
In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic may impact supply chains, including our supply of personal protective
equipment, and lead to personnel shortages, each of which could impact our ability to safely perform imaging
services. It is also possible that social distancing efforts and sanitization and decontamination procedures could
cause delays in the performance of imaging services. Depending on the severity and duration of the COVID19 pandemic, we may incur incremental credit losses beyond what is currently expected, reduced revenue and
income and asset impairments.

We instituted several realignment and cost containment measures to respond to the drop in volume that resulted
from the COVID-19 pandemic and related government orders. In March 2020, we announced the realignment of our
operational resources to dedicate certain imaging centers to focus on patients showing active symptoms of COVID19 in an effort to better allocate resources and respond to public health needs associated with the COVID19 pandemic.

Our cost containment measures included the temporary closure of 17 of our imaging centers to consolidate volume
to nearby centers and reduced operating hours at the remainder of our imaging centers, with highest number of
centers closed in mid-April, 2020. At that same time, we furloughed or laid off nearly 29% of our workforce,
reduced work hours for our hourly personnel and reduced salaries by up to 20%, as well as negotiated deferral of
certain costs due to landlords and other vendors.

94


-----

In light of the improving business environment for us, reflected by increases in RVUs volume in the third and fourth
quarters of 2020, without contribution from new acquisitions (please refer “Selected Financial Information” below),
we gradually increased our workforce throughout the first quarter 2021 (though total personnel remained below preCOVID-19 levels through to the end of the first quarter 2021). Effective January 1, 2021, all reduced salaries had
been returned to normal levels. Clinical operations have resumed to normal operating hours as patient volumes allow
and substantially all of the clinics that had temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic have resumed normal
operations. If the future economic or legislative environment related to the COVID-19 pandemic again leads to
weakened business volume, we might re-institute cost containment measures similar to those described above in
order to preserve our liquidity.

We did not alter our capital expenditure plans in 2020 or in the three months ended March 31, 2021 as a result of the
pandemic in any material manner.

Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have increased the frequency of disinfecting our clinical areas, with a
focus on “high touch” areas, procured increased inventories of personal protective equipment (such as masks,
gowns, and gloves) and took precautions to follow guidance from the Centers for Disease Control (or CDC) and
relevant state health departments in our clinics and corporate offices. To date, we have generally been able to
procure enough personal protective equipment to meet our requirements.

As noted below, in November 2020, we issued the 2025 Senior Notes to refinance our variable interest rate longterm debt. This reduced interest rate risk for us which could have otherwise negatively affected us during the
pandemic. As of December 31, 2020, our cost of capital has not been negatively affected due to COVID-19.

Finally, as further described below, we received grant funds in April 2020, December 2020 and April 2021 from
Health and Human Services and advanced payments in April 2020 from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services, both of which were made available under U.S. federal government stimulus made available pursuant to the
CARES Act.

**_Government Payments_**

In April 2020, we received approximately $1.1 million under the first appropriation made by HHS to Medicare
providers pursuant to the CARES Act. Subsequently, in December 2020, we received an additional grant from the
HHS of approximately $4.1 million and in April 2021, we received an additional grant from the HHS of
approximately $0.8 million. Additional grants may be available to us through subsequent appropriations under this
program. We applied for these grants after determining that we were eligible to do so and have incurred expenses
and experienced loss of revenue that are eligible to be reimbursed under these grants. The grants received are
recorded in the consolidated statements of operations comprehensive income (loss) in the category “Other revenue”.

In April 2020, we received approximately $3.1 million of accelerated Medicare payments under the expanded
Accelerated and Advance Payments Program from CMS. These payments are currently required to be repaid
beginning one year after their receipt, being in or about April 2021, through the adjudication of Medicare claims
over a future period. These payments to us are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets in the category “Accounts
payable and accrued liabilities” until earned.

**_Financing Transactions_**

On November 2, 2020, we closed our previously announced private offering of $400 million of aggregate principal
amount of 2025 Senior Notes. The net proceeds from this offering were used to repay in full the Amended May
2019 Loans (as defined below) and the net derivative financial instrument liabilities and to pay related financing fees
and expenses. The balance was retained as cash. The 2025 Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed,
jointly and severally, on a senior secured basis by us and each of our direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries,
including professional service affiliates of ours.

Concurrently with the closing of the 2025 Senior Notes, we entered into the Revolving Credit Agreement. See
“Description of Certain Other Indebtedness”.

95


-----

On February 11, 2021 we completed a private offering of $75 million aggregate principal amount of additional 2025
Senior Notes.

We have applied part of the net proceeds from the 2025 Senior Notes for acquisitions and expect to use the balance
of the net proceeds for future acquisitions, with any unused proceeds to be used for working capital and other
general corporate purposes, which may include reducing debt.

The availability of borrowings under the Revolving Facility is subject to customary terms and conditions. As of
March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, we had no drawdowns on the new revolving credit facility.

**_Investment in Artificial Intelligence Business_**

Effective March 1, 2021, we completed a common equity investment in an artificial intelligence business as part of a
private placement offering for approximately $4.6 million. The target develops artificial intelligence aided software
programs for use in medical businesses, including outpatient imaging services of the sort provided by us. As a result
of the investment, a previous investment in a convertible note instrument issued by the target to us in May 2020
converted to common equity. Our total investment is estimated to be valued at approximately $8.0 million and
represents a 34.5% interest in the target on a non-diluted basis. In addition, we hold share purchase warrants which,
subject to the occurrence of certain events and certain assumptions, and the payment of approximately $0.4 million,
would entitle us to acquire a further 2.4% interest in the target’s common equity.

**_ADG Acquisition Earn-out_**

On November 2, 2020, we reached a settlement with the sellers of its Georgia business pursuant to the process
contemplated by the purchase agreement for that business which valued the ADG Acquisition Earn-out (as defined
below) at approximately $9.4 million. In accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement between the parties,
50% of the value of ADG Acquisition Earn-out (approximately $4.7 million) was paid within five business days
after the value was finally determined on November 9, 2020. The remaining balance was paid on May 10, 2021.

**_Volume and revenue. RVUs related to service fee revenues in the year ended December 31, 2020 were 5,641 (in_**
thousands) compared to 5,247 in the year ended December 31, 2019. Excluding or pro rating for the contribution of
acquisitions, on a same-center basis, RVUs were 4,635 in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 5,203 in
the year ended December 31, 2019, which represents a decrease of approximately 11%.

In the fourth quarter of 2020, due to slow down in collections of receivables, we changed our estimates of the
implicit price concessions related to its customers, primarily based on historical experience of collections impacted
by the pandemic and the integration of diagnostic imaging centers acquired in 2018 and 2019. The result of this
change in estimate resulted in an increase as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 to the cumulative
implicit price concessions for outstanding receivables by approximately $12.3 million ($9.4 million net of tax) in the
year ended 2020.

Revenue was $251,283 and $247,436 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The variance is
mainly due to the 2019 Acquisitions and 2020 Acquisitions and HHS grants received under the CARES Act of
$5,126, partly offset by lower same-center volume (approximately 11% as compared to approximately 8% increase
in overall volume due to 2019 Acquisitions and 2020 Acquisitions) and lower service fee revenue per RVU
(approximately 7%; it includes the impact of the above noted $12.3 million in implicit price concessions). The lower
volume is due to the current economic environment, which lessened demand for imaging services as a result of
the COVID-19 pandemic and related government “stay-at-home” orders and other restrictions, as well as patients
deferring elective procedures, which would have required our imaging services, due to the pandemic. The lower
service fee revenue per RVU resulted from increased implicit price concessions and payor and service mix. In
response to decreased demand during 2020, management implemented temporary site closures of 17 locations and
reduced operating hours for certain sites. In light of the improving business environment for us, we have since
reopened most of our temporarily closed imaging centers and increased our operating hours. Going forward, we
expect organic growth to improve, however, the COVID-19 pandemic may result in the fluctuation of organic
growth rates over time.

In the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 10% of service fee revenue was earned from attorney payors,
compared to approximately 6% in the year ended December 31, 2019.

**_Employee compensation. Payroll and staffing costs, as a percentage of revenue, decreased from 35% to 33% in the_**
year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease, as a percentage of
revenue, is mainly attributable to the 2019 Acquisitions and 2020 Acquisitions and cost control measures taken in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and HHS grants received. Expenses for employee compensation for the year
ended December 31, 2020 were down $1,862 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 as expenses related to
growth from 2019 Acquisitions were offset by furloughs, layoffs and salary cuts as part of our cost containment
measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

**_Reading fees. Reading fees, as a percentage of revenue, increased from 14% to 15% in the year ended December 31,_**
2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase, as a percentage of revenue, is due to increased
implicit price concessions, partly offset by HHS grants received. Our reading fees are largely based on the volume
of procedures performed. As a result, reading fee expenses are variable and closely tied to revenue.

**_Rent and utilities. Rent and utilities, as a percentage of revenue, increased from 11% to 12% in the year ended_**
December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase, as a percentage of revenue, is
due to increased implicit price concessions, relatively lower volume due to weaker economic environment and the

97


-----

relatively fixed nature of rent and utilities expense, partly offset by HHS grants received. Rent and utilities expenses
for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $3,871 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 mainly
due to the timing of 2019 Acquisitions and 2020 Acquisitions.

**_Third party services and professional fees. Third party services and professional fees, as a percentage of revenue,_**
increased from 8% to 9% in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
The increase, as a percentage of revenue, is mainly due to increased implicit price concessions, partly offset by HHS
grants received.

**_Administrative expenses, medical supplies and other expenses. Administrative expenses, medical supplies and_**
other expenses, as a percentage of revenue, increased from 9% to 10% in the year ended December 31, 2020
compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase, as a percentage of revenue, is mainly due to increased
implicit price concessions, partly offset by HHS grants received. Administrative expenses, medical supplies and
other expenses increased by approximately $2,795 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year
ended December 31, 2019, due to timing of the 2019 Acquisitions and 2020 Acquisitions, additional medical
supplies expenses incurred for the purchase of personal protective equipment as part of our response to the COVID19 pandemic as well as additional director and officer insurance premium costs related to having become a registrant
with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, all partially offset our cost containment measures
implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

**_Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $53,704 compared to $59,815 for_**
the year ended December 31, 2019. The variance is mainly attributable to the negative impact on our business
volume of COVID-19 starting in March 2020, increased implicit price concessions, partly offset by the 2019
Acquisitions, 2020 Acquisitions and HHS grants received. As a result, Adjusted EBITDA Margin for the year ended
December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, decreased from 24% to 21%. For a
reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income see “Summary Pro Forma and Historical Consolidated
_Financial Information and Other Data – Akumin.”_

**_Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Akumin. The net loss attributable to shareholders of Akumin was_**
$20,398 (8% of revenue) for the year ended December 31, 2020 and net income for the year ended December 31,
2019 was $9,428 (4% of revenue). This decrease in net income is mainly due to relatively lower volume due to
weaker economic environment, an $18 million loss on extinguishment of the Amended May 2019 Loans (as defined
below) and additional implicit price concessions to revenue (as described above), partly offset by the timing of the
above noted 2019 Acquisitions and 2020 Acquisitions, cost control measures and approximately $5.1 million in
HHS grants received.

**_Volume and revenue. We report the measurement of volume of diagnostic imaging procedures at our_**
facilities based on RVUs. RVUs are a standardized measure of value used in the United States Medicare
reimbursement formula for physician services. RVUs related to service fee revenues in the three-month period
ended March 31, 2021 were 1,515 (in thousands) compared to 1,525 in the three-month period ended March 31,
2020. On a same-center basis, RVUs were 1,504 in the three-month period ended March 31, 2021 compared to
1,518 in the three-month period ended March 31, 2020, which represents a decrease of approximately 1%. This
represents a significant recovery from a same-center basis decline of 30% in the three-month period ended June 30,
2020.

Revenue was $66,889 and $71,262 for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2021 and 2020,
respectively. The variance is mainly due to lower volume (approximately 1% overall as compared to 1% decline on
a same-center basis) and lower service fee revenue per RVU (approximately 5% lower). The lower volume is due to
the current economic environment and reduced demand for imaging services as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic
and related government “stay-at-home” orders and other restrictions, as well as patients deferring elective
procedures, which would have required our imaging services, due to the pandemic. The lower service fee revenue
per RVU mainly resulted from payor and service mix. Going forward, we expect organic growth to improve,
however, the COVID-19 pandemic may result in fluctuation of organic growth rates over time.

In the three-month period ended March 31, 2021, approximately 10% of service fee revenue was earned from
attorney payors, compared to approximately 9% in the three-month period ended March 31, 2020.

**_Employee compensation. Payroll and staffing costs, as a percentage of revenue, remained consistent at 35%_**
in the three-month period ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three-month period ended March 31, 2020.
Expenses for employee compensation were approximately $1,700 lower for the three-month period ended March 31,
2021 compared to the three-month period ended March 31, 2020 due mainly to our cost containment measures in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

**_Reading fees. Reading fees, as a percentage of revenue, remained consistent at 15% in the three-month_**
period ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three-month period ended March 31, 2020. Our reading fees are
largely based on the volume of procedures performed. As a result, reading fee expenses are variable and closely
correlated to revenue.

**_Rent and utilities. Rent and utilities, as a percentage of revenue, remained consistent at 11% in the three-_**
month period ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three-month period ended March 31, 2020. Rent and utilities
expenses for the three-month period ended March 31, 2021 were broadly comparable to the three-month period
ended March 31, 2020.

**_Third party services and professional fees. Third party services and professional fees, as a percentage of_**
revenue, decreased from 9% to 8% in the three-month period ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three-month

period ended March 31, 2020. The decrease, as a percentage of revenue, is mainly due to cost containment
measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

**_Administrative expenses, medical supplies and other expenses. Administrative expenses, medical supplies_**
and other expenses, as a percentage of revenue, remained consistent at 10% in the three-month period ended March
31, 2021 compared to the three-month period ended March 31, 2020. Administrative expenses, medical supplies
and other expenses decreased by approximately $22 for the three-month period ended March 31, 2021 compared to
the three-month period ended March 31, 2020.

**_Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for the three-month period ended March 31, 2021 was $13,758_**
compared to $14,968 for the three-month period ended March 31, 2020. The variance is mainly attributable to lower
revenue, partly offset by reduction in operating expenses. Adjusted EBITDA Margin for the three-month periods
ended March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020 was 21%. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income see
"Summary Pro Forma and Historical Consolidated Financial Information and Other Data - Akumin".

**_Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Akumin. The net income attributable to shareholders of_**
Akumin was $681 (1% of revenue) for the three-month period ended March 31, 2021 and net income for the threemonth period ended March 31, 2020 was $2,235 (3% of revenue). The decrease in net income is mainly due to lower
revenue as noted above.

(1) Total debt consists of borrowings under the 2025 Senior Notes, senior debt incurred in May 2019 (and repaid using the
proceeds of the 2025 Senior Notes), Wesley Chapel Loan (as defined below), subordinated note-earn-out (paid in 2020),
derivative financial instrument liabilities and leases (including finance leases and operating leases), including both the
current and non-current portions.

Cash was $122,725 as at March 31, 2021, an increase of $78,329, as compared to $44,396 as at December
31, 2020. The increase in cash during the three-month period ended March 31, 2021 was due to $10,249 from
operating activities and $76,341 from financing activities, partly offset by $8,261 used in investing activities.

Accounts receivable were $95,886 as at March 31, 2021, an increase of $4,759, as compared to $91,127 as at
December 31, 2020. We do not consider the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic material to our cash collections.
However, from March 2020 through March 2021, our cash collections were impacted by COVID-19 in the
following ways:

     - Paper-filing payors (which represent a small proportion of our payors as opposed to electronic filing
payors) were temporarily delayed due to work-from-home staff’s inability to process paperwork;

     - Our internal and external billing resources were temporarily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic,
resulting in lower than usual available personnel;

100


-----

     - Payments from attorney payors were lower due to delays in court hearings caused by courthouse
closures or deferrals of court cases, and by “stay-at-home” and similar orders;

     - We believe, certain smaller payors may be delaying payments in order to manage their own cash
flows during the pandemic.

We have a diverse mix of payors, including private, managed care, capitated and government payors. Credit
risk arises from the potential a counterparty will fail to perform its obligations. We are exposed to credit risk from
our payors but the concentration of the risk is minimized because of the large customer base and its dispersion
across different payors.

Collectability of the receivables is actively monitored on an ongoing basis and an allowance or a write-off of
allowance for bad debts is established by management. At each reporting period, we determine whether an
allowance or write-off is required by estimating the expected credit losses based on a combination of probabilityweighted historic and actual bad debts experience with consideration of forward-looking information including
changes to economic conditions that would impact its customers (such as unemployment rate and general economic
environment for non-individual payors). During the period affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, management’s
consideration of those changes to economic conditions included the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The aging
of our receivables, net of allowances, is as follows.

Property and equipment and operating leases right-of-use assets were $203,813 as at March 31, 2021, a
decrease of $3,178, as compared to $206,991 as at December 31, 2020. This decrease is mainly attributable to
additions to right of use assets ($656), and capital expenditures ($4,296), offset by depreciation ($7,703) and net
disposals ($427).

Intangible assets were $6,098 as at March 31, 2021, a decrease of $650, as compared to $6,748 as at
December 31, 2020. This decrease is mainly due to amortization recorded in the period.

Goodwill was $360,604 as at March 31, 2021, unchanged from December 31, 2020.

Total debt (excluding operating lease liabilities) was $483,387 as at March 31, 2021, an increase of $77,828
as compared to $405,559 as at December 31, 2020. This increase is attributable to gross proceeds under the 2025
Senior Notes ($78,750) and related non-cash interest accretion ($379), partly offset by decrease in finance lease
liabilities ($77), loan repayments ($99), and debt issuance costs incurred ($1,125).

Our shareholders’ equity attributable to shareholders of Akumin Inc. was $135,313 as at March 31, 2021, an
increase of $1,107 as compared to $134,206 as at December 31, 2020. This increase is due to net income of $681
during the three-month period ended March 31, 2021 and stock-based compensation of $427.

Non-controlling interests were $5,530 as at March 31, 2021, an increase of $4, as compared to $5,526 as at
December 31, 2020. In the three-month period ended March 31, 2021, net income attributable to the non-controlling
interests was $453, partly offset by distributions of $449.

During the quarterly periods presented above, we experienced significant growth through acquisitions. The quarterto-quarter results have been impacted by the timing of these acquisitions as well as generally weaker business
environment since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

**_General_**

Our objective is to maintain a capital structure that supports our long-term growth strategy, maintains creditor and
customer confidence, and maximizes shareholder value.

Our capital structure consists of our capital stock, contributed surplus and debt.

Our primary uses of capital are to finance operations, increase non-cash working capital and capital expenditures.
Our objectives when managing capital are to ensure we will continue to have sufficient liquidity so we can provide
our services to our customers and returns to our shareholders. As we have primarily grown through acquisitions, we
have raised debt and equity to partly finance such transactions. The details regarding any such issuances during the
three-month period ended March 31, 2021 are noted in our condensed interim consolidated Financial Statements for
the three-month period ended March 31, 2021.

As at March 31, 2021, we had cash of $122,725. As at March 31, 2021, our working capital (currents assets
excluding cash, less accounts payable and accrued liabilities) was $55,430 (2020; $60,836). The decrease in
working capital was mainly due to the accrued interest expense on the 2025 Senior Notes during the three-month
period ended March 31, 2021. This interest expense is paid every six months. During the three-month period ended
March 31, 2021, we did not enter into any material deferral payment arrangements with our vendors due to COVID19.

As at March 31, 2021, we had $467,890 of senior loans payable. As of March 31, 2021, $411 of these liabilities are
due within one year. As at March 31, 2021, substantially all of our assets were pledged as security for senior loans.
Under the 2025 Senior Notes, there are no maintenance financial covenants, rather there are incurrence-based
covenants.

As at March 31, 2021, we had operating lease liabilities of $130,281, consisting mainly of leases with remaining
term of more than one year, primarily for office space. As of March 31, 2021, $9,417 of these liabilities are due
within one year. As at March 31, 2021, we had finance lease liabilities of $15,497. As of March 31, 2021, $3,432 of
these liabilities are due within one year. We believe we are in compliance with the terms of our leases in all material
respects.

We believe that our current sources of liquidity and capital will be sufficient to finance our continued operations,
growth strategy and additional expenses we expect to incur for at least the next 12 months. Historically, we have
financed our growth through acquisitions via both privately issued capital in the equity and/or debt capital markets
and publicly issued equity, and we expect to continue to do so. We expect to gain additional access to the public
equity and/or debt capital markets to support our growth strategy. There can be no assurance, however, that our
business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available under our
credit facility or otherwise to enable us to service our indebtedness, or to make capital expenditures in the future.
Our future operating performance and our ability to service or extend our indebtedness will be subject to future
economic conditions and to financial, business, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.

**Lending Arrangements and Debt**

See “Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results—Financing Transactions.”

**_Wesley Chapel Loan_**

We, through a subsidiary, have a purchase money secured loan (the “Wesley Chapel Loan”) having a face value of
$2,000 as of August 15, 2018 which has been used to finance the purchase of equipment and related installation at a

102


-----

clinic location near Tampa Bay, Florida. It has an annual interest rate of 5.0%, matures on August 15, 2023, has
monthly repayments of $38 and is secured only against the equipment financed. The Wesley Chapel Loan was
recognized at fair value of $1,908 on August 15, 2018 using an effective interest rate. As of March 31, 2021, the
face value of the Wesley Chapel Loan was $1,029 (amortized cost of $985).

**_Subordinated Note – Earn-out_**

As part of an acquisition, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of ours assumed a subordinated 6% note and security
agreement with the seller’s secured lender on May 11, 2018 (the “Subordinated Note”) with a face value of $1,500
and a term of four years. The Subordinated Note was recognized at fair value of $1,491 on May 11, 2018 using an
effective interest rate. Interest on the Subordinated Note is accrued and added to the principal amount on each
anniversary of the Subordinated Note agreement.

In accordance with the terms of the Subordinated Note, we used part of the proceeds of the Term Loans to settle the
principal outstanding under Subordinated Note on May 31, 2019 together with accrued and unpaid interest, for
$1,596 (face value of $1,500 and accrued interest of $96). We also recorded a fair value loss of $7 on the
extinguishment of the Subordinated Note, which was reflected in the consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive income (loss).

The principal balance of the Subordinated Note was subject to increase by an earn-out (the “Subordinated Note

**- Earn-out”) of up to an additional $4.0 million during the three-calendar year period beginning on January 1, 2019**
and ending on December 31, 2021, subject to the satisfaction of certain revenue-based milestones. Management
estimated the fair value of the Subordinated Note – Earn-out as at May 11, 2018 of $161. The Subordinated Note

- Earn-out was revalued at $200 as at September 30, 2020 and the change in fair value was recognized in the
consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). We entered into a settlement with the
holders of the Subordinated Note – Earn-out to fully settle and terminate the Subordinated Note – Earn-out for $200
on October 23, 2020.

**_ADG Acquisition Earn-out_**

A portion of the purchase price payable in respect of the acquisition of our Georgia business on May 31, 2019, was
subject to an earn-out (the “ADG Acquisition Earn-out”) based on our annualized revenues earned in the first two
quarters of 2020 less certain costs including certain operating expenses, capital expenditures and incremental
working capital.

Management estimated the fair value of the ADG Acquisition Earn-out liability as at the acquisition date at
approximately $14.7 million based on a discount rate of approximately 7% and management’s estimated probability
weighted range of the ADG Acquisition – Earn-out liability. Subsequently, the ADG Acquisition Earn-out liability
estimate was revalued at approximately $14.8 million as at December 31, 2019, approximately $8.3 million as at
March 31, 2020 and at approximately $6.2 million as at June 30, 2020. The respective changes in fair value were
recognized in financial instruments revaluation in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive
income (loss). During 2020, this liability was revalued at approximately $9.4 million based on a settlement reached
in pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement with the representatives of the sellers of our Georgia business and
the change in fair value was recognized in financial instruments revaluation in the consolidated statements of
operations and comprehensive income (loss). Fifty percent of this liability was paid in November 2020 and the
balance was paid in May 2021 pursuant to the process outlined in the related purchase agreement. During the
twelve-month period ended December 31, 2020, we recognized a gain of approximately $5.5 million due to changes
in fair value of the ADG Acquisition Earn-out liability (2019 – loss of approximately $0.1 million).

**Financial Instruments**

Our financial instruments at March 31, 2021 consisted of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued
liabilities, 2025 Senior Notes, Wesley Chapel Loan, ADG Acquisition Earn-out, and leases. The fair values of these
financial instruments, except the 2025 Senior Notes, Wesley Chapel Loan, and ADG Acquisition Earnout, approximate carrying value because of their short-term nature. The carrying value of the non-current portion of
leases approximates their fair value given the difference between the discount rates used to recognize the liabilities
in the consolidated balance sheets and the normalized expected market rates of interest is insignificant. Effective
November 14, 2018, we entered into a derivative financial instrument contract with a financial institution to mitigate
interest rate risk under the variable interest rate Syndicated Loans. The derivative financial instrument is an interest
rate cap rate of 3.75% (LIBOR) per annum on a notional amount of 50% of the face value of the Syndicated Term
Loan ($50,000 as of November 14, 2018). The termination date of this arrangement is August 31, 2021. This
derivative financial instrument was terminated and settled completely on November 2, 2020.

Effective July 31, 2019, we entered into an interest rate collar contract most recently amended in February 2020,
with a financial institution in order to mitigate interest rate risk under the Amended May 2019 Loans. This
derivative financial instrument has an underlying notional amount of 100% of the face value of Term Loan B
($266,000 as at July 31, 2019) and a termination date of July 31, 2022 with (i) a cap rate of 3.00% (LIBOR) per
annum and (ii) a floor rate of 1.1475% (LIBOR) per annum. This derivative financial instrument was terminated and
settled completely on November 2, 2020.

Financial assets measured at amortized cost include cash and accounts receivable. Financial liabilities measured at
amortized cost include accounts payable and accrued liabilities, leases, 2025 Senior Notes and Wesley Chapel Loan.
Amortization is recorded using the effective interest rate method. We classified the derivative financial instruments
as financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. We classified the Subordinated Note – Earnout and ADG Acquisition Earn-out, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. The Subordinated Note
– Earn-out was terminated and settled completely on October 23, 2020 for a payment of $200. During 2020, the
value of the ADG Acquisition Earn-out was determined to be $9.4 million and was paid and satisfied in accordance
with the underlying agreement as discussed above.

Our financial instruments are exposed to certain financial risks including credit risk, currency risk and interest rate
risk. Refer to note 12 of our condensed interim consolidated Financial Statements for the three-month period ended
March 31, 2021 for further discussion regarding risk management arising from financial instruments. There have
been no significant changes in the composition of our financial instruments since December 31, 2020.

**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**

We have not engaged in any off-balance sheet financing transactions except for letters of credit of approximately
$100 as at March 31, 2021. The letters of credit provide security to certain landlords for our obligations under
certain real estate leases. The letters of credit are cash collateralized with the financial institutions that issued the
letters of credit.

**Related Party Transactions**

In the normal course of business, we engage in transactions with our wholly owned and controlled subsidiaries.
Balances and transactions between us and our wholly owned and controlled subsidiaries have been eliminated on
consolidation in our consolidated financial statements.

We transact with key individuals from management who have the authority to plan, direct, and control our activities,
including through employment agreements and stock-based compensation plans. Key management personnel are
defined as our executive officers and the board of directors, including the President and Chief Executive Officer,

104


-----

Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Secretary and Senior
Vice Presidents.

On November 1, 2020, we acquired for $400 an MRI machine from an entity in which an officer of a subsidiary of
ours holds a significant interest, which has been paid in full. The MRI machine was installed in one of our
diagnostic imaging facilities in Florida. There are no ongoing contractual or other commitments resulting from the
transaction.

**Critical Accounting Estimates**

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Actual results could
differ from these estimates. As additional information becomes available or actual amounts are determinable, the
recorded estimates are revised and reflected in operating results in the period in which they are determined.

**Accounts Receivable**

Accounts receivable are generally non-interest bearing, unsecured obligations due from patients and third-party
payors. They are recognized initially at net realizable value and are subsequently measured at amortized cost less
loss allowances. In addition to the implicit price concessions considered and recorded when the service was
performed, at each reporting period, we estimate the expected credit losses based on a combination of probabilityweighted historic and actual bad debts experience with consideration of forward-looking information including
changes to economic conditions that would impact our customers (such as unemployment rate and general economic
environment for non-individual payors). During the period affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, management’s
consideration of those changes to economic conditions included the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Accounts receivable are considered to be in default when customers have failed to make the contractually required
payments when due. Implicit price concessions are recorded as a reduction in revenue with an offsetting amount
reducing the carrying value of the receivable. When a receivable is considered uncollectible, the receivable is
written off against the allowance for bad debts account.

**Impairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets**

Goodwill is recognized as the fair value of the consideration transferred, less the fair value of the net identifiable
assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as at the acquisition date. Subsequent to initial recognition, goodwill is
measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill acquired in business combinations is allocated to
reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The determination of reporting
units and the level at which goodwill is monitored requires judgment by management. Our reporting units generally
represent individual business units below the level of our operating segment. Goodwill is tested annually for
impairment as at October 1 or whenever indicators of impairment are present by comparing the carrying amount of
the reporting units against its fair value.

We review long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount
of an asset may not be recoverable. If any indication exists, we estimate the recoverable amount.

We assess the recoverability of the assets based on the undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use and
eventual disposition of the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable, a writedown to fair value is recorded.

Fair values are determined based on quoted market values, discounted cash flows, or external appraisals, as
applicable. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to
sell.

The amount of the impairment charge is calculated as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value,
which generally represents the discounted future cash flows from that asset or in the case of assets we expect to sell,
at fair value less costs to sell.

105


-----

**Income Taxes**

Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognized in the consolidated statements of
operations and comprehensive income (loss). Current income tax expense represents the amount of income taxes
payable based on tax law that is enacted at the reporting date and is adjusted for changes in estimates of tax expense
recognized in prior periods. A current tax liability or asset is recognized for income taxes payable, or paid but
recoverable, in respect of all periods to date.

We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities
and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to
reverse. A deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to
the extent that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be available to utilize such amounts.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are adjusted to the extent that it is no longer probable
that the related tax benefits will be realized. When it appears more likely than not that deferred taxes will not be
realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax asset to its estimated realizable value. For net
deferred tax assets, estimates of future taxable income are considered in determining whether net deferred tax assets
are more likely than not to be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes
levied by the same tax authority and we intend to settle our current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

We report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be
taken in a tax return. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax
expense.

**Business Combinations**

We account for business combinations using the acquisition accounting method. The total purchase price is allocated
to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on fair values as at the date of acquisition. Goodwill as at the
acquisition date is measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount of
any non-controlling interests in the acquired company over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the
identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Any non-controlling interests in the acquired company are
measured at their fair value. Best estimates and assumptions are used in the purchase price allocation process to
accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the business combination date. These estimates and
assumptions are inherently uncertain and are subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period,
which may be up to one year from the business combination date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired
and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. On conclusion of the measurement period or final
determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent
adjustments are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) in the period
in which the adjustments were determined.

**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION**
**AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - ALLIANCE**

_You should read the following discussion of the results of operations and financial condition of Alliance together_
_with the financial statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. The information in_
_this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” is presented on a_
_historical standalone basis without giving any pro forma effect to the Acquisition._

**_Overview_**

Alliance HealthCare is a leading national provider of outsourced advanced radiology and radiation therapy services
across 45 states in the United States. Alliance partners with more than 1,000 hospitals, health systems and physician
practices to provide a full continuum of solutions, including onsite outpatient services and comprehensive service
line management.

Alliance’s diagnostic imaging services are delivered through its Radiology Division (Alliance Radiology) and
oncology services through its Oncology Division (Alliance Oncology). Alliance is the nation’s largest provider of
advanced diagnostic mobile imaging services, an industry-leading operator of fixed-site radiology centers, and a
leading provider of radiation therapy solutions to hospitals and physician groups. As of March 31, 2021, it operated
547 diagnostic imaging and radiation therapy systems, including 68 fixed-site radiology centers across the country,
and 35 radiation therapy centers. Approximately 2,100 Alliance team members are committed to providing
exceptional patient care and exceeding customer expectations. Alliance was incorporated in the state of Delaware on
May 27, 1987. The information herein is presented as of the dates or for the periods specified herein; however,
subsequent to March 31, 2021 (the latest date as of which such financial information is presented), on May 31, 2021,
Alliance sold its 60% ownership interest in substantially all of the assets and certain specified liabilities of AHIP-FL
to Specialty Surgery Partners Center of Florida, LLC. AHIP-FL was the sole remaining business in Alliance’s
Interventional Division. As a result, as of the date hereof, Alliance no longer has an Interventional segment.

**_Service Overview_**

    - _Radiology Division: Alliance provides a full continuum of essential diagnostic imaging capabilities and_
service line management to hospitals and provider groups in both fixed-site and mobile settings. In a
mobile setting, Alliance focuses strategically on hospitals and health systems, providing essential,
mostly outpatient yet on-campus advanced imaging services aimed at providing needed advanced
capabilities, handling hospital imaging overflow/capacity issues, and capturing marketplace outpatient
imaging volumes. These contracts begin most often in 3+-year contracts; however, approximately 60%
of Alliance’s mobile radiology customers have been with them for more than five years and the
division’s revenue retention rate has hovered at 90-94% annually. In a fixed-site setting, Alliance often
operates in a single or multi-modality outpatient imaging environment which can be on or near a
hospital, or freestanding in a community. Fixed sites are typically contracted at 5-10 years for single
modalities, and 10-20 years for joint venture settings. In all cases, Alliance customers can contract for
Alliance’s core services (most often including advanced imaging equipment, repairs/maintenance and
certified clinical staffing) as well as overall operations management, scheduling/patient preparation,
insurance/pre-authorization, billing, payor relations, marketing and sales.

    - _Oncology Division: Alliance partners directly with hospitals, physicians, and other healthcare_
providers to offer a full suite of radiation therapy and related services, including access to the latest
radiation therapy technologies and full management of partners’ cancer care programs. The company
offers clinical staffing, physics and dosimetry services, operations management, sales and marketing,
quality and safety, equipment procurement and maintenance, billing and patient services and strategic
consultation (market analysis, site or market planning, partnership facilitation and business
development). Alliance specializes in two primary radiation therapy modalities: linear accelerators
most often used conventional, IMRT and SBRT therapies (“Linac”), and targeted, robotic linear
accelerators most often used for stereotactic radiosurgery (“SRS”).

    - _Interventional Division: Alliance provides comprehensive pain management services for a wide range_
of conditions and diseases through therapeutic, minimally invasive procedures to treat and ease pain,


-----

medication, laboratory testing, and other services. All of Alliance’s pain management services are
performed either at an outpatient clinic setting or at an ambulatory surgery center (“ASC”), as
determined by the treating physician. Its services also include clinical management, pharmaceutical
referrals, functional restoration and other treatments that assist with chronic and acute pain care.

Alliance operates in three reportable business segments: Radiology, Oncology and Interventional. The following
table summarizes its revenues by segment as a percentage of total revenue.

Total ...................................................................................... 100% 100% 100% 100%

Clients and partners contract with Alliance to provide radiology and oncology services to:

    - benefit from Alliance’s extensive radiology and oncology service line management experience;

    - partner with a leader whose core competency is high quality, efficient and scalable services in the areas
of advanced diagnostic imaging and radiation therapy;

    - eliminate the need to recruit, train and manage qualified, certified clinical staff members, including
technologists or radiation therapists;

    - leverage Alliance’s extensive referring provider, consumer/patient and community outreach
capabilities to grow market share;

    - access Alliance’s full suite of ancillary services, such as scheduling, pre-authorization, patient prep,
operations management, billing, payor relations, quality and safety and other programs to manage the
service line;

    - mitigate capital investment, financial risk and contracting for maintenance associated with the
purchase of their own systems;

    - leverage Alliance’s platform to gain access to radiology and oncology services for their patients when
the demand for these services may not justify the purchase of dedicated, full-time systems and
infrastructure; and

    - gain access to services under Alliance’s regulatory and licensing approvals when they do not have
these approvals.

**_Factors Affecting Alliance’s Results of Operations_**

_Pricing_

Continued expansion of health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations and other managed care
organizations have influence over the pricing of Alliance’s services because these organizations can exert control
over patients’ access to its services and reimbursement rates for accessing those services.

108


-----

_Cost of Revenues_

The principal components of Alliance’s cost of revenues include: compensation paid to technologists, therapists,
drivers and other clinical staff; equipment system maintenance costs; insurance; medical supplies; system
transportation; team members’ travel costs; and professional costs related to the delivery of radiation therapy and
professional radiology interpretation services. Because a majority of these expenses are fixed, increased revenues as
a result of higher scan and treatment volumes per system significantly improves Alliance’s margins while lower
scan and treatment volumes result in lower margins.

_Selling, General and Administrative Expenses_

The principal components of selling, general and administrative expenses are sales and marketing costs, corporate
overhead costs, information technology and professional services.

_Net income attributable to non-controlling interest and earnings from unconsolidated investee_

Alliance records net income attributable to non-controlling interest and earnings from unconsolidated investee
related to its consolidated and unconsolidated subsidiaries, respectively. These subsidiaries primarily provide
shared-service and fixed-site diagnostic imaging, radiation therapy and interventional services.

_Reimbursement_

Alliance derives most of its revenues directly from healthcare providers, primarily from hospitals, with which it
contracts to provide services to their patients (“wholesale”). Additionally, some of Alliance’s revenues come from
patients and their third-party payors, including government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid that
Alliance bills directly (“retail”). Services for which Alliance submits direct billings for Medicare and Medicaid
patients are paid on a fee schedule basis, and patients are responsible for deductibles and coinsurance. The following
table summarizes the percentage of wholesale and retail revenues as a percentage of total revenues.

Other .............................................................................................. 1% 1% 1% 2%

Total .............................................................................................. 100% 100% 100% 100%

_Seasonality_

Alliance experiences seasonality in the revenues and margins generated for its services. First and fourth quarter
revenues are typically lower than those from the second and third quarters. First quarter revenue is affected
primarily by fewer calendar days and inclement weather, typically resulting in fewer patients being scanned or
treated during the period. Fourth quarter revenues are affected by holidays and client and patient vacation schedules,
resulting in fewer scans or treatments during the period. The variability in margins is higher than the variability in
revenues due to the fixed nature of Alliance’s costs. It also experiences fluctuations in revenues and margins due to
acquisition activity and general economic conditions, including recession or economic slowdown.

_COVID-19_

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic and recommended containment
and mitigation measures worldwide. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant volatility and uncertainty,
which has resulted in a prolonged economic downturn that has disrupted and is expected to continue to disrupt
Alliance’s business. As of March 31, 2021, the virus continues to spread outside of the United States and many
countries are experiencing a resurgence in infection rates. In the United States, vaccines are available and the
majority of Americans 18+ have received their vaccinations; the country is continuing to see a downward trend of

109


-----

cases, hospitalizations and death from COVID-19, although the potential for variants to cause resurgences remains a
significant concern.

During 2020, many of Alliance’s owned and customer operating sites were impacted by temporary closures or
reduced operating hours. As a result, it experienced a reduction in procedure volumes and corresponding revenues.
Although Alliance has continued to recover, the company cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate length or severity
of this pandemic, nor the impact on its future procedure volumes and revenues. The extent to which the COVID-19
pandemic ultimately impacts the business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity may
differ from management’s current estimates due to inherent uncertainties regarding the duration and further spread
of the pandemic overall, its severity, actions taken to contain the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and to
what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume.

In response to this market condition, Alliance took a number of actions in 2020 to mitigate the impact to future
results of operations and cash flows, as well as to protect its financial position. These actions included, but were not
limited to, the following:

    - Furloughed, reduced the hours for or eliminated the positions of a substantial number of employees;

    - Reduced compensation for executive and management employees;

    - Implemented certain other cost reductions;

    - Deferred spending on capital expenditures; and

    - Borrowed on its revolving loan facility as a precautionary measure to increase its cash position and
help maintain financial flexibility.

In addition, Alliance entered into amendments to its Credit Agreements (as defined below) during 2020. The
amendments provided for, among other things, the amendment to certain financial covenants.

On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law. The CARES Act includes, among other things, a number
of benefits that are applicable to Alliance and other healthcare providers, provisions relating to the deferment of the
employer portion of social security tax payments, as well as changes to federal income tax law including increases to
the limit on the deduction for net interest expense and acceleration of the timing for refunds of alternative minimum
tax credits. In addition, Alliance received payments in connection with certain provisions of the CARES Act
including: (i) advanced Medicare payments and (ii) government grants to compensate for healthcare related
[expenses or lost revenues attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. On December 27, 2020, the Consolidated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_Appropriations_Act%2C_2021)
[Appropriations Act, 2021 was signed into law, which provided additional stimulus relief and renewed some CARES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_Appropriations_Act%2C_2021)
Act programs that had expired.

Total ................................................................................................................................... $ 496,208 $ 569,388

Revenue decreased by $73.2 million, or 12.9%, to $496.2 million in 2020 compared to $569.4 million in 2019
primarily due to decreases in Radiology, Oncology and Interventional revenues of $56.5 million, $1.4 million and
$14.4 million, respectively.

Total Radiology revenue decreased by $56.5 million, or 15.5%, to $308.8 million in 2020, compared to $365.3
million in 2019, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 and the resulting decrease in scans during the period.

MRI revenue decreased by $31.8 million, or 16.1%, to $165.8 million in 2020. The decrease is attributable to the
following factors:

    - Same-store-growth (“SSG”) for MRI, which is calculated by comparing the cumulative scan, treatment
or case volume at all locations in the current year’s period to the same period in the prior year,
decreased by 12.9%.

    - Scan-based MRI revenue decreased by $27.4 million, or 16.5%, to $138.1 million in 2020 from $165.5
million in 2019. The decrease in scan-based MRI revenue was primarily due to year-over-year
decreases in the total number of scan-based MRI scans, scans per system per day, and the average
number of scan-based systems in service, partially offset by an increase in average revenue per scan.
Total scan-based MRI scan volume decreased by 20.7% to 451,790 scans in 2020 from 569,385 scans
in 2019. Scans per scan-based system per day decreased to 9.4 in 2020 from 10.3 in 2019. Revenue per
scan increased by 5.2% from $290.61 in 2019 to $305.68 in 2020. The average number of scan-based
systems in service decreased to 193.8 systems in 2020 from 202.9 systems for the same period in 2019.

    - Non-scan-based MRI revenue decreased by $4.4 million to $27.7 million in 2020 compared to the
same period in 2019.

PET/CT revenue decreased by $15.2 million, or 11.2%, to $120.4 million in 2020 compared to $135.5 million in
2019. The decrease is attributable to the following factors:

    - SSG for PET/CT revenue decreased by 2.0% for the year ended December 31, 2020.

    - Scan-based PET/CT revenue decreased by $15.0 million, or 11.7%, to $113.7 million in 2020 from
$128.7 million during in 2019. The decrease in scan-based PET/CT revenue was primarily due to yearover-year decreases in the total number of scan-based PET/CT scans, scans per system per day, and the
average number of scan-based systems in service, partially offset by an increase in average revenue per
scan. Total volume of PET/CT scans decreased 17.3% to 117,056 scans in 2020 compared to 141,580
scans in 2019. Scans per system per day decreased to 5.5 in 2020 compared to 6.0 in 2019. The
average revenue per PET/CT scan increased from $909.15 per scan in 2019 to $971.44 per scan in
2020. The average number of scan-based PET/CT systems in service decreased to 93.5 systems in
2020 compared to 102.9 systems in 2019.

    - Non-scan based PET/CT revenue decreased by $0.2 million in 2020 compared to the same period in
2019.

Included in the Radiology revenue totals above are fixed-site imaging center revenues, which decreased by $14.8
million, or 15.4%, to $81.0 million in 2020 over the same period in 2019.

Oncology revenue decreased by $1.4 million, or 1.0%, to $141.8 million in 2020 compared to $143.1 million in
2019, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 and the resulting decrease in treatment volumes, as well as the
closure of certain underperforming sites during 2019. The number of Linac treatments performed decreased by
5.2%, and SSG for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by 4.4%. SSG for SRS decreased by 4.5% for the
year ended December 31, 2020. The number of SRS patients treated in 2020 decreased by 4.1% when compared to
the same period in 2019.

Interventional revenue decreased by $14.4 million, or 24.2%, to $45.1 million in 2020 compared to $59.5 million in
2019, primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19 and temporary state-mandated closures of ASCs in both Arizona
and Florida in March 2020. Alliance’s ASCs in both Arizona and Florida started to reopen in April 2020.

At December 31, 2020, Alliance had 279 MRI systems and 112 PET/CT systems compared to 299 MRI systems and
118 PET/CT systems at December 31, 2019. Alliance operated 68 fixed-site radiology centers at December 31,
2020, compared to 70 fixed-site radiology centers at December 31, 2019. It operated 35 radiation therapy centers
and SRS facilities (including one unconsolidated investee) at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.

Cost of revenues, excluding depreciation and amortization, decreased by $48.7 million, or 13.7%, to $307.0 million
in 2020 compared to $355.7 million in 2019. The decrease in cost of revenues consisted primarily of a $24.7 million
decrease in compensation and related employee expenses, a $7.5 million decrease in maintenance and related costs,
a $7.5 million decrease in medical supplies expense, a $2.7 million decrease in transportation and fuel expenses, a
$1.9 million decrease in rent expenses, a $1.6 million decrease in marketing and business development expenses, a
$1.5 million decrease in travel and entertainment expenses, and a $1.4 million decrease in outsourced services, as a
result of lower treatment volumes due to COVID-19 and restructuring initiatives and other cost reductions
implemented in 2020. Cost of revenues, excluding depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of revenue,
decreased to 61.9% in 2020 compared to 62.5% in 2019.

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $12.8 million, or 13.8%, to $80.5 million in 2020
compared to $93.3 million in 2019. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses consisted primarily
of a decrease in compensation and related employee expenses of $12.3 million, a decrease of $1.9 million in travel
and entertainment expenses, and a decrease of $1.7 million in professional and legal expenses, partially offset by a
$3.1 million increase in bad debt expense. The overall decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was
primarily due to restructuring initiatives and other cost reductions implemented in 2020. Selling, general and
administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue was 16.2% in 2020 compared to 16.4% in 2019.

Transaction costs decreased by $11.6 million to $1.4 million in 2020 compared to $12.9 million in 2019.
Transaction costs represent due diligence and other expenses incurred in connection with business acquisitions and
partnership investments pursuant to strategic planning by management. The decrease in transaction costs was related
to an $11.0 million termination fee paid in connection with terminating a proposed transaction to acquire e+ Cancer
Care in February 2019.

Restructuring charges decreased by $5.1 million to $1.1 million in 2020 compared to $6.2 million in 2019.
Restructuring charges relate primarily to certain leased facilities in the Oncology Division.

Impairment charges increased by $24.2 million to $29.6 million in 2020 compared to $5.4 million in 2019.
Impairment charges during 2020 are composed of a $19.0 million goodwill impairment charge and a $10.0 million
intangible asset impairment charge related to the Interventional reporting unit, and a $0.6 million charge related to
certain long-term assets that were deemed unrecoverable. Impairment charges in 2019 are composed of a $3.9
million goodwill impairment charge related to the Interventional reporting unit and $1.5 million of charges related to
certain long-term assets that were deemed unrecoverable.

Severance and related costs were $1.9 million in 2020 compared to $2.9 million in 2019.

-----

Loss on extinguishment or modification of debt was $14.6 million in 2020 and relates to lender fees and legal,
professional and other expenses incurred in connection with the amendments to Alliance’s Credit Agreements
during 2020. There was no loss on extinguishment or modification of debt in 2019.

Depreciation expense decreased by $4.2 million, or 7.2%, to $54.9 million in 2020 compared to $59.1 million in
2019. The decrease in depreciation expense is due to the year-over-year decrease in the number of units in the fleet
along with reduced capital investments made during the last twelve months.

Amortization expense was $12.2 million in 2020 compared to $12.7 million in 2019.

Interest expense, net increased by $0.3 million, or 0.5%, to $56.5 million in 2020 compared to $56.2 million in
2019. The increase is primarily due to the increase in interest rates and deferred financing costs in connection with
the amendments to Alliance’s Credit Agreements during 2020, partially offset by a decline in LIBOR interest rates
in 2020 compared to 2019.

Other income, net increased by $8.0 million to $11.2 million in 2020 compared to $3.2 million in 2019. The increase
is primarily due to $6.2 million of stimulus payments received from the Department of Health and Human Services
(“HHS”) in connection with the CARES Act and $2.4 million of gain on sale of certain joint venture membership
interests in the Radiology and Interventional Divisions.

Income tax expense was $0.3 million in 2020 compared to income tax benefit of $6.1 million in 2019. The increase
of the income tax expense in 2020 compared to 2019 was driven primarily by a valuation allowance recorded
against certain deferred tax assets, partially offset by an increase in the income tax benefit associated with an
increase in pre-tax loss in 2020 compared to 2019. Based on its earnings history and available objectively verifiable
positive and negative evidence, Alliance determined that it was more likely than not that a portion of its deferred tax
assets would not be realized in the future.

Earnings from unconsolidated investee were $1.3 million in both 2020 and 2019.

Net income attributable to non-controlling interest decreased by $6.5 million, or 35.0%, to $12.1 million in 2020
compared to $18.7 million in 2019. The decrease was mostly attributable to decreases in year-over-year net income
derived from Alliance’s joint venture partners.

Net loss attributable to Alliance HealthCare Services, Inc. was $63.4 million in 2020 compared to $43.1 million in
2019.

Adjusted EBITDA in 2020 decreased by $3.3 million or 2.6%, to $125.8 million from $129.1 million in 2019
primarily due to a decrease in volumes in each of our businesses due to the impact of COVID-19 on treatment
volumes, partially offset by HHS stimulus funding, restructuring initiatives and other cost reductions implemented
in the first half of 2020, and performance improvement in Oncology as a result of the closure of underperforming
sites.

Revenue decreased by $12.9 million, or 9.7%, to $119.5 million during the three months ended March 31, 2021
compared to $132.4 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020 primarily due to decreases in Radiology,
Oncology and Interventional revenues of $1.1 million, $1.7 million and $9.8 million, respectively.

Total Radiology revenue decreased by $1.1 million, or 1.3%, to $81.4 million during the three months ended March
31, 2021 compared to $82.5 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily due to the impact of
COVID-19 and the resulting decrease in scans during the period and inclement weather in February 2021.

MRI revenue decreased by $1.7 million, or 3.7%, to $42.8 million during the three months ended March 31, 2021
compared to $44.4 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020.

    - Same-store-growth (“SSG”) for MRI, which we calculate by comparing the cumulative scan, treatment
or case volume at all locations in the current year’s period to the same period in the prior year,
increased by 5.2%.

    - Scan-based MRI revenue decreased by $0.3 million, or 0.8%, to $36.7 million during the three months
ended March 31, 2021 from $37.0 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020. The
decrease in scan-based MRI revenue was primarily due to year-over-year decreases in the total number
of scan-based MRI scans and the average number of scan-based systems in service, partially offset by
increases in scans per system per day and average revenue per scan. Total scan-based MRI scan
volume decreased by 3.4% to 119,900 scans during the three months ended March 31, 2021 from
124,075 scans during the three months ended March 31, 2020. The average number of scan-based
systems in service decreased to 184.5 systems during the three months ended March 31, 2021 from

-----

203.3 systems for the same period in 2020. Scans per scan-based system per day increased to 10.0
million during the three months ended March 31, 2021 from 9.4 during the three months ended March
31, 2020. Revenue per scan increased by 2.7% from $298.42 during the three months ended March 31,
2020 to $306.35 during the three months ended March 31, 2021.

    - Non-scan-based MRI revenue decreased by $1.4 million to $6.1 million during the three months ended
March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020.

PET/CT revenue increased by $0.8 million, or 2.5%, to $32.0 million during the three months ended March 31, 2021
compared to $31.2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020.

    - SSG for PET/CT revenue decreased by 1.5% for the three months ended March 31, 2021.

    - Scan-based PET/CT revenue increased by $0.7 million, or 2.4%, to $30.1 million during the three
months ended March 31, 2021 from $29.4 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020
primarily due to the increase in revenue attributable to Specialty Tracers. The scan-based PET/CT
revenue reflects an increase in the average revenue per scan, partially offset by a year-over-year
decrease in the total number of scan-based PET/CT scans. The average revenue per PET/CT scan
increased from $956.45 per scan during the three months ended March 31, 2020 to $1,022.65 per scan
during the three months ended March 31, 2021. Total volume of PET/CT scans decreased 4.2% to
29,477 scans during the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to 30,781 scans during the
three months ended March 31, 2020.

Included in the Radiology revenue totals above are fixed-site imaging center revenues, which increased by $0.6
million, or 2.8%, to $22.2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2021 over the same period in 2020.

Oncology revenue decreased by $1.7 million, or 4.7%, to $34.4 million during the three months ended March 31,
2021 compared to $36.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily due to the impact of
COVID-19 and the resulting decrease in treatment volumes, inclement weather in February 2021 and the temporary
closure of one Cyberknife site for equipment refresh. The number of Linac treatments performed decreased by
10.0% and SSG for the three months ended March 31, 2021 decreased by 10.7%. SSG for SRS decreased by 8.7%
for the three months ended March 31, 2021. The number of SRS cases completed during the three months ended
March 31, 2021 decreased by 8.7% from the same period in 2020.

Interventional revenue decreased by $9.8 million, or 72.4%, to $3.7 million during the three months ended March
31, 2021 compared to $13.5 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily due to the sale of its
joint venture membership interest in Alliance Interventional (“AI Sale”) in December 2020. Alliance Interventional
was the sole owner of The Pain Center of Arizona (“TPC”). TPC revenue was $8.8 million during the three months
ended March 31, 2020.

At March 31, 2021, Alliance had 275 MRI systems and 106 PET/CT systems. Alliance had 293 MRI systems and
115 PET/CT systems at March 31, 2020. Alliance operated 68 fixed-site radiology centers at March 31, 2021,
compared to 71 fixed-site radiology centers at March 31, 2020. Alliance operated 35 radiation therapy centers and
SRS facilities (including one unconsolidated investee) at March 31, 2021 and 2020.

during the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to $85.5 million during the same period in 2020.
Excluding the cost of revenues of TPC, which was $6.4 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020, cost
of revenues decreased by $6.1 million. This decrease in cost of revenues consisted primarily of a $3.7 million
decrease in compensation and related employee expenses, a $1.3 million decrease in maintenance and related costs,
a $0.5 million decrease in travel and entertainment expenses, a $0.4 million decrease in outsourced service contracts
and a $0.3 million decrease in marketing expenses. Cost of revenues, excluding depreciation and amortization, as a
percentage of revenue, decreased to 61.1% during the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to 64.6%
during the three months ended March 31, 2020.

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $2.0 million, or 8.9%, to $21.0 million during the three
months ended March 31, 2021 compared to $23.0 million during the same period in 2020. Excluding the selling,

-----

general and administrative expenses of TPC, which was $1.9 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020,
selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $0.1 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses
as a percentage of revenue was 17.5% during the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to 17.4% during the
three months ended March 31, 2020.

Transaction costs increased by $0.2 million to $0.7 million during the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared
to $0.5 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020. Transaction costs represent due diligence and other
expenses incurred in connection with business acquisitions and partnership investments pursuant to strategic
planning by management.

Restructuring charges increased by $0.5 million to $0.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2021
compared to $0.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020. Restructuring charges relate primarily to
certain leased facilities in our Oncology Division.

Severance and related costs were $0.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to $0.5
million during the three months ended March 31, 2020.

Depreciation expense decreased by $1.1 million, or 8.2%, to $12.7 million during the three months ended March 31,
2021 compared to $13.9 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease in depreciation
expense is primarily due to the year-over-year decrease in the number of our diagnostic imaging systems.

Amortization expense was $2.5 million during the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to $3.1 million
during the three months ended March 31, 2020.

Interest expense, net increased by $2.8 million, or 20.9%, to $16.0 million during the three months ended March 31,
2021 compared to $13.2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020. The increase is primarily due to the
increase in Alliance’s interest rates and amortization of deferred financing costs in connection with the amendments
to its Credit Agreements in October 2020.

Other income, net increased by $0.4 million to $0.8 million during the three months ended March 31, 2021
compared to $0.4 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020. The increase is primarily due to $0.2
million of management fees earned for transition services during the three months ended March 31, 2021 related to
the AI Sale and an increase of $0.2 million in gain on the sale of assets.

Earnings from unconsolidated investee were $0.3 million during both the three months ended March 31, 2021 and
2020.

Net income attributable to non-controlling interest decreased by $0.8 million, or 17.6%, to $3.9 million during the
three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to $4.7 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020. The
decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in year-over-year earnings from our joint ventures.

Net loss attributable to Alliance HealthCare Services, Inc. was $9.9 million during the three months ended March
31, 2021 compared to $11.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020.

Adjusted EBITDA during the three months ended March 31, 2021 increased by $2.8 million or 10.9%, to $29.0
million from $26.2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020 primarily due to restructuring initiatives
and other cost reductions implemented in the year ended December 31, 2020.

**_Adjusted EBITDA_**

Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the
U.S. (“GAAP”). Alliance believes, in addition to GAAP metrics, this non-GAAP metric is a useful measure for
investors for a variety of reasons. Alliance’s management regularly communicates Adjusted EBITDA and their
interpretation of such results to its board of directors. Alliance also compares actual periodic Adjusted EBITDA
against internal targets as a key factor in determining cash incentive compensation for executives and other
employees, largely because Alliance views Adjusted EBITDA results as indicative of how our Radiology, Oncology
and Interventional businesses are performing and being managed.

117


-----

Alliance defines Adjusted EBITDA as net loss attributable to Alliance HealthCare Services before: income taxes;
non-controlling interest in subsidiaries; interest expense, net; depreciation expense; amortization expense;
transaction costs; restructuring charges; impairment charges; severance and related costs; loss on extinguishment or
modification of debt; legal matters and other expenses; share-based compensation; and other charges (benefits), net.
For a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA, see “Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information
_and Other Data – Alliance.”_

The presentation of a non-GAAP metric does not imply that the reconciling items presented are non-recurring,
infrequent or unusual. In general, non-GAAP metrics have certain limitations as analytical financial measures and
are used in conjunction with GAAP results to evaluate our operating performance and by considering independently
the economic effects of the items that are or are not reflected in non-GAAP metrics. Alliance compensates for such
limitations by providing GAAP-based disclosures concerning the excluded items in its financial disclosures. As a
result of these limitations, and because non-GAAP metrics may not be directly comparable to similarly titled
measures reported by other companies, the non-GAAP metrics are not an alternative to the most directly comparable
GAAP measure or any other GAAP measure of operating performance.

**_Liquidity and Capital Resources_**

Alliance’s primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under its revolving
loan facility. It generated $11.7 million and $26.8 million of cash flow from operating activities during the three
months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $80.5 million and $63.2 million of cash flow from
operating activities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The year-over-year
decrease in the first quarter was primarily related to changes in its operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by
a decrease of $2.7 million of interest paid primarily resulting from the amendments to its Credit Agreements in
October 2020. Alliance’s ability to generate cash flow is affected by numerous factors, including demand for MRI,
PET/CT, other diagnostic imaging, radiation oncology, interventional services and other revenues. The
year-over-year decrease during the fiscal year was primarily related to $6.6 million of stimulus payments received
from HHS and $6.1 million of advanced payments for future Medicare services received from CMS in connection
with the CARES ACT, decreased transaction costs in connection with the termination of a proposed transaction in
2019, change in deferred income taxes, and decreased restructuring charges related primarily to certain leased
facilities in Alliance’s Oncology Division, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of COVID-19 on Alliance’s
business operations. Its ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is also dependent upon the collections
of its accounts receivable. Alliance’s number of days of revenue outstanding for its accounts receivable was 53 days
at March 31, 2021 and 49 days as of December 31, 2020. As of March 31, 2021, it had $39.5 million of available
borrowings under its revolving loan facility, net of $80.0 million outstanding on the revolving loan facility and $5.5
million outstanding in letters of credit. Management of alliance expects that it will be in compliance with the debt
covenants under its credit agreements for at least the next twelve months.

Alliance used cash of $8.1 million and $7.8 million for investing activities during the three months ended March 31,
2021 and 2020, respectively. Investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2021 included $6.2
million in cash used for purchases of property and equipment and $3.8 million in cash used for deposits on
equipment, partially offset by $1.3 million in collections of notes receivable and $0.6 million of proceeds from sale
of assets.

Investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2020 included $3.8 million in cash used for purchases
of property and equipment and $4.4 million in cash used for deposits on equipment, partially offset by $0.4 million
of proceeds from sale of assets. Investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2020 included $27.2 million in
cash used for purchases of property and equipment, an increase in deposits on equipment of $4.9 million and $7.4
million that was used for an acquisition, partially offset by $3.6 million of net proceeds from the sale of assets.
Investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2019 included $26.8 million in cash used for purchases of
property and equipment and $7.7 million in cash used for deposits on equipment, partially offset by $2.5 million of
proceeds from the sale of assets and $0.4 million from other investing activities.

Alliance may continue to use cash for acquisitions in the future. Other than acquisitions, its primary use of capital
resources is to fund capital expenditures. Alliance spends capital to:

    - purchase new systems;

118


-----

    - replace less advanced systems with new systems;

    - upgrade MRI, PET/CT and radiation oncology systems; and

    - upgrade its corporate infrastructure, primarily in information technology.

Capital expenditures totaled $6.2 million and $3.8 million during the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020,
respectively. Alliance purchased 1 radiation therapy system during the three months ended March 31, 2021. Capital
expenditures totaled $27.2 million and $26.8 million in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Alliance purchased three MRI, four PETCT, one CT and five radiation therapy systems in 2020. Alliance expects to
purchase additional systems in 2021 and finance substantially all of these purchases with its available cash, cash
from operating activities and equipment debt.

Net cash used in financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2021 was $5.5 million. Net cash
provided by financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2020 was $19.4 million. Financing
activities during the three months ended March 31, 2021 included principal payments on its term loan facility of
$7.7 million, principal payments on equipment debt and capital lease obligations of $6.6 million, and distributions to
non-controlling interest in subsidiaries of $7.0 million, partially offset by proceeds from equipment debt of $15.8
million. Net cash used in financing activities were $34.2 million and $37.6 million in the years ended December 31,
2020 and 2019 respectively.

In the year ended December 31, 2020, financing activities included net proceeds of $43.0 million from Alliance’s
revolving loan facility and proceeds from equipment debt of $16.4 million, partially offset by principal payments on
Alliance’s term loan facility of $22.2 million, principal payments on equipment debt and capital lease obligations of
$24.8 million, distributions to noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries of $26.4 million, and payments of deferred
financing costs of $20.0 million. In the year ended December 31, 2019, financing activities included $22.0 million
proceeds from equipment debt, $8.5 million capital contribution and $0.5 million of contributions from
noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries, partially offset by principal payments on Alliance’s term loan facility of
$10.1 million, net payments of $10.0 million on Alliance’s revolving loan facility, principal payments on equipment
debt and capital lease obligations of $21.7 million, and distributions to noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries of
$26.8 million.

Financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2020 included net proceeds of $28.0 million from its
revolving loan facility and proceeds of $7.9 million from equipment debt, partially offset by principal payments on
equipment debt and capital lease obligations of $6.2 million, principal payments on its term loan facility of $5.1
million, and distributions to non-controlling interest in subsidiaries of $5.3 million.

Alliance had cash and cash equivalents of $23.9 million, $25.8 million and $15.1 million at March 31, 2021,
December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.

Available cash and cash equivalents are maintained in high-credit-quality third-party financial institutions. To date,
Alliance has experienced no loss or lack of access to its invested cash or cash equivalents; however, it cannot assure
that access to its invested cash and cash equivalents will not be affected by adverse conditions in the financial
markets.

At March 31, 2021, December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, Alliance had $17.5 million, $20.0 million and
$15.7 million, respectively, in its accounts with third-party financial institutions that exceed the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance limits. While it monitors the cash balances in its operating accounts daily
and adjust the cash balances as appropriate, these cash balances could be adversely affected if the underlying
financial institutions fail or could be subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets.

**_Acquisitions_**

On September 15, 2020, through its Radiology Division, Alliance completed the purchase of a 100% membership
interest in three radiology centers and a 51% membership interest in a fourth radiology center from Molecular
Imaging Technologies, LLC (“MIT”). The purchase price for this acquisition was $7.4 million in the aggregate and
was funded with proceeds from Alliance’s existing cash balance. The estimated fair value of the identifiable assets

119


-----

acquired at the acquisition date was $6.5 million, including identifiable intangible assets of $5.4 million. The excess
purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired was $1.4 million and was recorded in goodwill. The amounts
recorded for goodwill and intangible assets are being amortized over 15 years for tax purposes. Acquired intangible
assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The fair values of the identifiable
intangible assets were estimated using a valuation methodology representing Level 3 fair value measurements.

The values assigned to the identifiable intangible assets acquired are preliminary and may be subject to adjustment
upon the final determination of their respective fair values.

**_Disposition of Alliance Interventional, LLC_**

On December 31, 2020, Alliance sold its 77.28% membership interest in Alliance Interventional (“AI”) to
Alliance’s joint venture partners (the “AI Sale”) who owned the remaining 22.72% membership interest. AI is the
sole owner of The Pain Center of Arizona (“TPC”).

Prior to the AI Sale, AI owned 60% of the membership interests in Alliance Interventional-Florida, LLC (“AHIPFL”) and the joint venture partners of AI assigned their indirect membership interest in AHIP-FL to Alliance.
Following that transaction, AI no longer had a membership interest in AHIP-FL. In connection with the joint venture
partners’ assignment of their indirect ownership in AHIP-FL to Alliance, Alliance reclassified $2.2 million from
non-controlling interest to additional paid-in capital, which primarily represents the accumulated deficit allocated to
the assigned non-controlling interest.

The total consideration received for the AI Sale was $15.0 million, consisting of $1.25 million in cash paid at
closing and a $13.75 million promissory note due from the joint venture partners. The promissory note requires
various principal payments during its term and is due on December 31, 2023. The promissory note bears interest at
an annual interest rate of 9% through December 31, 2022 and 10% from January 1, 2023 through December 31,
2023. The promissory note is collateralized by a first priority security interest in all assets of AI and subsidiaries and
secured by a pledge from the joint venture partners of a first priority security interest in their equity interests in AI.

As a result of the sale, Alliance wrote-off $15.2 million related to the carrying value of the non-controlling interest,
$17.3 million of intangible assets, and $8.4 million related to goodwill allocated to the disposed business. Alliance
recognized a gain on sale of $0.3 million, which was recorded in other income, net in the consolidated statement of
operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2020.

**_Other_**

In July 2019, Alliance sold its interest in a consolidated joint venture for $1.2 million. As a result of the disposition,
Alliance wrote-off $1.8 million related to the carrying value of the non-controlling interest. The net impact to
earnings in connection with the sale was immaterial.

In August 2020, Alliance sold substantially all of the assets of a radiology center for $0.5 million. As a result of the
disposition, Alliance recognized a gain on sale of $0.4 million, which was recorded in other income, net in the
consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2020.

In November 2020, Alliance sold its 50% membership interest in a consolidated joint venture for $2.2 million. As a
result of the disposition, Alliance wrote-off $0.2 million related to the carrying value of the non-controlling interest
and $0.2 million related to goodwill allocated to the disposed business. In addition, Alliance recognized a gain on
sale of $1.8 million, which was recorded in other income, net in the consolidated statement of operations and
comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2020.

**_Equipment Debt_**

Alliance’s equipment debt is composed of financing arrangements with various lenders. The Company was in
compliance with all such covenants as of March 31, 2021, except for one covenant in an agreement between an
equipment lender and one of the Company’s controlled joint ventures. The equipment debt outstanding under this
arrangement as of March 31, 2021 was $7.1 million. A waiver was obtained from the equipment lender for the
violation of the minimum debt service coverage ratio for the trailing 12-month period as of March 31, 2021.

120


-----

**_Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements_**

In the normal course of business, Alliance has made certain guarantees and indemnities, under which it may be
required to make payments to a guaranteed or indemnified party, in relation to certain transactions. Alliance
indemnifies other parties, including customers, lessors, and parties to other transactions with Alliance, with respect
to certain matters. Alliance has agreed to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from certain events as
defined within the particular contract, which may include, for example, litigation or claims arising from a breach of
representations or covenants. In addition, Alliance has entered into indemnification agreements with its executive
officers and directors and its bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations. Under these arrangements, Alliance
is obligated to indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, its current or former officers and
directors for various amounts incurred with respect to actions, suits or proceedings in which they were made, or
threatened to be made, a party as a result of acting as an officer or director.

It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the
limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular
agreement. Historically, payments made related to these indemnifications have been immaterial. As of March 31,
2021, Alliance has determined that no liability is necessary related to these guarantees and indemnities.

**_Critical Accounting Policies_**

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. The significant accounting policies that Alliance believes are the most critical to aid in fully
understanding and evaluating its reported financial results include the following:

**_Revenue Recognition_**

Alliance derives the majority of its revenue directly from healthcare providers, primarily for imaging and radiation
oncology services. To a lesser extent, Alliance generates revenues from direct billings to patients or their medical
payors, and it records these revenues net of contractual discounts, estimated uncollectible amounts associated with
patients, and other arrangements for providing services at less than established patient billing rates.

Alliance recognizes revenue in the period in which it satisfies its performance obligations by transferring goods or
services to its customers. Alliance records the amount of revenue that reflects the consideration that it expects to
receive in exchange for those goods or services. Alliance applies the following five-step model in order to determine
this amount: (i) identification of the contract with a customer; (ii) identification of the promised goods or services in
the contract and determination of whether they represent obligations, including whether they are distinct in the
context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration;
(iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as)
Alliance satisfies each performance obligation.

Alliance continuously monitors collections from direct patient billings and compares these collections to revenue,
net of contractual adjustments and estimated implicit price concessions related to uninsured amounts, recorded at the
time of service. While these contractual adjustments and implicit price concessions have historically been within
Alliance’s expectations and the provisions established, an inability to accurately estimate contractual adjustments
and implicit price concessions in the future could have a material adverse effect on Alliance’s operating results. For
certain contracts, Alliance generates revenue from the rental of equipment and it accounts for such contracts as
operating leases. The revenue for these arrangements is recognized over the term of the related contract.

**_Valuation of Accounts Receivable_**

Alliance provides shared and single-user diagnostic imaging and oncology equipment and technical support services
to the healthcare industry and directly to patients on an outpatient basis. Substantially all of Alliance’s accounts
receivable are due from hospitals, other healthcare providers and health insurance providers, including Medicare,
located throughout the U.S. Services are generally provided under long-term contracts with hospitals and other
healthcare providers or directly to patients, and generally collateral is not required. Alliance generally collects
receivables within industry norms for third-party payors. Alliance continuously monitors collections from its clients

121


-----

and maintains an allowance for estimated credit losses based upon any specific client collection issues that it has
identified and its historical experience. Although credit losses have historically been within Alliance’s expectations
and the provisions established, an inability to accurately estimate credit losses in the future could have a material
adverse effect on its operating results.

**_Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets_**

ASC 350 requires that goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but instead tested for
impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level. In addition, ASC 350 defines a reporting unit as an operating
segment or one level below an operating segment (also known as a component). A component of an operating
segment is a reporting unit under ASC 350 if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial
information is available and used by management. Alliance has evaluated ASC 350 and concluded there are three
operating segments: Radiology, Oncology and Interventional. Alliance has assessed that each component listed
above meets the definition of a reporting unit based on the conclusions that each component constitutes a business,
discrete financial information is available for each component, and management regularly reviews the results of
such financial information.

In accordance with ASC 350, Alliance performs an annual impairment test in the fourth quarter for goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would morelikely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Such indicators include a
sustained significant decline in expected future cash flows due to changes in company-specific factors or the broader
business climate.

In evaluating goodwill for impairment, Alliance first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is morelikely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If Alliance concludes that it is
more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, Alliance conducts a
quantitative goodwill impairment test. First, for each reporting unit, Alliance compares its estimated fair value with
its net book value. If the estimated fair value exceeds its net book value, goodwill is deemed not to be impaired, and
no further testing is necessary. If the estimated fair value does not exceed its net book value, goodwill is deemed to
be impaired. Alliance records an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of the reporting
unit exceeds its fair value.

The quantitative impairment analysis utilizes two primary approaches to calculate the fair value of the reporting
unit: the discounted cash flow method (“DCF”) and the Guideline Public Company (“GPC”) method.

Under the DCF method, value is measured as the present worth of anticipated future net cash flows generated by a
business. In a multi-period model, net cash flows attributable to a business are forecasted for an appropriate period
and then discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. In a single-period model, net cash flow or
earnings for a normalized period are capitalized to reach a determination of present value. The methods, key
assumptions, degree of uncertainty associated with the key assumptions and the potential events or changes in
circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the key assumptions with respect to the
reporting unit are the estimated future net cash flows generated and the discount rate applied to capture the
associated risks. The ability to achieve anticipated future net cash flows is subject to numerous assumptions and
risks, including company-specific risks such as the ability to maintain and grow revenues, maintain or improve
operating margins, control costs and anticipate working capital requirements. The anticipated future net cash flows
are also dependent on industry-level factors, such as the impact of legislation, patient volumes and cost
reimbursement levels, and the continued availability of qualified doctors and other medical professionals who are
necessary to staff Alliance’s operations, among other potential impacts.

Under the GPC method, value is estimated by comparing the subject company to similar companies with publiclytraded ownership interests. Guideline companies are selected based on comparability to the subject company, and
valuation multiples are calculated and applied to subject company operating data. The key assumption used in
connection with the GPC method focuses on identifying guideline companies that operate in the same (or similar)
line of business as the reporting units with the same (or similar) operating characteristics. Eligible companies were
selected based on Global Industry Classification Standard codes, Standard Industrial Classification codes, company
descriptions, and industry affiliations. Considered factors include relative risk, profitability, and growth
considerations of the reporting unit relative to the guideline companies. Value estimates for the reporting unit

122


-----

involve using multiples of market value of invested capital excluding cash to revenue and EBITDA. Valuations
derived using the GPC method rely on information primarily obtained from available industry market data and
publicly available filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

In testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, Alliance first assesses qualitative factors to determine
whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying
amount. If Alliance concludes that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset
is less than its carrying amount, Alliance conducts a quantitative impairment test, which consists of a comparison of
the fair value to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized
in an amount equal to that excess.

Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis and
are reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC 360, “Property, Plant, and Equipment.”

Goodwill was tested for impairment at the reporting unit level as of October 1, 2020 and October 1, 2019, the dates
of Alliance’s annual impairment review for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Alliance
performed a quantitative test as part of its annual impairment review. In estimating fair values, Alliance used a
combination of the income approach (the DCF method) and the market approach (the GPC method).

In both 2020 and 2019, Alliance’s respective annual impairment tests yielded individual fair values for its Radiology
and Oncology reporting units that exceeded their respective carrying values; therefore, these reporting units were not
considered at risk of impairment. The estimated fair values at October 1, 2020 exceeded their carrying values by
99% and 87% for the Radiology and Oncology reporting units, respectively. In connection with 2020 and 2019
annual impairment tests, Alliance concluded that the carrying value of the Interventional reporting unit exceeded its
estimated fair value based on management’s assessment of the outlook and long-term business plans for this
division. Consequently, Alliance recorded an impairment charge of $19.0 million and $3.9 million related to
goodwill in the Interventional reporting unit in 2020 and 2019, respectively. In connection with the AI Sale, the
remaining Interventional goodwill balance of $8.4 million was written off as of December 31, 2020.

During December 2020, Alliance re-evaluated its finite-lived intangible assets associated with its Interventional
Division due to the projected outlook and long-term business plans for the division, as well as in connection with the
divestiture of a portion of this division through the AI Sale. Consequently, Alliance recorded an impairment charge
of $10.0 million for the remaining carrying value of the intangible assets associated with its Interventional Division
during the year ended December 31, 2020.

Changes in estimates or assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and the conclusions of
Alliance’s impairment tests. In addition to its annual review, Alliance performs a test of impairment when indicators
of impairment are present. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no indications of impairment of
Alliance’s goodwill balances.

The determination of fair value of Alliance’s reporting units requires significant estimates and assumptions. These
estimates and assumptions primarily include earnings and required capital projections, discount rates, terminal
growth rates, and operating income for each reporting unit and the weighting assigned to the results of each of the
valuation methods described above. Changes in certain assumptions could have a significant impact on the goodwill
impairment assessment. Alliance evaluated the significant assumptions used to determine the estimated fair values
of each reporting unit, both individually and in the aggregate, and concluded they are reasonable. However, if weak
market conditions continue for an extended period or the operating results of any of Alliance’s reporting units
decline substantially compared to projected results, Alliance could determine that it needs to record additional
impairment charges.

**_Purchase Accounting_**

In accordance with GAAP, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquired business are recorded at their
estimated fair values on the date of acquisition. The difference between the purchase price amount and the net fair
value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill on the balance sheet if it exceeds the
estimated fair value and as a bargain purchase gain on the income statement if it is below the estimated fair value.
Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment, often utilizes

123


-----

independent valuation experts and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the
timing and amounts of future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, market prices and asset lives, among other
items. The judgments made in the determination of the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed, as well as the estimated useful life of each asset and the duration of each liability, can materially
impact the financial statements in periods after acquisition, such as through depreciation and amortization expense.

**Overview**

**Akumin Business Overview**

Akumin is a leading provider of outpatient diagnostic imaging services in the United States, with 137 owned or
operated freestanding, fixed-site outpatient diagnostic imaging centers. Our centers provide physicians with imaging
capabilities to facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of diseases and disorders in order to help reduce unnecessary
invasive procedures, determine the appropriate amount of care and minimize cost for patients. Our services include
magnetic resonance imaging (“MRI”), computed tomography (“CT”), positron emission tomography (“PET”),
ultrasound, X-ray and mammography as well as other diagnostic and interventional radiology procedures.

We seek to develop leading positions in regional markets in order to leverage operational efficiencies. Our 137
centers are located in eight states, including: Florida (79), Texas (23), Pennsylvania (14), Delaware (8), Georgia (6),
Illinois (3), Kansas (1), and Massachusetts (3). Our scale and density within selected geographies in the United
States drives long-term relationships with key payors, radiology groups, and referring physicians. Our operations
team is dedicated to meeting high standards of patient care, managing relationships with local patients, physicians
and payors, and improving profitability. We provide corporate training programs, standardize policies and
procedures, and share best practices among the physicians in our regional networks so that they can be implemented.

Our scalable and integrated operating platform supports our ability to drive organic growth, realize cost efficiencies,
and create value from integrating acquisitions. Strategic acquisitions and organic growth have helped us strengthen
our position in core geographies. Since our inception, we have successfully integrated more than 100 outpatient
diagnostic imaging centers into our platform. We believe our scale and track record of being able to achieve material
cost synergies enable us to successfully compete for acquisitions.

On June 25, 2021, we entered into an agreement to acquire Thaihot Investment Company US Limited, which owns
100% of the common stock of Alliance, from Thaihot Investment Co., LTD, for $820 million.

**Alliance Business Overview**

Alliance is a leading national provider of outsourced advanced radiology and radiation therapy services across 45
states in the United States Alliance partners with more than 1,000 hospitals, health systems, and physician practices
to provide a full continuum of solutions, including onsite outpatient services and comprehensive service line
management. Alliance delivers exceptional customer and patient care via more than 500 diagnostic radiology and
radiation therapy systems.

Alliance’s diagnostic imaging services are delivered through its Radiology Division. Alliance provides radiology
services through its hospital, health system and physician practice relationships, as well as through 19 independent,
freestanding outpatient imaging centers. We believe that Alliance’s Radiology Division is one of the nation’s
leading providers of MRI and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (“PET/CT”), with 67% and
18% of the division’s volume coming from MRI and PET/CT, respectively, for fiscal year 2020. Alliance provides
full-service, multi-modality radiology department and center management, including certified clinical staffing, dayto-day operations, sales and marketing, patient scheduling and pre-authorization, revenue cycle management, payor
relations, systems, equipment maintenance and upgrades. Alliance generally enters into long-term contracts or
partnerships with its health system, hospital and physician group partners.

Through its Oncology Division, Alliance operates 34 radiation oncology centers across 20 states. Alliance provides
a wide range of radiation therapy services and ancillary services for cancer patients, including: planning and

125


-----

preparation for treatment, simulation of treatment, delivery of radiation therapy, therapy management, and follow-up
care. Alliance offers various treatment options, including conventional, intensity-modulated and stereotactic body
radiation therapies and stereotactic radiosurgery using linear accelerator (“Linac”) and targeted robotic linear
accelerators (“SRS”). Alliance partners directly with hospitals, physicians, and other healthcare providers to offer a
full suite of services in cancer care including access to the latest radiation oncology technologies, full management
of its partners’ cancer care programs including clinical staffing, access to its national network of physicists for
training and development on new treatment protocols and technologies, market analysis, equipment and capital, preauthorization and billing, marketing and sales, and operational management.

**Overview of Combined Company**

We believe that the combined company will offer the most comprehensive radiology and oncology solutions to
patients in the United States, with more than 1,000 hospital and health system customers, 156 independent outpatient
radiology centers and 34 radiation therapy centers. The combined company will operate in 46 states and will have
more than 4,000 team members expected to serve more than 2 million radiology and oncology patient visits
annually.


**Combined Company Geographic Footprint**


The combined company will be significantly diversified across business lines, geographies, modality offerings, and
reimbursement sources. The enhanced diversity of the combined company’s business provides a number of
advantages, including having no material revenue concentration with any health system or hospital customer and no
material concentration with any commercial payor. We expect to generate approximately 52% of our revenue
through services provided for health systems and hospitals which are typically under multi-year contracts with either
fixed fee or per procedure arrangements. The remaining 48% of our revenue is expected to be billed directly to
payors, including commercial payors, Medicare, Medicaid, and other payors. Although 52% of our combined
revenue is expected to come directly from hospitals or health systems, the combined company will be an outpatient
focused service platform as we expect that substantially all revenues are to be generated from outpatient visits. This
focus aligns with the overall shift in the industry to outpatient care.

Below is our payor mix on a combined basis for the year-ended December 31, 2020 and offering and reimbursement
mix on a combined basis for the twelve months ended March 31, 2021.

126


-----

**Combined Company Geographic Footprint**


For the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, after giving pro forma effect to the Acquisition, we would have
generated revenue of $730 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $213 million, including $24 million in estimated
synergies. See “Summary Pro Forma and Historical Consolidated Financial Information and Other Data –
_Akumin” and “Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information.”_

_Acquisition Strategic Rationale_

Akumin’s rationale for the Acquisition is based on the following benefits Akumin expects to result from the
combination with Alliance:

  - _Creates the national partner of choice for health systems and hospitals with comprehensive solutions_
_addressing all of their outpatient radiology and oncology needs. We believe that the combined company_
will have one of the country’s most comprehensive offerings of MRI procedure, PET/CT procedure, and
radiation therapy services. The combination enhances our ability to provide a full suite of outpatient
services (and expertise in a variety of site and care environments) to hospital and health system customers
across the U.S.

  - _Leverage complementary skills and expertise of each organization. The combined company will apply its_
respective expertise to enhance patient experience and outcomes, while advancing industry trends towards
outpatient, price-transparent, value-based care. The combination brings together both organizations’
expertise in delivering outpatient care, along with Alliance’s expertise in forming partnerships with health
systems and hospitals and Akumin’s freestanding operational expertise.

  - _Expands our presence in the attractive oncology market: Alliance is a leading provider of oncology_
services, which is complementary to and dependent upon diagnostic radiology services. Oncology patients
often require advanced imaging for effective screening diagnosis, staging, treatment and management of
recurrence. We expect the outpatient oncology services that the combined company will be able to offer
will complement the radiology services offering. Together, we believe these radiology and oncology
services will provide an attractive suite of services that address key outpatient needs of hospital and health
systems. In addition, our patients will have available to them a wide array of cancer care needs inclusive of
both advanced diagnostic imaging and radiation therapy modalities, as well as emerging and
complementary new technologies.

**Industry Overview**

_Radiology Overview_

Radiology represents an essential capability of a hospital or health system, driving and influencing many
downstream care processes across multiple medical service lines. Radiology services are utilized across virtually all
disease categories in early, rapid and accurate detection, diagnosis, treatment planning and monitoring, and directly
impact high focus areas such as patient safety, patient experience, length of hospital stay and downstream healthcare
resource utilization. Radiology services also play a critical role in providing quality and efficient healthcare, as
nearly every individual in the United States will require some form of diagnostic imaging and resulting radiology
interpretation for a significant clinical indication during his or her lifetime.

As a result of this widespread adoption, healthcare systems across the world and their affiliated physicians rely on
efficient and effective radiology operations as well as concise and timely radiologist interpretations to make a fully
informed care decisions and to keep their hospital and outpatient operations running smoothly and efficiently.

In diagnostic radiology, the typical patient journey includes (i) a referral from a physician, who orders an exam to
assist with diagnosing or treating a condition, (ii) the procurement of the diagnostic image, usually carried out by a
technologist specialized in the particular procedure or modality, and (iii) an interpretation from a radiologist who
reads and interprets the images and produces a report of their findings and recommendations, which is provided
back to the referring physician for use in the next step of the patient’s care. The referring physician often consults
with the radiologist to choose the appropriate modality, which could include advanced imaging techniques such as
MRI, CT, and PET, or routine imaging techniques such as X-Ray, mammography, ultrasound, fluoroscopy, or
nuclear medicine.

Medical imaging technologies continue to evolve and play a critical role in cost-effective patient diagnosis and
treatment. While X-rays are the most common imaging procedure, more sophisticated and higher reimbursement
procedures, such as MRI, CT and PET scans are the fastest growing.

Radiology exams can be performed at a hospital’s main radiology department or in an outpatient setting, including a
hospital outpatient departments, physician offices or independent diagnostic testing facilities. Outpatient diagnostic
imaging centers are primarily used to provide medical imaging services to patients who are ambulatory (meaning,
they are not in the ER or inpatient) and who have been referred by a third-party physician. Standard offerings
include screening and diagnostic imaging procedures such as X-ray, mammography and ultrasound along with more
complex and costly services, such as MRI, CT and PET, in addition to other diagnostic and interventional radiology
procedures.

Outpatient diagnostic imaging is generally more cost effective compared to imaging performed in the traditional inpatient or on-campus hospital setting. We believe that this dynamic, combined with the convenience of outpatient
care for patients, will result in outpatient imaging growth outpacing the overall radiology market. The gap in pricing
between traditional hospital in-patient facilities and freestanding outpatient facilities has been a significant area of
focus for government and third-party payors, who in an effort to curtail costs, have adopted over time a number of
policies to drive price transparent, site-neutral reimbursements for advanced outpatient imaging procedures, and
steerage to lower-cost, outpatient entities. Payors have also increased requirements for pre-authorization of advanced
diagnostic procedures in an effort to ensure the medical necessity of those procedures. We anticipate that these
trends will continue to drive procedure volume toward outpatient settings —both freestanding and hospital—
outpatient. We believe these trends will drive a need for hospitals and health systems to engage service providers
such as the combined company to provide services and support to build their outpatient radiology capabilities.

The size of the freestanding outpatient diagnostic imaging market in the United States is estimated at more than $19
billion in annual industry revenue. The diagnostic imaging market is highly competitive, consisting of owneroperator radiologists, freestanding outpatient diagnostic imaging centers, and hospitals. We also face competition
from other diagnostic imaging companies in acquiring diagnostic imaging centers. There are estimated to be more
than 6,000 freestanding outpatient diagnostic imaging centers in the United States. The landscape in the outpatient

128


-----

diagnostic imaging industry is highly fragmented. Other significant radiology businesses in the United States include
RadNet, US Radiology Specialists, SimonMed, RAYUS and MedQuest.

We believe the outpatient diagnostic imaging industry will remain stable for the foreseeable future. Contributing to
this outlook is the expectation of stable Medicare reimbursement rates. After a downward trend in reimbursement
from 2007 to 2014, Medicare reimbursements have generally stabilized. From 2015 to 2020, there has been limited
fluctuation in Medicare reimbursements.


**Medicare Fee Schedule Trends (Top 5 MRI CPT Codes, 2000-2020)**


In addition to a stable Medicare reimbursement outlook, which we believe is often used as a benchmark in the
industry, we also believe the industry will see increasing imaging volumes. Since becoming a mainstream medical
diagnostic mechanism in the 1990’s, utilization of diagnostic imaging has drastically increased. Over the last few
decades, the imaging industry has developed significantly through improvements in technology, the development of
various outpatient imaging sites of service, and the continued increase in the number of patients seeking out imaging
procedures for both screening and diagnosis. Large outpatient imaging center operators, such as Akumin, are in a
position to benefit from these industry dynamics. Scale, reputation and operating excellence will likely be key
drivers of performance for the various industry players.

There are a number of factors that we believe will drive the growth of the radiology industry, including:

  - _Aging demographics: The number of people over the age of 65 in the United States is expected to increase_
significantly, largely owing to the subset of aging baby boomers. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the
“65+” population will outnumber individuals under the age of 18 by 2034. As the overall U.S. population
continues to age, the need for affordable and easily accessible healthcare procedures will expand
proportionally. According to the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) in 2014,
senior citizens, defined as those who are 65 years old or older, made up only 13% of the total U.S.
population, yet accounted for 34% of healthcare-related spending. The vast growth in the elderly
population is expected to positively impact the financial landscape of the overall healthcare industry.

  - _Greater Consumer Awareness for Earlier Intervention and Preventative Screening: Greater consumer_
awareness for early intervention and increased emphasis on preventive screening have changed the
perception of imaging from a luxury service to an essential part of the diagnostic process. Commercial

129


-----

payors are encouraging the appropriate use of diagnostic imaging and of preventative screenings to help
decrease overall costs by reducing more expensive procedures over the long-run.

  - _Technological Advances Leading to More Use Cases for Radiology: We believe that further technological_
advancements will allow for even earlier diagnosis of diseases and disorders through less invasive methods,
further driving demand for diagnostic imaging services. Additionally, the industry is seeing a shift towards
the adoption of innovative technology in areas such as Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) which has the potential
to transform diagnostic imaging and help with early diagnosis.

_Oncology Overview_

Radiation therapy is the practice of delivering ionizing radiation to treat malignant and benign disease processes
under the direction of a radiation oncologist. Radiation therapy is primarily used to treat cancer patients, as it kills
cancer cells and shrink tumors via the highest possible dose of radiation, in order to destroy the cancerous cells
while minimizing exposure to healthy surrounding tissue.

Alliance specializes in the deployment and utilization of two primary radiation therapy modalities: Linac and
targeted, robotic linear accelerators (“SRS”). Both are utilized to treat the most common and some of the most
deadly cancers in the U.S., including breast, lung, prostate, colon, melanoma and brain cancer. Linac can perform
different types of treatments, including conventional, intensity-modulated and stereotactic body radiation therapies
via treatments that are often lower doses over more sessions and weeks. Some Linacs can provide stereotactic
radiosurgery as well. SRS is specifically designed to treat tumors using stereotactic radiosurgery, which delivers
higher doses and shorter course treatments given over several days.

Demand for cancer care is large and growing. Radiation therapy services are essential to cancer care, with
approximately 66% of cancer patients receiving radiation therapy as a part of their cancer care. As a result, the
radiation therapy market is significant, with an estimated size of $3 billion and annual growth estimated in the midsingle-digits. There are more than 2,300 radiation therapy centers across the country.

Radiation therapy treatment relies on the execution of technical services coordinated with professional physician and
clinician services. There are a number of highly trained professionals involved in the workflow. Care is led by the
radiation oncologist, a specially trained physician who works with other physicians and the full radiation therapy
staff to oversee each patient’s treatment and coordinates the most appropriate radiation therapy approach for each
patient. The medical physicist assures the accurate delivery of all aspects of treatment, oversees dosimetrists, and
ensures that treatments are properly planned specifically for each patient. The dosimetrist designs the treatment plan
(including dose distributions and calculations) for a prescribed course of therapy. This includes all specific dose
calculations for each patient. The radiation therapist administers radiation therapy to patients via the specified
equipment and monitors the patient during treatment. The radiation oncology nurse works with the patient and care
team to provide support, care and resources before, during and after treatment. The center staff are team members
who support clinical care and operations, which can include front desk staff, site administrators, navigators and
others.

There are a number of different Medicare payment methodologies for radiation therapy based on the site of service.
Sites operating as an integrated department of the hospital are reimbursed under the Hospital Outpatient Prospective
Payment System (“HOPPS”). Freestanding outpatient radiation therapy providers are reimbursed under the
Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (“MPFS”). Reimbursement rates are typically higher for procedures performed at
a hospital outpatient department (“HOPD”), which are off-campus outpatient centers that are clinically and
financially integrated with the hospital. In recent years, there has been a shift towards site-neutral payments by
lowering payments to HOPDs. In the 2019 final rule, CMS set reimbursement rates for certain HOPD centers equal
to 40% of HOPPS beginning in 2020, with an exception for certain HOPD centers that billed under HOPPS prior to
November 2, 2015.

The oncology segment of the combined company will derive revenue from both HOPPS and MPFS. Approximately
two-thirds of revenue is billed to the health system or hospital partner under contractual arrangements and the

130


-----

remaining one-third of revenue is billed directly to the payor. For sites that are contracted with hospitals or health
systems, the majority of centers fall under HOPPS. These centers are not subject to some of the recent developments
related to despite the shift to site neutrality, since these centers have either been “grandfathered in” (have been
billing under HOPPS since prior to 2015) or are located on the hospital property. For sites that bill payors directly,
the vast majority of sites bill under MPFS.

Radiation therapy reimbursement has generally remained stable across both Akumin’s and Alliance’s key areas of
service, while site neutrality rules are expected to have minimal impact. Below are the changes in HOPPS and
MPFS reimbursement rates for the last several years.

In December 2015, Congress passed the Patient Access and Medicare Protection Act, which sought to develop an
episodic alternative payment model for radiation therapy services. This resulted in the Radiation Oncology (“RO”)
model, which aims to improve the quality of care for patients while moving towards a simplified and predictable
payment system. The program is expected to go into effect on January 1, 2022 and cover periods through December
2025 for a select set of geographies and 16 disease states representing approximately 30% of eligible episodes. The
model will reimburse providers based on prospective, site neutral, episode-based payments for 90-day episodes.
Participants will be paid in two installments per episode (beginning and end) with reimbursement split into
professional (fee for physician services) and technical components (fee for use of the facility). The program also
includes the reporting of performance on quality measures, clinical data, and patient experience, which will be
factored into payments. We believe that our focus on clinical quality, operational efficiency, and value-based care,
as well as our integrated service line approach, position us well for the new reimbursement model.

**Competitive Strengths**

**_Comprehensive radiology and oncology solutions provider_**

The acquisition of Alliance will enable us to deliver a full suite of outsourced outpatient solutions to hospital, health
system and physician group partners. We believe that radiology and oncology are highly complementary business
lines and there are a number of efficiencies to being able to offer both for our customers. Both radiology and
oncology are clinically sophisticated, critical service lines for hospitals. As a result, hospitals often rely on third
parties to provide these services, and would benefit from being able to procure both services from a single provider.
Providing both services also results in valuable referral network benefits, enables care management opportunities,
and opens the possibility of cost-based initiatives for oncology care. There is often overlap in the radiology and
oncology patient base, since oncology patients require advanced imaging for effective diagnosis and staging
efficient treatment and management of recurrence.

In addition to the clinical benefits of offering both services, the business models of radiology and oncology are
highly complementary. Both businesses are outpatient oriented, providing for significant health system partnership
opportunities and complementary business development approaches. Both specialties have an impact on referral and

131


-----

patient care journeys and are administratively complex, which represent a key pain point for hospital administrators.
In addition, offering both specialties allows us to take advantage of shared infrastructure, including physician
outreach, strategic marketing, operations, quality and safety, logistics and supply chain, patient scheduling and prior
authorizations, payor relations and contracting, revenue cycle management, accounting and finance, IT, HR, legal,
compliance, and others.

**_Well positioned to take advantage of long-term industry tailwinds_**

We are well positioned to take advantage of many of the long-term trends in healthcare. In recent years, there has
been an enhanced focus on patient experience and customer service. We pride ourselves on a commitment to
excellence and patient satisfaction, including offering quality service, short wait and turnaround times,
compassionate care and convenience to all patients. Our scale and operational expertise enable us to access the latest
advances in technology and information systems and to offer hospital-level expertise within a local setting. Other
trends in healthcare that will benefit us include an increased focus on early detection, strict standards for clinical
quality, measurable patient satisfaction and clinical care productivity and efficiency. Our ability to offer both
radiology and oncology services puts us in a unique position to help detect and accurately diagnose cancer, and to
guide and deliver more targeted, efficient and effective treatments. In addition, our proven approach to improving
operational performance and best-in-class operational infrastructure allows us to deliver care efficiently with high
productivity.

We are well positioned to take advantage of the continued shift in care from inpatient to outpatient as payors and
patients increase their focus on increasing access and convenience and reducing costs. Our longstanding, shared
focus on outpatient care delivery in both hospital and freestanding facilities offers unique expertise for hospitals,
health systems and physician groups. As pressure to move to lower-cost sites of care increases for hospitals, our
ability to assist them with both on and off-campus outpatient solutions will be impactful, as well as our ability to
provide freestanding expertise in convenient locations, with shorter wait times, increased likelihood of subspecialty
interpretations and faster turnaround times.

**_Stable and diversified revenue base_**

We benefit from a well-diversified stream of revenues that span multiple service offerings, geographies, modality
offerings, and physician networks. Pro forma for the Acquisition, we expect we will derive approximately 80% of
our revenue from radiology and 20% of our revenue from oncology. We believe that our diversified service offering
enables us to better serve our health system and hospital partners and offer “one-stop-shopping” for administrators
charged with finding better outsourced solutions.

Pro forma for the Acquisition, our revenue is diversified by payor source, with 52% of revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2020 generated from health systems and hospitals, 32% generated from commercial managed care,
8% from Medicare, 1% from Medicaid and 7% from other sources. We have no material revenue concentration in
any health system or hospital customer or from any commercial insurance payor. We believe that this diversity in
revenue sources decreases the risk to our business from the loss of any single customer or payor relationship, or
changes to reimbursement rates from any single payor.

Where we bill payors directly, we are also in-network with substantially all of our commercial payors and believe
we are the ideal imaging partner for payors who seek to provide high quality care to patients at a low cost. By
partnering with the vast majority of all major payors in our geographic footprint, we are able to provide significant
savings to our payor partners by ensuring patients stay within their networks using our system of conveniently
located facilities. Payor reimbursement levels are negotiated via contracts with each individual payor. These
contracts allow for separate reimbursement schedules for each of the payor’s respective clients, depending on the
members’ individual coverage plan.

Within our radiology segment, we leverage a large network of radiologists, with some radiologists working on-site
and others working remotely. Given our vast network of radiologists and dynamic IT platform, we do not rely
heavily on any single radiologist to drive business. Our scale and density within selected geographies allows us to

132


-----

create close, long-term relationships with local radiology groups and referring physicians. In addition, our multimodality imaging offering provides a one-stop-shop for patients and referring physicians.

**_Partner of choice for health systems_**

The combined company has developed deep, long-standing relationships with over 1,000 hospitals and healthcare
providers across the country. We are partnered with 25 of the 30 largest U.S. health systems. Our customers are
health systems and hospitals seeking best-in-class partners to enable a capital efficient network and to expand their
U.S. essential outpatient radiology and oncology services.

We believe that healthcare trends will foster hospital- and health-system-centric models even as shifts to lower-cost
outpatient care continue, and will allow the combined company to expand its platform. As hospitals consolidate and
seek partners with regional or national scale and expertise in different clinical settings, the combined company’s
national footprint enables it to leverage its position as a trusted partner to expand its services as an outsourced
service partner. We are focused on building around the hospital’s existing network, patients and partnerships to
assist our partners in delivering a full continuum of care within our communities; this legacy of hospital partnering
will enable the combined company to take advantage of favorable healthcare industry trends such as increasingly
higher hospital expenditures, growing elderly population, higher cancer incidences, and increased patient flows to
hospitals resulting from health system integrations, industry consolidation, and increased covered lives under the
Affordable Care Act.

Additionally, the industry is seeing a shift towards outsourced clinical services. Currently, we estimate that
approximately 90% of hospitals already outsource, or are considering outsourcing, one or more services, and we
estimate that expenditures by hospitals on outsourced services are growing by at least 5% per year. These market
trends will drive demand for services, enabling the combined company to capitalize on its hospital-centric strategy,
providing a platform for expansion.

**_Culture driven by “deep” integration_**

Akumin has significant experience in successfully integrating acquisitions, with more than 100 outpatient diagnostic
imaging centers integrated into our platform to date, excluding the Alliance acquisition. Our integration philosophy
is based on a culture of innovation and standardization of processes.

Given our significant expertise in integrating acquisitions historically, we anticipate a smooth integration process
with Alliance. We expect to achieve the integration through three phases. Phase one will focus on the integration of
all business functions and we expect such integration to be completed within 6 months. We believe that we will be
able to achieve $24 million of cost synergies by the end of phase two, consisting of, among other things, integration
of corporate, field and back office functions and equipment maintenance overhaul. Phase three of the integration
will focus on the opportunity over the longer-term. We plan on consolidating the business into one radiology
segment and one oncology segment. We also plan on integrating the go-to-market strategy, positioning the company
as a comprehensive provider of outsourced solutions.

**_Consumer driven brand development_**

We believe there is a strong cultural fit between the Akumin and Alliance organizations given the mutual focus on
having the consumer or patient at the heart of the company’s strategy. The combined company’s brand will be
defined by intentional engagement with critical decision makers, including a consistent focus on the consumer
(including current or future patients, as well as patients’ loved ones). The consumer is at the heart of our strategy as
increasing out of pocket costs, price transparency and access to sophisticated medical information online are
changing consumer behavior in healthcare services. This is evidenced by the emergence of high deductible health
plans. The percentage of U.S. workers enrolled in high deductible plans with a health savings account increased
from approximately 4% in 2007 to approximately 32% in 2019. Our commitment to outreach, compassionate care,
operational excellence and service delivery optimizes the consumer’s experience at our clinics.

133


-----

We provide a consistent patient experience, standardized through technology and investments in our people and
processes. All patient facing employees are trained on delivering our brand promises by way of our intentional
values, as well as our policies and procedures. Our brand strategy is focused on aligning our position in the market
for the needs of our patients and partners, so that we are the go-to provider of outpatient diagnostic imaging and/or
radiation therapy services to patients in our service areas. We strive to provide shorter waiting times, convenient
locations, competitive pricing, compassionate and high-quality clinical care, quality equipment and software,
concise interpretations by subspecialty radiologists and top-tier expertise and consistency.

**Business Strategy**

**_Continued strong organic volume growth_**

Our organic growth strategy is based on a sales and marketing platform which utilizes relationships with local
referring physicians and consumer engagement to drive new business. To ensure the continued strength of
relationships with referring physicians, we employ a field-based sales team whose primary responsibility is
establishing new relationships and maintaining existing relationships with referring physicians. Relationships with
new referring physicians are developed through our value proposition (i.e. consistent service, excellent patient care
and referring provider communications, contracts with substantially all payors, convenience and access to top
subspecialty radiologists and radiation oncologists). Existing relationships are maintained by ensuring we continue
to deliver our value proposition in a consistent manner. We stress the importance of operational excellence which
ultimately manifests itself in a better patient experience.

To ensure continuous engagement with the community — including consumers, patients and their loved ones — we
deploy a number of market-specific, direct-to-consumer marketing and communications strategies, focused largely
on digital outreach (e.g., websites, search engine optimization, online reputation management, digital advertising
and social media) and addressing consumers’ most critical questions: how to decide, what to expect, how to prepare,
what they will pay and what will happen next. Our marketing strategies and tactics are coordinated through
centralized resources with expertise in specific areas and on a shared platform to ensure compliance with healthcare
marketing regulations.

Within our radiology segment, in markets with robust demand, we will consider adding modalities in centers that are
currently only single or dual modality centers. Multi-modality centers help diversify risk while contributing
positively to our margins and provide referring physicians with a “one-stop shop” for their patients. To attain growth
and offer a competitive differentiator in key markets, we will also consider replacing or adding new technologies
and equipment. While reimbursement rates may not change with newer equipment, we believe this strategy, in
particularly competitive markets, will offer us a market advantage which will ultimately lead to increased volumes.
An example of this is our investment in 3D digital mammography, which is preferred by many women (who can
self-refer for mammography) and is now being reimbursed by many of the large national insurance payors in
addition to Medicare.

The table below shows year-over-year RVU growth for Akumin on a same-center basis excluding the 2020
Acquisitions (as defined below) and the 2019 Acquisitions (as defined below), except for the acquisition of a single
outpatient diagnostic imaging center in Davie, Florida and pro-rating for the acquisition of single outpatient
diagnostic imaging center in Deltona, Florida and the ADG Acquisitions (each as defined below).

radiation oncology treatment during the period, of 9,664, 9,580 and 9,714, respectively.

The chart below shows historical revenues for Alliance for fiscal years 2016 to 2020:

135


-----

**_Cross-sell opportunities_**

We plan to take advantage of cross-sell opportunities of additional services to existing customers. In particular, we
believe that there is a significant competitive advantage to offering both radiology and oncology services to our
hospital customers. Offering both services allows our hospital partners to procure multiple outsourced outpatient
solutions from a single, high-quality provider. We plan to leverage our health system and hospital partnerships in
radiology to cross-sell oncology services and vice-versa.

A few years ago, Alliance made the decision to better integrate its radiology and oncology sales and business
development teams, who now regularly coordinate and collaborate their hospital efforts. We plan to continue and
further strengthen, this sales strategy, with a focus on selling an entire suite of outpatient solutions rather than single
specialty services.

**_Form new hospital partnerships_**

We believe there is an opportunity to enhance existing and form new hospital partnerships as hospitals continue to
accelerate the development of their outpatient care strategies. We believe that these enhancements could result in
enhanced volume growth at existing centers, and the new relationships could result in the potential to open or
service new centers. We plan to leverage the Alliance expertise in forming new, and growing existing, hospital
partnerships.

**_Proven acquisition strategy_**

We have significant experience in acquiring and integrating business into our platform, improving the operational
performance of those businesses, and realizing synergies. Our acquisition strategy is led by our President and Chief
Executive Officer, Riadh Zine. Mr. Zine has grown Akumin through a carefully executed, highly acquisitive,
strategy based on a distinct set of criteria: (i) market density, (ii) market growth potential, (iii) operational
integration potential, (iv) assets and compliance assessment, and (v) attractive valuation multiples. We look to
acquire individual or portfolios of centers that have a meaningful presence in their respective market and a high
potential for organic growth.

**Affiliated Physicians Groups**

In some states, we are affiliated with medical practices organized in traditional practice group structures which
operate certain of our imaging clinics. In accordance with applicable state laws, these affiliated practice groups are
responsible for the provision of medical care to patients at the imaging centers operated by those affiliated practice
groups. Most of our other imaging centers are organized as independent diagnostic testing facilities or “IDTFs”. Our
affiliated practice groups are separate legal entities organized under state law generally as limited liability

136


-----

companies but could also be organized as business corporations, professional associations, professional corporations
or partnerships. Each of our affiliated physician groups is owned by one or more licensed physicians affiliated with
us through employment or another contractual relationship.

Our affiliated physician practices employ or engage radiologists and other medical professionals to provide clinical
services at certain of our imaging centers. In most of our affiliated physician groups, the physicians who own the
equity in the affiliated physician group have entered into a contractual relationship with us which provide for
restrictions on the transfer of such equity interest.

Further, many states have laws that prohibit or restrict the ability for business corporations, like Akumin, from
practicing medicine, employing physicians to practice medicine, exercising control over medical decisions by
physicians, or engaging in certain arrangements, such as fee splitting, with physicians. In light of these restrictions,
we operate certain of our imaging centers by maintaining long-term administrative management services contracts
through our subsidiaries with affiliated physician groups. Under the terms of these services contracts, our subsidiary
has been engaged as the exclusive manager and provider of the affiliated physician group’s administrative and nonclinical affairs. Subject to applicable state laws and other regulations, our subsidiary provides services as manager
for the affiliated physician group, which services typically include billing patients and third-party payors, providing
and maintaining medical equipment and, procuring non-clinical staff and performing other back-office
administrative services. Under the terms of our management agreements with the affiliated physician groups,
Akumin, or its affiliate, is typically paid for its services based on the performance of the applicable affiliated
physician group. Our subsidiaries do not represent that they offer medical services and do not exercise influence or
control over the practice of medicine by the physicians employed or engaged by the affiliated physician groups.

**Seasonality**

The seasonality in our business usually leads to lower first calendar quarter revenue and profitability from typically
weaker utilization of services. Our business is also affected by the hurricane season which may impact our
operations in coastal regions, particularly in Florida; however, we seek to mitigate disruptions as a result of
hurricane damage through insurance coverage. Our geographic diversification across the Northeast, Southeast and
Central United States helps to diminish such seasonality risks.

**Competition**

The market for diagnostic imaging services is highly competitive. We compete principally on the basis of our
reputation, our ability to provide multiple modalities at many of our centers, the location of our centers and the
quality of our diagnostic imaging services. In the markets in which we are operating, or anticipate operating, we
compete locally with groups of radiologists, established hospitals, clinics and other independent organizations that
own and operate imaging equipment.

**Compliance and Internal Controls**

We are subject to a range of state and federal regulatory laws and statutes. Compliance and related internal controls
are managed by our Chief Compliance Officer, who chairs our Compliance Committee. The Compliance Committee
has oversight with respect to the following matters:

    - audit compliance in marketing, operations, billing, clinical, information technology, exclusions checks,
human resources and quarterly compliance checks vis-à-vis the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and
Clinical Health Act of 2009, and regulations implemented thereunder (collectively, “HIPAA”). These
audits encompass members of our leadership teams within these areas and provide information related
to compliance with specific statutes, including the False Claims Act, the Anti-Kickback Statute,
HIPAA, the Stark Law and the state equivalent of the Stark Law and other similar statutes. The
Compliance Committee analyzes this information to recommend and implement solutions;

    - risk analysis for each of above areas (completed quarterly). This analysis focuses on regulatory
compliance and is used for building the structure of audits for each area. Items identified are assigned

137


-----

scores which include likelihood of occurrence, resulting impact of occurrence and trending data for
mitigating risk;

    - oversight to investigations and trends within compliance program (ongoing). The Chief Compliance
Officer guides his team regarding investigations and, where appropriate, completes these investigations
directly and reports findings to both the Compliance Committee and the Compliance Board;

    - review and modify policies and procedures, as needed (ongoing); and

    - review and modify company training (ongoing).

Our compliance program also includes annual training for Compliance Committee members, a compliance hotline
and compliance management software.

Our internal controls for mitigating regulatory risk include:

    - policies and procedures which address specific compliance issues, including marketing, operations,
and compliance with specific statutes such as the False Claims Act, the Anti-Kickback Statute,
HIPAA, the Stark Law and other similar statutes;

    - training and education of employees on prevention of fraud and abuse, including with respect to
HIPAA. One of the basic tools of this training is our Code of Conduct;

    - employee-specific training provided for different job titles within our company to address risks
pertaining to their role;

    - training provided to employees through our compliance management software platform which
provides information including training reports for individual employees;

    - management of a company-wide compliance hotline. Employees are trained to use it any time they see
or suspect compliance issues. This hotline is available via phone, email, and fax and employees can
maintain complete anonymity without fear of retaliation;

    - having a Compliance Committee and a Compliance Board; and

    - having a Chief Compliance Officer and other compliance staff.

**Healthcare Laws**

**_The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute_**

Federal law known as the Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or
receipt of any form of remuneration in return for, or to induce, the referral of a person, the furnishing or arranging
for the furnishing of items or services reimbursable under the Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs
or the purchase, lease or order or arranging or recommending purchasing, leasing or ordering of any item or service
reimbursable under the Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad,
and it prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry.
The OIG has issued regulations as "safe harbor" guidelines which if met in form and substance, will assure
healthcare providers that they will not be prosecuted for violation of the Anti–Kickback Statute. Although full
compliance with these provisions ensures against prosecution under the federal Anti–Kickback Statute, the failure of
a transaction or arrangement to fit within a specific safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the transaction or
arrangement is illegal or that prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute will be pursued. However, the
government can exercise enforcement discretion in taking action against activities that are not protected by a safe
harbor. Further, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate
it. Penalties for violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute include, but are not limited to, criminal, civil and/or
administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from Medicare,
Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Exclusion would mean that our diagnostic imaging tests and

138


-----

interventional radiology procedures would no longer be eligible for reimbursement under federal healthcare
programs.

**_Stark Law_**

The Stark Law prohibits a physician from referring Medicare patients to an entity providing designated health
services in which the physician (or immediate family member) has an ownership or investment interest or with
which the physician (or immediate family member) has entered into a compensation arrangement. The Stark Law
also prohibits the entity from billing for any such prohibited referral. Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include,
but are not limited to, the denial of Medicare payment for services provided in violation of the prohibition, refunds
of amounts collected by the entity in violation of the Stark Law, civil penalties, and possible exclusion from
Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs.

Under the Stark Law, radiology and certain other imaging services and radiation therapy services and supplies are
services included in the designated health services subject to the self-referral prohibition. Such services include the
professional and technical components of any diagnostic test or procedure using X-rays, ultrasound or other imaging
services, CT, MRI, radiation therapy and diagnostic mammography services (but not screening mammography
services). PET and nuclear medicine procedures are also included as designated health services under the Stark Law.
The Stark Law, however, excludes from designated health services: (i) X-ray, fluoroscopy or ultrasound procedures
that require the insertion of a needle, catheter, tube or probe through the skin or into a body orifice; (ii) radiology
procedures that are integral to the performance of, and performed during, non-radiological medical procedures; and
(iii) invasive or interventional radiology, because the radiology services in these procedures are merely incidental or
secondary to another procedure that the physician has ordered.

The Stark Law provides that a request by a radiologist for diagnostic radiology services or a request by a radiation
oncologist for radiation therapy, if such services are furnished by or under the supervision of such radiologist or
radiation oncologist pursuant to a consultation requested by another physician, does not constitute a referral by a
referring physician. If such requirements are met, the Stark Law self-referral prohibition would not apply to such
services. The effect of the Stark Law on the radiology practices, therefore, will depend on the precise scope of
services furnished by each such practice’s radiologists and whether such services derive from consultations or are
self-generated.

**_Federal False Claims Act_**

The Federal False Claims Act prohibits a person from knowingly presenting, or caused to be presented, a false or
fraudulent request for payment from the federal government, or from making a false statement or using a false
record to get a claim approved. The federal False Claims Act further provides that a lawsuit thereunder may be
initiated in the name of the United States by an individual, a “whistleblower,” who is an original source of the
allegations. In recent years, the number of suits brought against healthcare providers by private individuals has
increased dramatically. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting
from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute or the Stark Law constitutes a false or fraudulent claim
for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. No specific intent to defraud is required under the Federal False Claims
Act. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the
federal Anti-Kickback Statute or the Stark Law constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False
Claims Act. When an entity is determined to have violated the Federal False Claims Act, it may be required to pay
up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties for each separate instance of
false claim, and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. The criminal
False Claims Act provides for criminal penalties for submitting false claims, including imprisonment and criminal
fines.

**_State Law Equivalents_**

Many states have adopted laws similar anti-kickback and false claims laws. Some of these state prohibitions apply to
referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
Although we believe that we comply with both federal and state anti-kickback laws, any finding of a violation of
these laws could subject us to criminal and civil penalties or possible exclusion from federal or state healthcare
programs. Such penalties would adversely affect our financial performance and our ability to operate our business.

**_Licensing and Certification Laws_**

Ownership, construction, operation, expansion and acquisition of diagnostic imaging facilities are subject to various
federal and state laws, regulations and approvals concerning licensing of facilities and personnel. In addition,
freestanding diagnostic imaging facilities that provide services not performed as part of a physician office must meet
Medicare requirements to be certified as an independent diagnostic testing facility before it can be authorized to bill
the Medicare program.

**_Radiologist Licensing_**

The radiologists providing professional medical services at our facilities are subject to licensing and related
regulations by the states in which they provide services. As a result, we require the radiology groups with which we
contract to require those radiologists to have and maintain appropriate licensure. We do not believe that such laws
and regulations will either prohibit or require licensure approval of our business operations, although no assurances
can be made that such laws and regulations will not be interpreted to extend such prohibitions or requirements to our
operations.

**_Corporate Practice of Medicine and Professional Fee-Splitting_**

Certain states prohibit a lay person or any entity other than a professional corporation or other similar professional
organization from practicing medicine, including by employing professional persons or by having any ownership
interest or profit participation in or control over any medical professional practice. The laws of such states also
prohibit a lay person or a non-professional entity from exercising control over the medical judgments or decisions of
physicians and from engaging in certain financial arrangements, such as splitting professional fees with physicians.
We structure our relationships with the radiology practices, including the purchase of diagnostic imaging facilities,
in a manner that we believe keeps us from engaging in the practice of medicine, exercising control over the medical
judgments or decisions of the radiology practices or their physicians, or violating the prohibitions against feesplitting.

**Data Privacy & Security Laws**

Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, including consumer protection laws and regulations, govern the
collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality and security of personal information, including healthrelated information. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data
breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws and
regulations (e.g., Section 5 of the FTC Act), that govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of healthrelated and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners. For example,
HIPAA imposes privacy, security and breach notification obligations on certain health care providers, health plans,
and health care clearinghouses, known as covered entities, as well as their business associates that perform certain
services that involve creating, receiving, maintaining or transmitting individually identifiable health information for
or on behalf of such covered entities. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a breach of
unsecured protected health information, a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by HHS, may be subject to
significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations
if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA
non-compliance. Further, entities that knowingly obtain, use, or disclose individually identifiable health information
maintained by a HIPAA covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA may be subject to
criminal penalties.

Even when HIPAA does not apply, according to the FTC, violating consumers’ privacy rights or failing to take
appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure may constitute unfair acts or practices in or
affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the FTC Act. The FTC expects a company’s data security
measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds,
the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities.
Individually identifiable health information is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards.

In addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some
of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not

140


-----

have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can
result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. For example, California
recently enacted the CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA, among other things, creates new
data privacy obligations for covered companies and provides new privacy rights to California residents, including
the right to opt out of certain disclosures of their information. The CCPA also creates a private right of action with
statutory damages for certain data breaches, thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach.
Further, the CPRA recently passed in California. The CPRA will impose additional data protection obligations on
covered businesses, including additional consumer rights processes, limitations on data uses, new audit requirements
for higher risk data, and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It will also create a new California data protection
agency authorized to issue substantive regulations and could result in increased privacy and information security
enforcement. The majority of the provisions will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and additional compliance
investment and potential business process changes may be required.

**Coverage and Reimbursement**

Our revenue is derived from a diverse mix of third-party payors, including private payors, managed care capitated
payors and government payors. We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from direct billings to governmental
healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and private health insurance companies and/or health plans,
including, but not limited to, those participating in the Medicare Advantage program. For services for which we bill
Medicare directly or indirectly, including through contracted radiologists, we are paid under the Medicare Physician
Fee Schedule. Medicaid rates are set by the individual states for each state program and Medicaid patients may be
responsible for a modest co-payment. Generally, commercial insurance companies reimburse us, directly or
indirectly, including through the contracted radiology groups elsewhere, on the basis of agreed upon rates. These
rates are negotiated and may differ materially with rates set forth in the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule for the
particular service. The patients may be responsible for certain co-payments or deductibles.

Government and private payors have taken and may continue to take steps to control the cost, eligibility for, use, and
delivery of healthcare services as a result of budgetary constraints, cost containment pressures and other reasons. For
example, reimbursement by government payors for a number of diagnostic imaging procedures has been materially
reduced over the last number of years. Certain private payors have followed suit and reduced reimbursement for
certain diagnostic imaging procedures. Further, CMS and other payors are seeking to shift from a primarily fee for
service reimbursement paradigm to a more value based model.

**Employees**

As at March 31, 2021, we had approximately 1,567 employees and Alliance had approximately 2,083 employees.

We employ site managers who are responsible for overseeing day-to-day and routine operations at each of our
outpatient diagnostic imaging centers, including staffing, modality and schedule coordination, referring physician
and patient relations and ordering of materials. These site managers report to regional directors, who are responsible
for oversight of the operations of all outpatient diagnostic imaging centers within their region, including operations,
marketing and contracting. The regional directors, along with our directors of contracting, marketing, facilities,
management/purchasing and human resources all report to our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating
Officer. Our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, and our Chief Financial Officer and Corporate
Secretary report directly to our President and Chief Executive Officer.

None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we have had no labor-related work
stoppages.

**Environmental and Corporate Responsibility**

Management seeks to keep individual and collective exposure to doses of radioactive materials and radiation sources
“as low as reasonably achievable” (or “ALARA”). The ALARA approach focuses on actively seeking out methods
to minimize radiation exposure.

141


-----

In addition to having established written policies, procedures and instructions to foster the ALARA concept, we
have a dedicated Radiation Safety Officer (“RSO”). The RSO performs quarterly and annual reviews and
implements changes driven by regulatory or industry requirements.

Modifications to procedures, equipment and facilities that could reduce radiation exposure are considered and
reviewed by the RSO with management annually. In addition to maintaining doses to individuals ALARA, the sum
of the doses received by all exposed individuals are also maintained ALARA. The RSO reviews the results of
personnel monitoring every quarter and addresses any increased levels.

Radioactive material licenses issued to Akumin are maintained by the RSO and reviewed by a contracted licensed
medical physicist every quarter. The radioactive materials held by us for equipment calibration and patient use are of
low level. None of our facilities release radioactive material into the environment. All radioactive waste is held for
storage in-house and decayed to background level prior to disposal.

Our Board has also adopted a written code of conduct (the “Code of Conduct”) that applies to all of our directors,
officers and employees. The objective of the Code of Conduct is to provide guidelines for maintaining our and our
subsidiaries’ integrity, reputation, honesty, objectivity and impartiality. The Code of Conduct addresses conflicts of
interest, protection of our assets, confidentiality, fair dealing with shareholders, competitors and employees, insider
trading, compliance with laws and reporting any illegal or unethical behavior. As part of the Code of Conduct, any
person subject to the Code of Conduct is required to avoid or fully disclose interests or relationships that are harmful
or detrimental to our best interests or that may give rise to real, potential or the appearance of conflicts of interest.
Our Board has ultimate responsibility for the stewardship of the Code of Conduct and monitors compliance through
our Governance Committee. Directors, officers and employees are required to annually certify that they have not
violated the Code of Conduct.

**Litigation**

We are, from time to time, involved in legal proceedings, regulatory actions and investigations of a nature
considered normal to our business. Health care companies are subject to numerous investigations by various
government agencies. In addition, private parties have the right to bring “qui tam”, or “whistleblower” suits against
companies under the FCA. On or about August 27, 2019, Akumin Inc. was served with a Civil Investigative
Demand from the DOJ, United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Delaware investigating whether our
operations in Delaware and Texas complied with the supervision requirements for MRI procedures and other
diagnostic imaging tests. In February 2021, we announced we had entered into a settlement with the DOJ pursuant
to which we made a payment of $749,600. The settlement does not constitute a finding of improper conduct or
failure to provide appropriate care and treatment in accordance with governing rules and regulations or an admission
of facts or liability by us or any of our subsidiaries or professional service affiliates. We believe that none of the
litigation and investigations in which we are currently involved, or have been involved since the beginning of the
most recently completed financial year, individually or in the aggregate, is material to our consolidated financial
condition or results of operations, nor are any such proceedings known by us to be contemplated. See further
discussion under “Risk Factors” above.

**Corporate Integrity Agreements**

Prior to our acquisition of Akumin Texas, PIC, then a wholly-owned subsidiary of Akumin Texas which was
merged into Akumin Texas effective September 30, 2017, was the subject of an investigation by the DOJ premised
upon an allegation that PIC and its affiliates violated U.S. federal law by performing and billing for certain imaging
services without on-site physician supervision. In or about June, 2016, PIC entered into a no-fault settlement
agreement with the DOJ with respect to those allegations, which included PIC paying $3.5 million to the U.S.
government and entering into a CIA with the OIG. PIC’s CIA expired June 29, 2021, and as of the date of this
offering memorandum PIC is completing its reporting with respect to the final year of that CIA. We expect to
receive notice that we have closed the Akumin Texas CIA in the third quarter of 2021.

The compliance measures and the reporting and auditing requirements contained in the CIAs include:

    - continuing the duties and activities of the Compliance Officer and Compliance Committee;

142


-----

    - maintaining written policies and procedures addressing matters included in our Compliance Program;

    - continuing general compliance training;

    - engaging an independent third party to perform an annual review of our compliance with the CIAs;

    - continuing the confidential disclosure program and hotline to enable employees or others to disclose
issues or questions regarding possible inappropriate policies or behavior;

    - continuing the screening program to ensure that we do not hire or engage employees or contractors
who are ineligible persons for federal healthcare programs;

    - reporting any material deficiency which resulted in an overpayment to us by a federal healthcare
program; and submitting annual reports to the OIG which describe in detail the operations of the
corporate Compliance Program.

Material, uncorrected violations of the CIA could lead to our exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid
and other federal and state healthcare programs. In addition, we are subject to possible civil penalties for failure to
substantially comply with the terms of the CIA, including stipulated penalties ranging between $1,000 and $2,500
per day. We are also subject to a stipulated penalty of $50,000 for each false certification made by us or on our
behalf, pursuant to the reporting provisions of the CIA. The CIA increases the amount of information we must
provide to the federal government regarding our practices at our healthcare facilities and our compliance with
federal regulations. The reports we provide in connection with the CIA could result in greater scrutiny by other
regulatory agencies.

Given the broad powers of the DOJ and other federal agencies, there can be no assurance that the obligations of
Akumin Texas pursuant to its CIA, or otherwise, will not be extended beyond its termination date. Any action
brought against us for violation of these laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us
to incur significant legal expenses, suffer reputational harm and divert our management’s attention from the
operation of our business.

**CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

In the normal course of business, the Company engages in transactions with its wholly owned and controlled
subsidiaries. Balances and transactions between the Company and its wholly owned and controlled subsidiaries have
been eliminated on consolidation in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

The Company transacts with key individuals from management who have the authority to plan, direct, and control
the activities of the Company, including through employment agreements and stock-based compensation plans. Key
management personnel are defined as the executive officers of the Company and the board of directors of the
Company (the “Board”), including the President and Chief Executive Officer, Executive Vice President and Chief
Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Secretary and Senior Vice Presidents.

There are no material interests, direct or indirect, of any of our directors or executive officers, any shareholder that
beneficially owns or controls or directs (directly or indirectly) more than 10% of any class or series of our
outstanding voting securities, or any associate or affiliate of any of the foregoing persons, in any transaction within
the three most recently completed financial years or during the current financial year that has materially affected or
is reasonably expected to materially affect us or any of our subsidiaries.

Through June 2020, Alliance had arrangements with an affiliate of the Seller to provide certain consulting services
and for the licensing of Alliance’s brand. During the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, Alliance recognized
revenues of $0.6 million and $1.5 million, respectively, in connection with these arrangements. As of December 31,
2019, the total amount due from the affiliate of the Seller was $1.9 million. During the year ended December 31,
2020, Alliance wrote off the outstanding balance of $2.4 million due from the affiliate of the Seller as it was deemed
uncollectible.

**DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN OTHER INDEBTEDNESS**

_The following description is a summary of the material provisions of our material indebtedness, excluding the Notes_
_offered hereby, as they exist on the date hereof and expected to be outstanding after the closing of this offering and_
_the application of the proceeds therefrom._

**_The Revolving Credit Agreement_**

On November 2, 2020, we entered into a new revolving credit agreement (the “Revolving Credit Agreement”) with
BBVA USA, as administrative and collateral agent (the “Agent”), which provides for a senior secured revolving
credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $55 million (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), with sublimits for
the issuance of letters of credit and for swingline loans. The Revolving Credit Facility matures on the date that is
five years after the issue date (the “Revolving Credit Facility Maturity Date”); provided that, if more than $50
million in aggregate principal amount of Notes is outstanding on the date that is 181 days prior to the Revolving
Credit Facility Maturity Date, then the Revolving Credit Facility Maturity Date shall instead be the date that is 181
days prior to the Revolving Credit Facility Maturity Date.

The availability of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility is subject to customary terms and conditions.

The Revolving Credit Facility contains negative covenants and events of default substantially similar to the negative
covenants and events of default in the indenture governing the Notes. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility
contains a “springing” financial maintenance covenant based on a first lien net leverage ratio. The financial covenant
will be tested on the last day of any fiscal quarter if the aggregate principal amount of loans outstanding under the
Revolving Credit Facility exceed a certain percentage of the total amount of commitments under the Revolving
Credit Facility on such day.

The Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by our wholly-owned restricted subsidiaries, including our Professional
Services Affiliates, that are organized under the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof, in
each case subject to certain exceptions. The Revolving Credit Facility is secured by (i) a first-priority lien on
substantially all of the tangible and intangible personal property of the Company and the guarantors and (ii) a pledge
of substantially all of the shares of stock, partnership interests and limited liability company interests of each
restricted subsidiary that are directly held by us or a guarantor.

The interest rates per annum applicable to loans under the Revolving Credit Facility are equal to, at our option,
either a LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin or a base rate plus an applicable margin. We are required to pay a
commitment fee on the undrawn portion available under the Revolving Credit Facility.

The information set forth above regarding our Revolving Credit Facility is a summary. It does not purport to be
complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the documents governing the Revolving Credit Facility,
including the definition of certain terms therein.

**_The 2025 Senior Notes_**

On November 2, 2020, we issued $400 million of aggregate principal amount of 7.00% Senior Secured Notes due
2025 (the “Initial 2025 Senior Notes”). The Initial 2025 Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as
of November 2, 2020, by and among Akumin Inc. and UMB Bank, National Association, as trustee and as notes
collateral agent (in such capacity, the “Trustee and Collateral Agent”).

On February 11, 2021, we completed a tack on offering of $75 million in aggregate principal amount to the Initial
2025 Senior Notes (the “Tack On Notes”). The Tack On Notes were issued pursuant to a supplemental indenture
under the indenture governing the Initial 2025 Senior Notes. The Tack On Notes and the Initial 2025 Senior Notes
(together, the “2025 Senior Notes”) are treated as a single class of debt securities under the indenture governing the
Initial 2025 Senior Notes (the “2025 Senior Notes Indenture”). The Tack On Notes have identical terms to the Initial
2025 Senior Notes, other than with respect to the issue date and issue price.

The 2025 Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior secured basis by
each of our wholly-owned restricted subsidiaries, including our professional service affiliates and the guarantors.

149


-----

The 2025 Senior Notes Indenture restricts our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries (including our
professional service affiliates) to, among other things:

  - incur certain additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock;

  - make certain distributions, investments and other restricted payments;

  - sell certain assets;

  - agree to any restrictions on the ability of restricted subsidiaries (including our professional service
affiliates) to make payments to us;

  - create certain liens;

  - merge, consolidate or sell substantially all of our assets; and

  - enter into certain transactions with affiliates.

The 2025 Senior Notes and the related guarantees are secured on a first-priority basis, equally and ratably pursuant,
with the indebtedness under our Revolving Credit Facility, by liens on substantially all of our and the guarantors’
tangible and intangible assets, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens (the “2025 Senior Notes Collateral”).

The 2025 Senior Notes and the guarantees are our and the guarantors’ senior secured obligations, and rank equally
in right of payment with all of our and the guarantors’ existing and future senior indebtedness, including
indebtedness under our Revolving Credit Facility and are effectively senior to (i) all of our and the guarantors’
existing and future unsecured indebtedness, and (ii) all of our and the guarantors’ existing and future indebtedness
secured by the 2025 Senior Notes Collateral on a junior basis, in each case, to the extent of the value of the 2025
Senior Notes Collateral securing the Notes and the related guarantees and are effectively subordinated, or otherwise
subordinated by operation of applicable law, to any of ours and the guarantors’ obligations that are secured by liens
on assets that have a priority, effectively or by operation of applicable law, to the liens securing the 2025 Senior
Notes, to the extent of the value of the assets or property securing such obligations.

We may redeem some or all of the 2025 Senior Notes at any time on or after November 1, 2022, at certain
redemption prices set forth in the 2025 Senior Notes Indenture, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
thereon to, but not including, the redemption date. Prior to November 1, 2022, we may also redeem some or all of
the 2025 Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus a make-whole premium,
together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but not including, the redemption date. We may also
redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Senior Notes, at any time prior to November 1,
2022, with an amount not to exceed the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at redemption price equal to
107% of the principal amount thereof on the repurchase date, together with accrued and unpaid interest to such
redemption date.

In the event of a specified change of control, each holder of 2025 Senior Notes may require us to repurchase its 2025
Senior Notes in whole or in part at a repurchase price of 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus
accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to (but not including) the repurchase date.

**_The Financing Notes_**

It is expected that, at the Closing, Akumin Corp. will issue $200,000,000 aggregate amount of Initial Financing
Notes. The Financing Notes will bear interest at 11.00% per annum, payable quarterly in cash; provided, however,
that, subject to certain conditions, Akumin Corp. will have the option, for a two-year period following the Closing,
to satisfy the payment of interest on any Financing Notes through a combination of cash and/or via PIK.

The Financing Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of Akumin Corp. and will not have the benefit of any
guarantees.

150


-----

The Financing Notes will contain certain covenants similar to the covenants in the Notes; provided, however, that
the Financing Notes will contain restrictions on our ability to, among other things, incur indebtedness in excess of a
total leverage ratio of 4.5:1.0. To the extent the aggregate principal amount of the Initial Financing Notes is less than
the maximum $689,570,000 principal amount of Financing Notes available for issuance at the Closing, such unused
portion will remain available to be drawn by Akumin Corp., subject to the limitations in the covenants pertaining to
the Notes, the 2025 Senior Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility, for a three-year period following the Closing,
provided certain conditions are met. Any such future issuance of Financing Notes will be on the same terms
described above and the proceeds of which will be used to finance future organic growth and acquisition
opportunities that are agreed by Stonepeak; provided, however, that the number of Financing Warrants that
accompany such issuance of Financing Notes will equal 20% of the dollar amount issued by Akumin Corp. divided
by 120% of the 10-day volume weighted average price of the Akumin Common Shares ending on the trading day
immediately prior to the earlier of the announcement or issuance of such Financing Warrants (the “Growth Equity
Warrant Strike Price”), and the exercise price for such additional Financing Warrants will be equal to the Growth
Equity Warrant Strike Price, subject to regulatory approval. The proceeds of any future issuance of Finance Notes
will be used to finance our organic growth as well as future merger and acquisition opportunities (unrelated to the
Acquisition) that are agreed to between Stonepeak and us.

Additionally, we have the right under the Financing Notes to elect to pay PIK interest for the first two years from the
issuance of such Financing Notes. If we elect to pay PIK interest, this will further increase our indebtedness and we
will pay PIK interest at a rate of 13% per annum, as opposed to 11% per annum for interest on the Financing Notes
that is not PIK. During an event of default or at a time when certain affirmative or negative covenants are not
complied with, the interest rate on the Financing Notes shall automatically be increased by 200 basis points per
annum. Furthermore, if we are subject to a change of control for purposes of the Financing Notes, we may
voluntarily repurchase or be required to repurchase the Financing Notes at the prices specified in such Financing
Notes up to a maximum of 125% if such change of control occurs prior to the first anniversary of the issuance of
such Financing Notes, decreasing 5% per year for the next three subsequent years and decreasing to 105% between
the sixth and seventh anniversaries of the issuance of such Financing Notes.

At any time after seven years from the issuance date of the Financing Notes, Akumin Corp. may redeem such
Financing Notes, in whole or in part, by paying in cash the principal amount and any accrued but unpaid interest, in
each case, plus 5%. To the extent that Akumin Corp. has not redeemed Financing Notes by the eleventh anniversary
of the issuance date of such Financing Notes, Akumin Corp. will be required to redeem: (a) 50% of such Financing
Notes including any PIK amount outstanding on the eleventh anniversary of such issuance date by paying in cash
the principal amount and any accrued but unpaid interest, in each case, plus 5%; and (b) the remaining balance
(including any PIK amount) by the twelfth anniversary of such issuance date by paying in cash the principal amount
and any accrued but unpaid interest, in each case, plus 5%.

See “The Transactions – Summary of the Financings.”

**_Equipment Debt_**

Approximately $63 million of Alliance’s and its subsidiaries’ equipment debt will be assumed by Akumin in
connection with the Acquisition. Alliance’s equipment debt is composed of financing arrangements with various
lenders. Certain of Alliance’s equipment debt obligations are subject to covenants with which it must comply on a
quarterly or annual basis. Alliance was in compliance with all such covenants as of March 31, 2021, except for one
covenant in an agreement between an equipment lender and one of the Company’s controlled joint ventures. The
equipment debt outstanding under this arrangement as of March 31, 2021 was $7.1 million. A waiver was obtained
from the equipment lender for the violation of the minimum debt service coverage ratio for the trailing 12-month
period as of March 31, 2021.

**_Wesley Chapel Loan_**

Our subsidiary, Rose Radiology Centers, Inc., is the borrower of a purchase money secured loan (the “Wesley
Chapel Loan”) with a face value of $2 million as of August 15, 2018, which was issued to finance the purchase of
equipment and related installation for a new clinic location around Tampa Bay, Florida. It has an annual interest rate
of 5%, matures on August 15, 2023, has monthly repayments of approximately $38 thousand and is secured only by

151


-----

liens on the equipment financed. As of March 31, 2021, the face value of the Wesley Chapel Loan was
approximately $1.0 million.

152

**DESCRIPTION OF NOTES**

In this description, the term “Issuer” refers to (a) prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, Akumin Escrow Inc.
and (b) from and after the consummation of the Acquisition, to Akumin Inc. We will issue the notes (as used in this
Description of Notes section only, the “Notes”) under an indenture to be entered into between the Issuer, the
Guarantors (as defined below and only to the extent the Acquisition has been consummated on the Issue Date) and
UMB Bank, National Association, as trustee (in such capacity, the “Trustee”) and as notes collateral agent (in such
capacity, the “Collateral Agent”). If this offering is consummated prior to the Acquisition, upon the consummation
of the Acquisition, the Escrow Issuer will liquidate into Akumin Inc. and, on the liquidation, Akumin Inc. will
assume the obligations of Escrow Issuer under the Indenture and the notes. The Guarantors will also guarantee the
Issuer’s obligations under the Indenture and the notes at such time. The Escrow Agreement, as defined and referred
to below under the caption “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,” defines the terms of the
escrow of the gross proceeds from this offering and other funds pending consummation of the Acquisition. The
following description is a summary of the material provisions of the indenture, the Escrow Agreement, the
Collateral Documents (as defined below) and the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below). It does not
restate the indenture, the Collateral Documents or the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement in their entirety and is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the indenture, the Escrow Agreement, the Collateral Documents and the First
Lien Intercreditor Agreement, including the definitions contained in the foregoing of certain terms used below. We
urge you to read the indenture, the Escrow Agreement, the Notes, the Collateral Documents and the First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement because they, and not this description, will define your rights as a holder of the Notes.
Copies of the proposed forms of the indenture, the Notes, the Collateral Documents and the First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement are available to you upon request.

You can find the definitions of some of the capitalized terms used in this section under the subheading “—Certain
definitions.” In this section of the offering memorandum:

- the terms “Issuer,” “we,” “us,” “our” or similar terms refer only to Akumin Inc. or Akumin Escrow Inc., as
applicable and not to any of our subsidiaries; and

- references to “Guarantors” shall mean our direct and indirect Restricted Subsidiaries (including our Professional
Services Affiliates) that guarantee the Notes.

The terms of the Notes include only those terms specifically stated in the indenture and the Notes. The indenture
will not be qualified under or subject to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

If this offering does close prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, pursuant to the terms of an escrow
agreement (the “Escrow Agreement”), to be dated as of the Issue Date, among the Issuer, the Trustee, and JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A., as escrow agent (the “Escrow Agent”), (i) the Issuer will deposit the gross proceeds of the
offering of the Notes into an escrow account with the Escrow Agent and (ii) the Issuer (or one or more of its
affiliates) will deposit into such escrow account with the Escrow Agent funds sufficient to pay interest with respect
to the Notes up to, but not including, the then applicable latest possible Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as
defined below) ((i) and (ii), collectively, the “Escrowed Funds”). The Escrow Agreement, including the conditions
to the release of the Escrowed Funds, is more fully described below under “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special
Mandatory Redemption.” In the event the Acquisition has not been consummated on or before October 25, 2021 (as
such date may be extended as set forth below, but no later than January 24, 2022, the “Outside Date”), or upon the
occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will be redeemed at a price equal to 100.0% of the initial issue price of
the notes, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest from the Issue Date to, but not including, the Special
Mandatory Redemption Date (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Price”). See “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special
Mandatory Redemption.”

**Holding Company Structure**

Akumin, Inc. is a holding company and does not have any material assets or operations other than ownership of the
Capital Stock of its subsidiaries and its relationships with its Professional Services Affiliates. All of its material
operations are conducted through its Subsidiaries. As a result, the Issuer depends on the cash flow of its Subsidiaries
to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Notes. Claims of creditors of such Subsidiaries that are
not Guarantors, including trade creditors, and claims of preferred stockholders, if any, of such Subsidiaries generally
will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of such Subsidiaries over the claims of the Issuer’s

153


-----

creditors, including holders of the Notes. The Notes, therefore, are structurally subordinated to creditors, including
trade creditors, and preferred stockholders, if any, of our Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors.

**Brief Description of the Notes and the Guarantees**

**_The Notes_**

Prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, the Notes will only be senior secured obligations of the Escrow Issuer
secured only by a first priority security interest in the Escrowed Funds and Akumin Inc. and its subsidiaries (other
than the Escrow Issuer) will have no obligations under the Notes. The Escrow Issuer will have no material assets
other than the Escrowed Funds. Accordingly, holders of the Notes will have no recourse for repayment against
Akumin Inc. or its subsidiaries (other than the Escrow Issuer). From and after the consummation of the Acquisition,
the Notes will:

- be senior secured obligations of the Issuer;

- rank equally in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s existing and future senior debt (including the Credit
Agreement Obligations, the 2025 Senior Notes Obligations and the 2025 Senior Notes);

- rank senior in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s future Subordinated Indebtedness, if any;

- be secured on a first-priority basis by Liens on the Collateral (subject to Permitted Liens and certain exceptions)
on an equal and ratable basis with all existing and future First Lien Obligations of the Issuer (including the Credit
Agreement Obligations and the 2025 Senior Notes Obligations);

- rank effectively senior to all existing and future unsecured debt, including the Initial Financing Notes and any
other Financing Notes issued after the Closing, and any future Junior Lien Obligations of the Issuer, to the extent
of the value of the Collateral;

- rank effectively junior to all existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is secured by Liens on assets that
do not constitute a part of the Collateral, to the extent of the value of such assets;

- be structurally subordinated to all debt and other liabilities (including trade payables) of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries
that are not Guarantors; and

- be fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Guarantors.

The Notes will be issued in fully registered form only, without coupons, in minimum denominations of $2,000 and
integral multiples of $1,000.

**_Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption_**

This offering may be consummated prior to the consummation of the Acquisition. If this offering does close prior to
the consummation of the Acquisition, concurrently with the closing of the offering of the Notes on the Issue Date,
the Issuer will enter into the Escrow Agreement with the Trustee and the Escrow Agent, pursuant to which the Issuer
(or one or more of its affiliates) will deposit the Escrowed Funds into an escrow account with the Escrow Agent.
The Issuer will grant the Trustee, for the benefit of itself, the Escrow Agent and the holders of the Notes, a firstpriority security interest in the Escrow Account and all deposits and investments therein to secure the Obligations
under the Notes pending disbursement as described below by its acceptance of the Notes, each Holder shall be
deemed to authorize and direct the Trustee to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Escrow
Agreement.

The Issuer will only be entitled to direct the Escrow Agent to release the Escrowed Funds in accordance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreement. Pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent will release the Escrowed
Funds to the Issuer upon satisfaction of certain conditions, including the presentation by the Escrow Issuer of an
Officer’s Certificate addressed to the Escrow Agent on or prior to the Outside Date, certifying that the following
conditions have been met (the “Escrow Release Conditions”):

###### (1) all conditions precedent to the consummation of the Acquisition set forth in the Acquisition Agreement
(as in effect on the Issue Date) have been satisfied or, subject to clause (2) below, waived;

154


-----

###### (2) (a) the Acquisition will be consummated substantially simultaneously with the release of the Escrowed
Funds, in all material respects in accordance with the terms of the Acquisition Agreement (as in effect
on the Issue Date) and (b) no provision of the Acquisition Agreement (as in effect on the Issue Date)
shall have been amended, waived or modified or consent granted in a manner materially adverse to the
holders of the Notes, as determined in good faith by the Issuer, without the consent of the holders of a
majority in principal amount of the Notes outstanding;

###### (3) (i) Akumin Inc. and the Guarantors shall become party to the Purchase Agreement by means of a
joinder to the Purchase Agreement, (ii) Akumin Inc. shall have assumed, or contemporaneously with
the consummation of the Acquisition shall assume, by supplemental indenture or joinder, as applicable,
all of the obligations of the Escrow Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture and the Escrow Issuer
shall be liquidated; (iii) each of Guarantors shall have, by supplemental indenture or joinder, effective
upon the consummation of the Acquisition, become, or substantially simultaneously with the
consummation of the Acquisition shall become, guarantors of the Notes and parties to the Indenture
and (iv) Akumin Inc. and the Guarantors will enter into the Collateral Documents (and to the extent
applicable will provide perfected security interests in the Collateral at such time) and a joinder to the
First Lien Intercreditor Agreement;

###### (4) all Escrowed Property will be applied in the manner described under the caption “Use of Proceeds” in
this Offering Memorandum;

###### (5) Akumin Inc. shall have issued at least 3,500,000 shares of common stock to Stonepeak in accordance
with the Series A Notes and Common Share Purchase Agreement (as in effect on the Issue Date); and

###### (6) Akumin Corp. shall have issued at least $200,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Initial Financing
Notes to Stonepeak in accordance with the Series A Notes and Common Share Purchase Agreement (as
in effect on the Issue Date).

In the event that (1) the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the Outside Date, (2) at any time prior to the
Outside Date, the Escrow Release Conditions are deemed by the Issuer to be incapable of being satisfied on or prior
to the Outside Date or (3) at any time prior to the Outside Date, the Acquisition Agreement is terminated (any such
event being a “Mandatory Redemption Event”), the Issuer will redeem all of the Notes (the “Special Mandatory
_Redemption”) at the Special Mandatory Redemption Price, plus accrued but unpaid interest to, but not including, the_
Special Mandatory Redemption Date fixed for such redemption. Notice of the occurrence of a Mandatory
Redemption Event will be mailed by the Issuer (a “Special Redemption Notice”) within three (3) Business Days
following the occurrence of a Mandatory Redemption Event, to the Trustee and the Escrow Agent. The Special
Redemption Notice will specify the date fixed for such Special Mandatory Redemption (the “Special Mandatory
_Redemption Date”), which date may not be any later than three (3) Business Days from the date of such Special_
Redemption Notice. Concurrently with the delivery of the Special Redemption Notice, the Issuer will instruct the
Trustee to, at the Issuer’s expense, mail (by first-class mail to each holder’s registered address or otherwise in
accordance with the procedures of DTC) the Special Redemption Notice which will state that a Special Mandatory
Redemption will occur on the Outside Date or the date specified in the Special Redemption Notice. Within three
Business Days after the Trustee’s mailing of such notice of a Mandatory Redemption Event, the Issuer will
consummate the Special Mandatory Redemption. Upon the consummation of the Acquisition, the foregoing
provisions regarding the Special Mandatory Redemption will cease to apply.

The Outside Date shall initially be October 25, 2021; provided that the Issuer may, upon one Business Days’ notice
(the “Extension Notice”) to the Trustee and the Escrow Agent on one or more occasions extend the Outside Date
(the “Extension”) to the extended Outside Date specified in such Extension Notice, so long as the following terms
are satisfied:

(1) the Issuer (or one or more of its affiliates) shall have deposited into the Escrow Account funds sufficient to
pay interest with respect to the notes up to, but not including, the new latest possible Special Mandatory
Redemption Date; and

155


-----

(2) the Outside Date shall not be extended later than January 24, 2022.

All Escrowed Funds on deposit with the Escrow Agent will be invested by the Escrow Agent at the Issuer’s
instruction in Treasury Securities and other Escrow Investments.

“Treasury Securities” means any investment in obligations issued or guaranteed by the United States government or
any agency thereof, in each case, maturing no later than the Outside Date.

“Escrow Investments” means any of the following securities:

(1) Treasury Securities;

(2) investments in time deposit accounts, certificates of deposit and money market deposits, in each case
maturing no later than the Outside Date, entitled to U.S. Federal deposit insurance for the full amount
thereof or issued by a bank or trust company (including the Escrow Agent or an affiliate of the Escrow
Agent) that is organized under the laws of the United States of America or any state thereof having capital,
surplus and undivided profits aggregating in excess of $500.0 million;

(3) investments in commercial paper maturing no later than the Outside Date and having, at the date of
acquisition, a credit rating no lower than A-1 from S&P, P-1 from Moody’s, or F-1 from Fitch;

(4) repurchase obligations maturing no later than the Outside Date entered into with a nationally recognized
broker-dealer, with respect to which the purchased securities are obligations issued or guaranteed by the
United States government or any agency thereof, which repurchase obligations shall be entered into
pursuant to written agreements; and

(5) money market mutual funds that invest in items (1) through (4) above and are registered with the SEC
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and operated in accordance with Rule 2a-7 and
that at the time of such investment are rated Aaa by Moody’s and/or AAA by S&P, including such funds
for which the Trustee or an affiliate provides investment advice or other services.

If the Escrow Agent receives a Special Redemption Notice, the Escrow Agent will liquidate all Escrowed Funds
then held by it not later than the last Business Day prior to the Special Mandatory Redemption Date. On the
Business Day prior to the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, the Escrow Agent will deliver sufficient funds to the
Trustee for payment of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price to the holders of Notes. After payment of the
Special Mandatory Redemption Price to the holders of the Notes, any excess Escrowed Funds will be returned to the
Issuer.

No provisions of the Escrow Agreement (including, without limitation, those relating to the release of the Escrowed
Funds) may be waived or modified in any manner materially adverse to the holders of the Notes (as determined in
good faith by the Issuer) without the written consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes
outstanding. To the extent such provisions relate to the Issuer’s obligation to redeem the Notes in a Special
Mandatory Redemption, no provisions of the Indenture, may be waived or modified in any manner materially
adverse to the holders of the Notes without the written consent of all of such holders.

If we are able to consummate the Acquisition on the same day that we close this offering, then we may elect to
forego the escrow procedures described above in their entirety, in which case there would be no Escrow Agreement,
escrow account or Special Mandatory Redemption provisions. To secure the Obligations with respect to the Notes,
the Escrow Issuer will grant the trustee, for the benefit of the holders of the notes, a first priority security interest in
the Escrow Account and all deposits therein, pending disbursement as described above, and the Escrow Agreement
will require that such security interest be perfected upon or prior to the closing of this offering.

Except as the context otherwise requires, the provisions described elsewhere in this “Description of Notes” refer to
the provisions of the Indenture as will be in effect following the consummation of the Acquisition and the
satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions (such date, the “Escrow Release Date”).

156


-----

**_Activities Prior to Escrow Release_**

Prior to the consummation of the Acquisition and the satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions, the Escrow
Issuer will comprise a limited purpose corporation whose primary activities are restricted to issuing the Notes,
issuing capital stock to, and receiving capital contributions from, Akumin, Inc., performing its obligations in respect
of the Notes under the indenture and the Escrow Agreement, and consummating the Escrow Release Conditions or
redeeming the Notes as set forth above under the caption “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,”
as applicable, and conducting such other activities as are necessary or appropriate to carry out the activities
described above. Prior to the consummation of the Acquisition and the satisfaction of the Escrow Release
Conditions, the Escrow Issuer will not engage in any business activity or enter into any transaction or agreement
(including, without limitation, making any restricted payment, incurring any debt, incurring any Liens except in
favor of the holders of the Notes, entering into any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of its
assets or engaging in any transaction with its Affiliates) except in the ordinary course of business or necessary to
effectuate the Transactions substantially in accordance with the description of the Transactions set forth in the
Offering Memorandum, together with such amendments, modifications and waivers that are not, individually or in
the aggregate, materially adverse to Akumin, Inc. and its Subsidiaries (after giving effect to the consummation of the
Transactions), taken as a whole, or to the holders of the notes, as determined by Akumin in good faith.

Prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, Akumin Inc. and its subsidiaries (other than the Escrow Issuer) will
not be parties to the indenture and will not be controlled by the Escrow Issuer. Accordingly, prior to the
consummation of the Acquisition, Akumin Inc. and its subsidiaries (other than the Escrow Issuer) will not be subject
to the restrictions, agreements and covenants of the indenture.

**_The Guarantees_**

Following the consummation of the Acquisition, the Notes will be guaranteed by the Guarantors, which includes
substantially all of our direct and indirect Wholly-Owned Restricted Subsidiaries (including our Professional
Services Affiliates and Wholly-Owned Restricted Subsidiaries acquired in the Acquisition), in each case, that are
organized under the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof. In addition, following the Issue
Date, any Restricted Subsidiary (including our Professional Services Affiliates) of the Issuer that becomes a
guarantor under certain Indebtedness must also guarantee the Notes.

Not all of our Subsidiaries guarantee the Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of
these non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, these non-Guarantor Subsidiaries will be obligated to pay the holders of their
indebtedness and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to us. For the twelvemonth period ended March 31, 2021, after giving effect to the Transactions, our non-Guarantor Subsidiaries
represented approximately 21% of our total revenue. As of March 31, 2021, after giving effect to the Transactions,
our non-Guarantor Subsidiaries held approximately 7% of our total assets and approximately 3% of our total
liabilities.

The Guarantee provided by each Guarantor:

- is a senior secured obligation of such Guarantor;

- ranks equally in right of payment with all existing and future senior debt of such Guarantor (including the Credit
Agreement Obligations and the 2025 Senior Notes Obligations);

- ranks senior in right of payment to all future Subordinated Indebtedness of such Guarantor, if any;

- is secured on a first-priority basis by Liens on the Collateral (subject to Permitted Liens and certain exceptions)
on an equal and ratable basis with all existing and future obligations of such Guarantor under any other First Lien
Obligations (including the Credit Agreement Obligations and the 2025 Senior Notes Obligations);

- ranks effectively senior to all existing and future unsecured obligations, including the Initial Financing Notes and
any other Financing Notes issued after the Closing, and obligations of such Guarantor under any Junior Lien
Obligations, to the extent of the value of the Collateral;

- ranks effectively junior to all existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is secured by Liens on
assets that do not constitute a part of the Collateral, to the extent of the value of such assets; and

157


-----

- is structurally subordinated to all debt and other liabilities (including trade payables) of any Subsidiaries (if any)
of such Guarantor that are not Guarantors.

Under certain circumstances, we will be permitted to designate certain of our Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted
Subsidiaries.” Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the restrictive covenants in the indenture. Unrestricted
Subsidiaries will not guarantee the Notes.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Notes will be issued in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million. Additional Notes (“Additional Notes”)
may be issued under the indenture from time to time in an unlimited amount, subject to compliance with the
covenants contained in the indenture. Any additional Notes will be part of the same series as the Notes offered
hereby and will vote on all matters as a single series with the Notes offered in this offering; provided, however, that
no additional notes will be issued with the same CUSIP or ISIN as the Notes unless the Issuer intends to treat such
additional notes and the Notes as fungible for U.S. and Canadian federal income tax purposes. All references to the
Notes include additional Notes.

The Notes will mature on        , 2028.

Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate per annum set forth on the cover page of this offering memorandum, and
will be payable semiannually in cash on each        and        , commencing     , 2022, to holders of
record on the immediately preceding       and       , respectively. Interest on the Notes will accrue from the
most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from the date of issuance. Interest on
the Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year composed of twelve 30-day months.

Solely for the purposes of disclosure pursuant to the Interest Act (Canada), whenever any interest is calculated using
a rate based on a year of 360 days or the number of days in accordance with market practice, as the case may be,
such rate determined pursuant to such calculation, when expressed as an annual rate, is equivalent to (i) the
applicable rate based on a year of 360 days or the number of days in accordance with market practice, as the case
may be, multiplied by (ii) the actual number of days in the calendar year in which the period for such interest is
payable (or compounded) ends, divided by (iii) 360 or the number of days in accordance with market practice, as the
case may be. The principle of deemed reinvestment of interest shall not apply to any interest calculation under the
Indenture; all interest payments to be made under the Indenture shall be paid without allowance or deduction for
deemed reinvestment or otherwise, before and after demand, default and judgment. The rates of interest specified in
the Indenture are intended to be nominal rates and not effective rates, and any interest calculated thereunder shall be
calculated using the nominal rate method and not the effective rate method of calculation.

The Notes will be payable both as to principal and interest at our office or agency maintained for such purpose or, at
our option, payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the holders of the Notes at their respective
addresses set forth in the register of holders of Notes. Until otherwise designated by us, our office or agency
maintained for such purpose will be the office of the Trustee.

**Guarantees**

From and after the consummation of the Acquisition, each Guarantor will, jointly and severally with each other
Guarantor, guarantee the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes. The obligations of each Guarantor under its
Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent such Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or
fraudulent transfer under applicable law. This provision may not, however, be effective to protect a Guarantee from
being voided under fraudulent transfer or conveyance law, or may reduce the applicable Guarantor’s obligation to an
amount that effectively makes its Guarantee worthless. In addition to potentially being voidable, a Guarantee could
also be subordinated by a court to all other Indebtedness (including Guarantees and other contingent liabilities) of
the Guarantor, and, depending on the amount of such Indebtedness, a Guarantor’s liability on its Guarantee could be
reduced to zero. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—A subsidiary guarantee could be voided if it
constitutes a fraudulent transfer under U.S. bankruptcy or similar state law or foreign law, which would prevent the
holders of the notes from relying on that subsidiary to satisfy claims.”

Each Guarantor that makes a payment or distribution under a Guarantee will be entitled upon payment in full of all
guaranteed obligations under the Indenture to a contribution from each other Guarantor in an amount equal to such
other Guarantor’s pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net worth of all the Guarantors at the
time of such payment determined in accordance with GAAP.

158


-----

Each Guarantor may consolidate or amalgamate with or merge into or sell its assets to us or another Restricted
Subsidiary, or with or to other Persons in a transaction that complies with the covenants described under “—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales” or “—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets,” as
applicable.

The Guarantee of a Guarantor will be deemed automatically discharged and released upon:

(1) in connection with any direct or indirect sale, conveyance or other disposition of all the capital stock of such
Guarantor (including any such sale, conveyance or other disposition after which such Guarantor is no longer a
Restricted Subsidiary and excluding any sale, conveyance or other disposition of the Capital Stock of a
Professional Services Affiliate to another Person if such Professional Services Affiliate remains a Restricted
Subsidiary) or of all or substantially all of the assets and property of such Guarantor, if such sale or disposition
is made in compliance with the applicable provisions of the indenture (see “—Certain Covenants—Limitation
on Asset Sales”);

(2) if such Guarantor is liquidated in accordance with the provisions of the indenture;

(3) if we designate any such Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in compliance with the terms of the
indenture;

(4) with respect to any Guarantor that initially provided its guarantee of the Notes pursuant to the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Subsidiary Guarantees” (which, for the avoidance of
doubt, does not include any Guarantor as of the Issue Date), upon the release or discharge (other than a release
or discharge by or as a result of payment under such guarantee or payment in full of such Indebtedness) of the
guarantee by such Guarantor of the Indebtedness that resulted in the requirement for such Guarantor to
provide its guarantee of the Notes;

(5) upon a discharge of the indenture in accordance with “—Satisfaction and Discharge” or upon any Legal
Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance of the indenture.

For the avoidance of doubt, no Guarantee of a Guarantor shall be released as a result of the issuance or sale of
Preferred Equity Interests in a Restricted Subsidiary to a Strategic Partner.

**Security**

**_General_**

Following the consummation of the Acquisition, the Notes and Guarantees will be, secured by first priority Liens on
the Collateral, in each case subject to certain exceptions, Permitted Liens and encumbrances described in the
indenture and the Collateral Documents. The Notes and the Guarantees will share in the benefit of such Liens on the
Collateral on a pari passu basis with the other First Lien Obligations, including the Credit Agreement Obligations
and the 2025 Senior Notes Obligations.

The Liens on the Collateral that will secure the Notes and the Guarantees will be granted under the Collateral
Documents in favor of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Notes Secured Parties. By its acceptance of a Note,
each holder of the Notes authorizes the Collateral Agent and the Trustee, if applicable, to execute, deliver and
perform its obligations under the Collateral Documents, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and, if applicable,
any Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement, binding the holders to the terms thereof.

The Collateral will consist of all of the property and assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors that also secure the
Credit Agreement Obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors pursuant to the Credit Agreement Documents and the
2025 Senior Notes Obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors pursuant to the 2025 Senior Notes Documents (and,
for the avoidance of doubt, subject to equivalent limitations and qualifications applying to the security securing the
Credit Agreement Obligations and the 2025 Senior Notes Obligations). In addition, the indenture and the Collateral
Documents will exclude certain property from the Collateral (the “Excluded Property”), including:

(1) vehicles or other assets covered by a certificate of title or ownership,

(2) any interest in real property (whether fee or leasehold or otherwise),

(3) commercial tort claims with a value of less than $5.0 million (with such value determined by the Issuer in
good faith),

159


-----

(4) those assets as to which the Issuer and the Credit Agreement Administrative Agent shall reasonably determine
in writing that the costs of obtaining such security interest are excessive in relation to the value of the security
to be afforded thereby; provided that the Collateral Agent shall have received written notice of such
determination and if such assets have a fair market value (as determined by the Issuer) in excess of
$7.5 million, such assets do not secure (or purport to secure) any other First Lien Obligations or any Junior
Lien Obligations,

(5) assets if the granting or perfecting of a security interest in such assets in favor of the Collateral Agent would
violate any applicable law (other than to the extent that any such term would be rendered ineffective pursuant
to Section 9-406, 9-407, 9-408 or 9-409 of the Uniform Commercial Code of any applicable jurisdiction or
other similar applicable law in any jurisdiction) or principles of equity,

(6) any right, title or interest in any instrument, permit, lease, intangible, general intangible (other than Equity
Interests), license, contract or agreement to the extent, but only to the extent that a grant of a security interest
therein to secure the Notes Obligations would, under the terms of such instrument, permit, lease, intangible,
general intangible (other than Equity Interests), license, contract or agreement, result in a breach of the terms
of, or constitute a default under, or result in the abandonment, termination, invalidation or unenforceability of,
or require the consent of any person other than the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries, which has not been
obtained under such instrument, permit, lease, intangible, general intangible, license, contract or agreement
(other than to the extent that any such term would be rendered ineffective pursuant to Section 9-406, 9-407, 9408 or 9-409 of the Uniform Commercial Code of any applicable jurisdiction or any other applicable law
(including, without limitation, Title 11 of the United States Code and the PPSA) or other similar applicable
law in any jurisdiction or principles of equity),

(7) any Capital Stock acquired after the Issue Date (other than Capital Stock in a Subsidiary (including
Professional Services Affiliates) issued or acquired after such Person became a Subsidiary) in accordance with
the indenture if, and to the extent that, and for so long as, in the case of this clause (7), (i) such Capital Stock
constitutes less than 50% of all applicable Capital Stock of such Person, and the Person or Persons holding the
remainder of such Capital Stock are not Affiliates of the Issuer to the extent and for so long as a grant of a
security interest therein to secure the Notes Obligations would be prohibited by the organizational documents
of such Person, (ii) the granting or perfecting of a security interest in such assets in favor of the Collateral
Agent would violate applicable law or a contractual obligation binding on such Capital Stock and (iii) with
respect to such contractual obligations (other than contractual obligations in connection with limited liability
company agreements, stockholders’ agreements and other joint venture agreements), such obligation existed at
the time of the acquisition of such Capital Stock and was not created or made binding on such Capital Stock in
contemplation of or in connection with the acquisition of such Person,

(8) any Property purchased with the proceeds of Purchase Money Indebtedness incurred pursuant to clause (6)
under the heading “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness” if the contract or other
agreement in which the Indebtedness and/or Liens related thereto is granted (or the documentation providing
for such Capital Lease Obligation) prohibits or requires the consent of any Person other than the Issuer or any
of its Subsidiaries as a condition to the creation of any other security interest on such Property,

(9) any Capital Stock of Unrestricted Subsidiaries,

(10) any Capital Stock of Receivables Subsidiaries,

(11) any assets of any Subsidiary that is not a U.S. Subsidiary or a Canadian Subsidiary or any property that is
located outside of the United States or Canada,

(12) certain accounts that are excluded pursuant to the Credit Agreement,

(13) any intent-to use Trademark applications prior to the filing of a “Statement of Use”, “Amendment to Allege
Use” or similar filing with regard thereto, to the extent and solely during the period, in which the grant of a
security interest therein may impair the validity or enforceability of any Trademark that may issue from such
intent to use Trademark application under applicable law, and

(14) “margin stock” (within the meaning of Regulation U issued by the FRB);

provided, however, that Excluded Property shall not include (x) any Capital Stock of any Professional Services
Affiliate and any agreements described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the definition of “PC Entity Requirements” or (y)

160


-----

any proceeds, substitutions or replacements of any Excluded Property referred to in clauses (1) through (14) (unless
such proceeds, substitutions or replacements would constitute Excluded Property referred to in clauses (1) through
(14)).

In addition, control agreements shall not be required with respect to deposit accounts, securities accounts, or
uncertificated securities.

**_Certain Limitations on the Collateral_**

No appraisals of any of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor in
connection with the issuance and sale of the Notes. The value of the Collateral in the event of liquidation will
depend on many factors, including, among other things, the condition of the Collateral, the ability to sell the
Collateral in an orderly sale, the condition of the international, national and local economies, the availability of
buyers and similar factors. By its nature, some of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily
ascertainable market value or market. Consequently, liquidating the Collateral may not produce proceeds in an
amount sufficient to pay any amounts due on the Notes. We are also permitted to sell assets that constitute Collateral
and may not be required to offer to purchase the Notes.

In addition, the Collateral securing the Notes Obligations is shared with other creditors, subject to all other Permitted
Liens and the security interests in the Collateral securing the Notes will be pari passu in priority with any and all
security interests at any time granted to secure the Credit Agreement Obligations, the 2025 Senior Notes Obligations
and other First Lien Obligations. If there is a default, the value of the Collateral may not be sufficient to repay the
creditors of First Lien Obligations, including the holders of the Notes. In the event of a foreclosure, enforcement,
Insolvency Proceeding, or similar proceeding, we cannot assure you that the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of
the Collateral will be sufficient to pay Notes Obligations and the other First Lien Obligations. Any claim for the
difference between the amount, if any, realized by holders of the Notes from the sale of Collateral securing the
Notes Obligations will rank equally in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other unsecured
or undersecured senior Indebtedness and other unsubordinated Obligations, including trade payables. To the extent
that third parties establish Liens on the Collateral, such third parties could have rights and remedies with respect to
the assets that, if exercised, could adversely affect the value of the Collateral or the ability of the Collateral Agent or
the holders of the Notes to realize or foreclose on the Collateral. The Issuer may also issue additional Notes after the
Issue Date as described herein or otherwise incur First Lien Obligations that would be secured by Liens on the
Collateral, the effect of which would be to increase the amount of Indebtedness secured equally and ratably by Liens
on the Collateral. As described below, the ability of the holders of the Notes to realize on the Collateral would also
be subject to certain Bankruptcy Law limitations in the event of an Insolvency Proceeding. See “Risk Factors—
Risks Related to the Notes—Rights of holders of the notes in the Collateral may be adversely affected by
bankruptcy proceedings.”

**_Certain Bankruptcy and Insolvency Limitations_**

The right of the Collateral Agent to foreclose upon, enforce against, repossess, and dispose of the Collateral upon
the occurrence of an Event of Default would be significantly impaired (and at a minimum delayed) by applicable
Bankruptcy Law in the event that an Insolvency Proceeding were to be commenced by or against the Issuer or any
Guarantor prior to the Collateral Agent’s having foreclosed upon, repossessed, disposed of or otherwise enforced
against the Collateral. Upon the commencement of an Insolvency Proceeding, a secured creditor such as the
Collateral Agent is prohibited from foreclosing upon, enforcing or repossessing its security from a debtor, or from
disposing of previously repossessed security, in each case, without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not
be given under the facts in any particular circumstances).

In view of the broad equitable powers of a U.S. or Canadian bankruptcy court as well as the lack of a precise
definition of the term “adequate protection”, it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under the Notes
could be made following the commencement of an Insolvency Proceeding or the length of the delay in making any
such payments, whether or when the Collateral Agent could repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value of the
Collateral at any time during an Insolvency Proceeding or whether or to what extent holders of the Notes would be
compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral (through adequate protection or otherwise).

Furthermore, in the event a bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral is not sufficient to repay all
amounts due on the Notes and all other obligations secured on a pari passu or senior basis with respect to all or any
such Collateral, the holders of the Notes would hold secured claims only to the extent of the value of the Collateral
to which the holders of the Notes are entitled, and unsecured claims with respect to such shortfall. The Applicable

161


-----

Bankruptcy Law permits the payment and/or accrual of post-petition interest, fees and expenses to a secured creditor
during a debtor’s Insolvency Proceeding only to the extent the value of such creditor’s interest in the collateral is
determined by the bankruptcy court to exceed the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the obligations secured
by the collateral. See “Risk Factors—Risk Related to the Notes—The value of the Collateral may not be sufficient to
secure postpetition interest, fees, and expenses in an Insolvency Proceeding of us or any of the guarantors. In the
event of an Insolvency Proceeding of us or any of the guarantors, the holders of the notes would be deemed to have
an unsecured claim to the extent that our obligations in respect of the notes and all of our other obligations secured
by the Collateral equal or exceed the fair market value of the Collateral.”

**_Release of Liens_**

The Collateral Documents and the indenture will provide that the Liens on the Collateral owned by any Guarantor
will be automatically released when such Guarantor’s Guarantee is released in accordance with the terms of the
indenture. In addition, the Liens securing the Notes and the Guarantees will be released automatically:

(1) in whole, upon payment in full of all principal, interest and other Obligations on the Notes issued under the
Indenture or satisfaction and discharge or defeasance thereof, as provided under the heading “—Legal
Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

(2) in whole or in part, with the consent of the requisite holders of Notes in accordance with the provisions under
the heading “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver”;

(3) in part, as to any Property constituting Collateral that is disposed of to a Person other than the Issuer or a
Guarantor (other than dispositions of the equity interests of Professional Services Affiliates or of property or
assets of Professional Services Affiliates to other Professional Services Affiliates or owners of the equity
interest of Professional Services Affiliates) in a transaction permitted pursuant to the provisions under the
heading “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales” and not prohibited by the indenture, the Collateral
Documents or the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement;

(4) with respect to any Collateral that becomes “Excluded Property”, upon such Collateral becoming Excluded
Property pursuant to a transaction or circumstance not prohibited by the terms of the indenture;

(5) with respect to Collateral that is Capital Stock, upon the dissolution or liquidation of the issuer of such Capital
Stock in a transaction that is not prohibited by the terms of the indenture; and

(6) as described below in accordance with the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement;

The Collateral Agent will, without recourse, representation or warranty, execute documents reasonably requested by
the Issuer or the Guarantors to evidence the release of the Collateral as set forth above in accordance with the
provisions of the indenture, at the expense of the Issuer and the Guarantors, upon receipt of an officers’ certificate of
the Issuer certifying and an opinion of counsel stating that such release of Collateral is in accordance with the terms
of the indenture and that all conditions precedent relating to the release of Collateral have been satisfied.

For the avoidance of doubt, no Liens on Collateral shall be released as a result of the issuance or sale of Preferred
Equity Interests in a Restricted Subsidiary to a Strategic Partner.

**_After-Acquired Collateral_**

From and after the consummation of the Acquisition, if the Issuer or any Guarantor creates any additional security
interest upon any Property that would constitute Collateral to secure any First Lien Obligations, the Issuer and each
of the Guarantors must grant a first-priority perfected security interest (subject to Permitted Liens) upon any such
Collateral, as security for the Notes Obligations. The foregoing will be subject to certain exceptions consistent with
the exceptions set out in the Collateral Documents as in effect on the Issue Date. These exceptions will provide,
among other things, certain grace periods for perfection of Collateral and that certain Liens need not be created or
perfected where the costs outweigh the benefits of such grant.

**_Further Assurances_**

The Collateral Documents and the indenture will provide that the Issuer and the Guarantors shall, at their expense,
duly execute and deliver, or cause to be duly executed and delivered, such further agreements, documents,
instruments, financing and continuation statements (or equivalent statements) and amendments thereto and do or
cause to be done such further acts as may be necessary or proper or reasonably requested by the Collateral Agent to
evidence, perfect, maintain and enforce the security interests and the priority thereof in the Collateral in favor of the

162


-----

Collateral Agent for its benefit and for the benefit of the holders of the Notes and the Trustee, and to otherwise
effectuate the provisions or purposes of the indenture and the Collateral Documents.

**_First Lien Intercreditor Agreement_**

On November 20, 2020, the Issuer, the Guarantors, the trustee for the 2025 Senior Notes, the collateral agent for the
2025 Senior Notes, the Credit Agreement Administrative Agent and the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent entered
into an Intercreditor Agreement (as may be amended from time to time, the “First Lien Intercreditor Agreement”),
with respect to the Collateral, which may be amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise
modified from time to time without the consent of the holders of the Notes to add other parties holding First Lien
Obligations permitted to be incurred under the indenture and the Credit Agreement (subject to the satisfaction of
certain conditions set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement). The Collateral Agent and the Trustee will join
the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement on the Issue Date or upon the Escrow Release Date, as applicable. The First
Lien Intercreditor Agreement provides, among other things, (1) that Liens on the Collateral securing the Notes
Obligations, the Credit Agreement Obligations, the 2025 Senior Notes Obligations and any other First Lien
Obligations will be pari passu and that, except as provided below, all distributions in respect of the Collateral will be
shared ratably among the Notes Secured Parties, the Credit Agreement Secured Parties, the 2025 Senior Notes
Secured Parties and any Future First Lien Secured Parties, and (2) for certain procedures for exercising rights and
remedies in respect of the Liens on the Collateral.

Pursuant to the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, the Applicable Collateral Agent (acting on the
instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative) has the right to direct foreclosures, enforcements and take
other actions with respect to the Collateral, and the Collateral Agent (unless the Collateral Agent is then acting as
the Applicable Collateral Agent) and the other Authorized Representatives of other Series of First Lien Obligations
have no right to take actions with respect to the Collateral. The Applicable Authorized Representative is currently
the Credit Agreement Administrative Agent, as Authorized Representative in respect of the Credit Agreement
Obligations, and neither the Trustee nor the Collateral Agent will have any right to take any action with respect to
the Collateral under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement as of the date hereof. The Credit Agreement
Administrative Agent will remain the Applicable Authorized Representative until the earlier of (1) the Discharge of
Credit Agreement Obligations (without replacement of the Credit Agreement Obligations) and (2) the NonControlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date (such date, the “Applicable Authorized Agent Change
Date”). After the Applicable Authorized Agent Change Date, the Applicable Authorized Representative will be the
Authorized Representative of the Series of First Lien Obligations (other than the Credit Agreement Obligations) that
constitutes the largest outstanding principal amount of any then outstanding Series of First Lien Obligations (other
than the Credit Agreement Obligations) (the “Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative”).

The “Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date” is the date that is 120 days (throughout which
120-day period the Applicable Authorized Representative was the Major Non-Controlling Authorized
Representative) after the occurrence of both (a) an event of default, as defined in the indenture or other governing
agreement for that Series of First Lien Obligations, and (b) the Trustee’s and each other Authorized Representative’s
receipt of written notice from that Authorized Representative certifying that (i) such Authorized Representative is
the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative and that an event of default, as defined in the indenture or
other governing agreement for that Series of First Lien Obligations, has occurred and is continuing and (ii) the First
Lien Obligations of that Series are currently due and payable in full (whether as a result of acceleration thereof or
otherwise) in accordance with the indenture or other governing agreement for that Series of First Lien Obligations;
provided that the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date shall be stayed and shall not occur
and shall be deemed not to have occurred with respect to any Collateral (1) at any time the Credit Agreement
Administrative Agent or the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent has commenced and is diligently pursuing any
enforcement action with respect to such Collateral or (2) at any time the Issuer or any Guarantor that has granted a
security interest in such Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any Insolvency
Proceeding.

With respect to any Collateral, (i) the Applicable Collateral Agent shall act only on the instructions of the
Applicable Authorized Representative, (ii) the Applicable Collateral Agent shall not follow any instructions with
respect to such Collateral from any Non-Controlling Authorized Representative (or any other First Lien Secured
Party other than the Applicable Authorized Representative) and (iii) no Non-Controlling Authorized Representative
or other First Lien Secured Party (other than the Applicable Authorized Representative) shall or shall instruct the
Applicable Collateral Agent to, commence any judicial or nonjudicial enforcement or foreclosure proceedings with

163


-----

respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, interim receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or over,
attempt any action to take possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise take any
action to enforce its security interest in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of, any
Collateral. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) in any Insolvency Proceeding, the Collateral Agent or any other First
Lien Secured Party may file a proof of claim or statement of interest with respect to the First Lien Obligations owed
to such First Lien Secured Party; (ii) the Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party may take any action
to preserve or protect the validity and enforceability of the Liens granted in favor of such First Lien Secured Parties,
provided that no such action is, or could reasonably be expected to be, (A) adverse, in any material respect, to the
Liens granted in favor of the Controlling Secured Parties or the rights of the Applicable Collateral Agent or any
other Controlling Secured Parties to exercise remedies in respect thereof or (B) otherwise inconsistent with the terms
of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement; and (iii) the Collateral Agent or any First Lien Secured Party may file any
responsive or defensive pleadings in opposition to any motion, claim, adversary proceeding or other pleading made
by any person objecting to or otherwise seeking the disallowance of the claims or Liens of such First Lien Secured
Party, including any claims secured by the Collateral, in each case, to the extent not inconsistent with the terms of
the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

Notwithstanding anything in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement or any other documents relating to the security
granted with respect to the Credit Agreement Obligations to the contrary, Collateral consisting of cash and Cash
Equivalents pledged to secure the Credit Agreement Obligations consisting of reimbursement obligations in respect
of Letters of Credit (as defined in the Credit Agreement) (solely to the extent pledged for the benefit of the relevant
Letter of Credit issuer and any participants therein) shall be applied as specified in the Credit Agreement and will
not constitute Shared Collateral.

Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens on the Collateral, the Applicable Collateral Agent (acting on the
instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative), may deal with the Collateral as if such Applicable
Collateral Agent had a senior Lien on such Collateral. No representative of any Non-Controlling Secured Party may
contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the Applicable Collateral Agent, the
Applicable Authorized Representative or the Controlling Secured Party. Each of the First Lien Secured Parties also
have agreed that it will not (and have agreed to waive any right to) question or contest or support any other Person in
contesting, in any proceeding (including any Insolvency Proceeding), the perfection, priority, validity, attachment or
enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf of any of the First Lien Secured Parties on all or any part of the
Collateral or the provisions of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and the Applicable Collateral Agent or any other First Lien
Secured Party is taking action to enforce rights in respect of any Collateral, or any distribution is made in respect of
any Collateral in any Insolvency Proceeding of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including any adequate protection
payments) or any of the holders of the Notes, the Credit Agreement Secured Parties, the 2025 Senior Notes Secured
Parties and the holders of any other First Lien Obligations receives any payment pursuant to any intercreditor
agreement (other than the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) with respect to any Collateral, the proceeds of any
sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Collateral by any Authorized Representative or any holder of First
Lien Obligations or received by any Authorized Representative pursuant to such intercreditor agreement with
respect to any Collateral and proceeds of any such distribution (after payment of the costs of enforcement and
collateral administration) (subject, in the case of any such payments, proceeds or distribution, to the sentence
immediately following) to which the First Lien Obligations are entitled under any intercreditor agreement (other
than the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) shall be distributed ratably to the applicable Authorized Representatives
for further distribution to the holders of the Notes and the Notes Obligations, the holders of Credit Agreement
Obligations, the holders of the 2025 Senior Notes Obligations and the holders of any Future First Lien Indebtedness
after payment of all amounts owing to the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent, the Collateral Agent and each
collateral agent with respect to Future First Lien Obligations; provided that following the commencement of any
Insolvency Proceeding with respect to the Issuer or any Guarantor, solely as among the holders of First Lien
Obligations and solely for purposes of the corresponding paragraph in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and
not any other documents governing First Lien Obligations, in the event the value of the Collateral is not sufficient
for the entire amount of post-petition interest, fees, or expenses on the First Lien Obligations to be allowed under
Section 506(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other
Bankruptcy Law in such Insolvency Proceeding, the amount of First Lien Obligations of each Series of First Lien
Obligations shall include only the maximum amount of post-petition interest, fees, or expenses on the First Lien

164


-----

Obligations allowable under Section 506(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable provision of the
Bankruptcy Code or other Bankruptcy Law in such Insolvency Proceeding.

The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement provides that it is the intention of the First Lien Secured Parties of each
Series that the holders of First Lien Obligations of such Series (and not the First Lien Secured Parties of any other
Series) bear the risk of (i) any determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that (x) any of the First Lien
Obligations of such Series are unenforceable under applicable law or are subordinated to any other obligations
(other than another Series of First Lien Obligations), (y) any of the First Lien Obligations of such Series do not have
a valid and perfected security interest in any of the Collateral securing any other Series of First Lien Obligations
and/or (z) any intervening security interest exists securing any other obligations (other than another Series of First
Lien Obligations) on a basis ranking prior to the security interest of such Series of First Lien Obligations but junior
to the security interest of any other Series of First Lien Obligations or (ii) the existence of any Collateral for any
other Series of First Lien Obligations that is not Collateral for such Series of First Lien Obligations (any such
condition referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii) with respect to any Series of First Lien Obligations, an
“Impairment” of such Series). In the event of any Impairment with respect to any Series of First Lien Obligations,
the results of such Impairment shall be borne solely by the holders of such Series of First Lien Obligations, and the
rights of the holders of such Series of First Lien Obligations (including, without limitation, the right to receive
distributions in respect of such Series of First Lien Obligations pursuant to the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement) set forth herein shall be modified to the extent necessary so that the effects of such Impairment are
borne solely by the holders of the Series of such First Lien Obligations subject to such Impairment. Additionally, in
the event the First Lien Obligations of any Series are modified pursuant to applicable law (including, without
limitation, pursuant to Section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code or any equivalent provision of any other Bankruptcy
Law), any reference to such First Lien Obligations or the First Lien Documents governing such First Lien
Obligations shall refer to such obligations or such documents as so modified.

If, at any time the Applicable Collateral Agent forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any
Collateral resulting in a sale or disposition thereof, then (whether or not any Insolvency Proceeding is pending at the
time) the Collateral Agent’s Liens on such Collateral will automatically be released and discharged as and when, but
only to the extent, the Applicable Collateral Agent’s Liens on such Collateral are released and discharged. The
Collateral Agent will execute and deliver all such authorizations and other instruments as shall be reasonably
requested by the Applicable Collateral Agent (at the Issuer’s and the Guarantor’s sole cost and expense) to evidence
and confirm any such release.

Under the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, if the Collateral Agent or the holders of the Notes (or any
Authorized Representative in respect of, or any holders of, any other First Lien Obligations) shall obtain possession
of any Collateral or shall realize any proceeds or payment in respect of any such Collateral, pursuant to any First
Lien Document or by the exercise of any rights available to it under applicable law or in any Insolvency Proceeding
or through any other exercise of remedies (including pursuant to any intercreditor agreement), at any time prior to
the discharge of each of the First Lien Obligations, then it shall hold such Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust
for the other First Lien Secured Parties and promptly transfer such Collateral, proceeds or payment, as the case may
be, to the Applicable Collateral Agent, to be distributed in accordance with the provisions of the terms of the First
Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

If the Issuer and/or any Guarantor shall become subject to a case or proceeding (an “Insolvency Proceeding”) under
any applicable Bankruptcy Law and shall, as debtor(s)-in-possession, move or be the subject of a motion for
approval of financing (in this section, a “DIP Financing”) to be provided by one or more lenders (the “DIP
Lenders”) under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11.2 of the CCAA, 50.6 of the BIA or any equivalent
provision of any other Bankruptcy Law and/or the use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code
or any equivalent provision of any other Bankruptcy Law, each holder of First Lien Obligations (other than the
Applicable Authorized Representative or any holder of First Lien Obligations in the Series of First Lien Obligations
whose collateral agent is the Applicable Authorized Representative for such Collateral (a “Controlling Secured
Party”)) will agree that it will raise no objection to any such financing or to the Liens (including court-ordered
charges) on the Collateral securing the same (“DIP Financing Liens”) or to any use of cash collateral that constitutes
Collateral unless the Applicable Collateral Agent shall then oppose or object to such DIP Financing or such DIP
Financing Liens and/or use of cash collateral (and (i) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens are senior to the
Liens on any such Collateral for the benefit of the Controlling Secured Parties, each holder of First Lien Obligations
that is not a Controlling Secured Party with respect to such Collateral (a “Non-Controlling Secured Party”) will
subordinate its Liens with respect to such Collateral on the same terms as the Liens of the Controlling Secured

165


-----

Parties (other than any Liens of any holders of First Lien Obligations constituting DIP Financing Liens) are
subordinated thereto, and (ii) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens rank pari passu with the Liens on any such
Collateral granted to secure the First Lien Obligations of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling
Secured Party will confirm the priorities with respect to such Collateral as set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement), in each case so long as (A) the holders of First Lien Obligations of each Series retain the benefit of
their Liens on all such Collateral pledged to the DIP Lenders, including proceeds, products, offspring, profits or
rents, as applicable, thereof arising after the commencement of such proceeding, with the same priority vis-a-vis all
the other holders of First Lien Obligations (other than any Liens of any holders of First Lien Obligations constituting
DIP Financing Liens) as existed prior to the commencement of the Insolvency Proceeding, (B) the holders of First
Lien Obligations of each Series are granted Liens on any additional or replacement collateral pledged to any holders
of First Lien Obligations as adequate protection or otherwise in connection with such DIP Financing and/or use of
cash collateral, with the same priority vis-a-vis the Liens of the other holders of First Lien Obligations as set forth in
the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement (other than any Liens of any holders of First Lien Obligations constituting
DIP Financing Liens), (C) if any amount of such DIP Financing and/or cash collateral is applied to repay any of the
First Lien Obligations, such amount is applied pursuant to the “waterfall provisions” of the First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement and (D) if any holders of First Lien Obligations are granted adequate protection with respect to the First
Lien Obligations subject to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, including in the form of periodic payments, in
connection with such DIP Financing and/or use of cash collateral, the proceeds of such adequate protection are
applied pursuant to the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement; provided that the holders of First Lien
Obligations of each Series shall have a right to object to the grant of a Lien to secure the DIP Financing over any
Collateral subject to Liens in favor of the holders of First Lien Obligations of such Series or its Authorized
Representative that shall not constitute Collateral; provided, further, that the holders of First Lien Obligations
receiving adequate protection shall not object to any other holder of First Lien Obligations receiving adequate
protection comparable to any adequate protection granted to such holders in connection with a DIP Financing and/or
use of cash collateral.

**Additional Amounts**

All payments in respect of the Notes or any Guarantee by or on behalf of the Issuer, any Guarantor, or any successor
thereto (each, a “Payor”) shall be made free and clear of, and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of,
any present or future taxes, levies, duties, imposts, assessments or other governmental charges, including any
interest, additions to tax and penalties related thereto (collectively, “Taxes”), unless such withholding or deduction
is required by applicable law.

If any Payor, or any other applicable withholding agent, is required to withhold or deduct any amount in respect of
any payment made in respect of the Notes or any Guarantee with respect to any Tax imposed by or on behalf of any
jurisdiction in which any Payor is, at any time, organized, resident or doing business for tax purposes, or any
jurisdiction from or through which any Payor or any paying agent (on behalf of any Payor) makes any payments on
the Notes or any Guarantee, or, in each case, any governmental authority or political subdivision thereof or therein
having the power to tax (each, a “Relevant Tax Jurisdiction”), the Payor will, subject to the exceptions and
limitations set forth below, pay such additional amounts (“Additional Amounts”) as are necessary so that the net
payment received by a beneficial owner of the Notes (including any Additional Amounts), after withholding or
deduction for any Taxes of any Relevant Tax Jurisdiction (including in respect of any Additional Amounts) will
equal the amount such beneficial owner would have received in respect of such payment had no such withholding or
deduction been required. A Payor’s obligation to pay Additional Amounts shall not apply:

(a) to any Taxes that are imposed by reason of the holder (or the beneficial owner for whose benefit such holder
holds such Note), or a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of the holder if the holder is an
estate, trust, partnership or corporation, or a person holding a power over an estate or trust administered by a
fiduciary holder, being considered as:

(i) being or having been engaged in a trade or business in the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction or having or having
had a permanent establishment in the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction; or

(ii) having any other current or former connection with the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction (other than a
connection arising solely as a result of the acquisition, ownership or disposition of the Notes or a
beneficial interest therein, the receipt of any payment in respect of a Note or any Guarantee or the

166


-----

enforcement of any rights hereunder or thereunder), including being or having been a citizen or resident
of the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction;

(b) to any Taxes that are imposed or withheld because the holder or beneficial owner failed to accurately comply
with a request from a Payor to meet certification, identification or information or other reporting requirements
concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the holder or beneficial owner of the Notes or otherwise
establish any available exemption from or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, such Taxes (if
such holder or beneficial owner is legally eligible to satisfy such requirements, exemptions or reductions), in
each case, if compliance with such action is required as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in,
such Tax by a Relevant Tax Jurisdiction;

(c) to any Taxes that are imposed other than by withholding or deduction by a Payor or other applicable
withholding agent in respect of a payment with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee;

(d) to any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, wealth or similar Taxes;

(e) to any Taxes that are imposed as a result of the presentation of a Note for payment (where presentation is
required) more than 30 days after the relevant amount is first made available for payment to the holder (except
to the extent that the holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Note been presented on
the last day of such 30-day period);

(f) to any Canadian withholding Taxes that are imposed on payment on the Notes or Guarantees under the
Income Tax Act (Canada) as a result of (i) the holder or beneficial owner not dealing at arm’s length (for the
purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada)) with the Issuer at the time such payment is made, or (ii) the holder
or beneficial owner being a “specified non-resident shareholder” (as defined in subsection 18(5) of the
Income Tax Act (Canada)) of the Issuer at the time of payment or not dealing at arm’s length (for the purposes
of the Income Tax Act (Canada)) with a “specified shareholder” (as defined in subsection 18(5) of the Income
Tax Act (Canada)) of the Issuer at the time of payment, as applicable;

(g) to any Tax imposed pursuant to current Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (or any amended or successor
version that is substantively comparable and not materially more onerous to comply with), any current or
future regulations or official interpretations thereof, any agreement entered into pursuant to current Section
1471(b) of the Code (or any amended or successor version described above), or any intergovernmental
agreements, treaties, conventions or similar agreements (and any related laws, regulations or administrative
guidance) implementing the foregoing;

(h) to any Taxes that are imposed on or with respect to any payment by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor
to the holder if such holder is a fiduciary, partnership, limited liability company or person other than the sole
beneficial owner of such payment to the extent that, had the sole beneficial owner of such Note been the
holder and had such Taxes been imposed on the sole beneficial owner, no Additional Amounts in respect of
such Taxes would have been payable as a result of clauses (a)-(g) or (i) of this “Additional Amounts” section;
or

(i) to any combination of the above items (the foregoing Taxes described in clauses (a)-(i), “Excluded Taxes”).

For purposes of this Additional Amounts section, including clause (c) above, any Tax imposed pursuant to
Regulation 803 of the Income Tax Act (Canada) shall be treated as a Tax withheld by an applicable withholding
agent even though such tax is payable directly by the holder or beneficial owner.

At least 30 calendar days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the Notes or any
Guarantee is due and payable, if a Payor will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to such payment
(unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises after the 35th day prior to the date on which such payment
is due and payable, in which case it will be promptly thereafter), the Payor will deliver to the Trustee an officers’
certificate of the Issuer stating that such Additional Amounts will be payable and the amounts so payable and will
set forth such other information necessary to enable the Trustee (or the applicable paying agent) to pay such
Additional Amounts to holders on the payment date.

The applicable Payor, if it is the applicable withholding agent, will make any required withholding or deduction and
remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The
Issuer will provide the Trustees (and, upon request, any holders or beneficial owners of the Notes) with official

167


-----

receipts or other documentation evidencing the payment of the Taxes with respect to which Additional Amounts are
paid.

The Issuer and the Guarantors will pay and indemnify each holder of Notes for any present or future stamp, court,
issue, registration or documentary Taxes or any other excise, property or similar Taxes that are levied by any
Relevant Tax Jurisdiction from the execution, delivery, enforcement or registration of the Notes (other than in
respect of a transfer of a Note, to someone other than the Issuer or its Affiliates, that occurs after the sale of such
Note to an investor pursuant to this offering), the Guarantees, the indenture or any other document or instrument in
relation thereof, or the receipt of any payments with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee (limited, solely in the
case of Taxes attributable to the receipt of any payments with respect thereto, to any such Taxes levied by a
Relevant Tax Jurisdiction that are not excluded under clauses (a), (b) and (d) through (h) or any combination
thereof). Whenever in the indenture there is mentioned in any context: the payment of principal, redemption prices
or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of Notes, interest, or any other amount payable with
respect to any of the Notes or any Guarantee, such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional
Amounts as described under this heading to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would
be payable in respect thereof.

The above obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the indenture, and any transfer by a
holder or beneficial owner of its Notes and will apply mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, to any Payor and to
any jurisdiction in which such successor is organized or is otherwise resident or doing business for tax purposes or
any jurisdiction from or through which payment is made by such successor or its respective agents.

**Optional Redemption**

_General.  Except as provided below and under the heading “Change of Control”, the Notes will not be redeemable_
at our option prior to      , 2024. Thereafter, the Notes will be subject to redemption at our option, in whole or in
part, upon not less than 10 days’ or more than 60 days’ written notice, at the redemption prices (expressed as
percentages of principal amount) set forth below, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the applicable
redemption date (subject to the rights of holders of record of the Notes on the relevant record date to receive
payments of interest on the related interest payment date), if redeemed during the 12-month period beginning on
of the years indicated below:

**Year** **Percentage**

2024 .................................................................................................................................................... %

2025 .................................................................................................................................................... %

2026 and thereafter ............................................................................................................................. 100.000%

_Equity sales.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time and from time to time prior to     , 2024, we may_
redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding at a redemption price equal to     %
of the principal amount thereof on the repurchase date, together with accrued and unpaid interest to such redemption
date (subject to the rights of holders of record of the Notes on the relevant record date to receive payments of
interest on the related interest payment date), with an amount equal to the net cash proceeds of one or more public or
private sales of Qualified Capital Stock (each an “Equity Offering”), other than proceeds from a sale to the Issuer or
any of its Subsidiaries or any employee benefit plan in which the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries participates;
_provided that:_

- at least 60% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes originally issued remains outstanding immediately after
the occurrence of such redemption (including Additional Notes but excluding Notes held by the Issuer or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries) unless all such Notes are redeemed substantially concurrently; and

- such redemption occurs no later than the 120[th] day following such sale of Qualified Capital Stock.

_Make whole.  In addition, at any time and from time to time prior to     , 2024, we may redeem all or any_
portion of the Notes outstanding at a redemption price equal to:

- 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, together with accrued and unpaid interest
to such redemption date (subject to the rights of holders of record of the Notes on the relevant record date to
receive payments of interest on the related interest payment date), plus

- the Make Whole Amount.

168


-----

“Make Whole Amount” means, with respect to any Note at any redemption date, as determined by us, the greater of
(i) 1.0% of the principal amount of such Note and (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) an amount equal to the present value
of (1) the redemption price of such Note at       , 2024 plus (2) the remaining scheduled interest payments on the
Notes to be redeemed (subject to the right of holders on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
relevant interest payment date) to     , 2024 (other than interest accrued to the redemption date), computed using
a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate plus 50 basis points, over (B) the principal amount of the Notes to be
redeemed. The Trustee shall have no obligation to calculate or verify the calculation of the Make Whole Amount.

“Treasury Rate” means, at the time of computation as calculated by us, the weekly average for each Business Day
during the most recent week that has ended at least two Business Days prior to the redemption date of the yield to
maturity of United States Treasury Securities with a constant maturity (as compiled and published in the most recent
Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (or, if such statistical release is not so published or available or the relevant
information no longer available thereon, any publicly available source of similar market data selected by the Issuer
in good faith) most nearly equal to the period from the redemption date to       , 2024; provided, however, that
if the period from the redemption date to       , 2024 is not equal to the constant maturity of a United States
Treasury security for which a yield is given, the Treasury Rate shall be obtained by linear interpolation (calculated
to the nearest one-twelfth of a year) from the yields of United States Treasury Securities for which such yields are
given, except that if the period from the redemption date to    , 2024 is less than one year, the weekly average
yield on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year shall be used.

In connection with any redemption of Notes described above, such redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be
subject to one or more conditions precedent, including any related Equity Offering, issuance of Indebtedness or
other transaction. If such redemption or notice is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such
notice shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded,
or the redemption date may be delayed or extended, in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been
satisfied by the redemption date.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Notes, including a Change of Control
Offer, if holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do
not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer or Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third party making
such tender offer or Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60
days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase date, to redeem all Notes that remain
outstanding following such purchase at a redemption price equal to the price offered to each other holder (excluding
any early tender or incentive fee) in such tender offer or Change of Control Offer plus, to the extent not included in
the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the date of such redemption.

_Tax Redemption. If (a) the Issuer or any Guarantor becomes or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts_
with respect to any Notes or any Guarantee (as described under the heading “—Additional Amounts” above) as a
result of (1) any change in, or amendment to, the laws, treaties (including protocols), regulations or rulings of a
Relevant Tax Jurisdiction, which change or amendment is first publicly announced and becomes effective after the
Issue Date (or, if the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction did not become a Relevant Tax Jurisdiction until a later date, after
such later date) or (2) any change in the official interpretation or application of the laws, treaties (including
protocols), regulations or rulings of a Relevant Tax Jurisdiction (including by virtue of a holding, judgment or order
by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice), which change is first publicly
announced and becomes effective after the Issue Date (or, if the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction did not become a
Relevant Tax Jurisdiction until a later date, after such later date), and (b) such obligation cannot be avoided by the
Issuer’s taking reasonable measures available to the Issuer or any Guarantor (provided that changing the jurisdiction
of the Issuer or any Guarantor is not a reasonable measure for this purpose), the Issuer may at its option, having
given not less than 30 days’ notice to the holders of such Notes (which notice shall be irrevocable), redeem all, but
not a portion of, the Notes at any time a price equal to their principal amount plus interest accrued to, but excluding,
the date of redemption (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on
the relevant interest payment date), provided that no such notice of redemption shall be given earlier than 60 days
prior to the earliest date on which the Issuer or any Guarantor would be obliged to pay such Additional Amounts
were a payment in respect of the Notes then due); and provided further that in the case of a Guarantor, no
redemption shall be permitted under this “Tax Redemption” section if the Issuer or any other Guarantor can make
payments on the Notes without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts. Prior to the publication or, where
relevant, mailing of any notice of redemption pursuant to this paragraph, the Issuer shall deliver to the Trustee (i) an

169


-----

officers’ certificate of the Issuer certifying that the requirements described in clauses (a) and (b) above are satisfied,
and (ii) an opinion of an independent counsel of recognized standing to the effect that the Issuer or any Guarantor
has or will become obliged to pay such Additional Amounts as a result of a change or amendment described in
clause (a) above. The Trustee shall accept, and will be entitled to conclusively rely on, such officers’ certificate and
opinion of counsel as sufficient evidence of the existence and satisfaction of the conditions described in clauses (a)
and (b) above, and upon such acceptance by the Trustee the Issuer will be entitled to give notice of redemption
hereunder and such notice of redemption will be conclusive and binding on the holders of the Notes.

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, selection of Notes for redemption will be made on a pro
_rata basis, or, in the case of a redemption other than as described under “—Optional Redemption—Equity sales,” by_
lot; provided that all redemptions of interest in global notes held by the depositary shall be made in accordance with
the procedures of the depositary; provided that no Notes with a principal amount of $2,000 or less shall be redeemed
in part. Notice of redemption will be transmitted at least 10 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to
each holder of Notes to be redeemed at its registered address. If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice
of redemption that relates to such Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. On
and after the redemption date, so long as we do not default in the payment of the redemption price, interest will
cease to accrue on Notes or portions thereof called for redemption.

**Change of Control**

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, we will be required to make an offer (a “Change of Control Offer”) to
each holder of Notes to repurchase all or any part (equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof) of such holder’s
Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid
interest thereon to the date of repurchase (subject to the rights of holders of record of the Notes on the relevant
record date to receive payments of interest on the related interest payment date) (in either case, the “Change of
Control Payment”). Within 30 days following any Change of Control, we will be required to send a notice to each
holder electronically in accordance with the procedures of the depository or by first-class mail with a copy to the
Trustee stating:

(1) that the Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the covenant described under “—Change of
Control”;

(2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which shall be no earlier than 30 days and not later than 60 days
after the date such notice is sent (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) that any Notes not tendered will continue to accrue interest in accordance with the terms of the indenture;

(4) that, unless we default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Notes accepted for payment
pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date;

(5) that holders will be entitled to withdraw their election if the paying agent receives, not later than the close of
business on the second Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date, a notice sent
electronically in accordance with the procedures of the depository or by first-class mail setting forth the name
of the holder, the principal amount of Notes delivered for purchase, and a statement that such holder is
unconditionally withdrawing its election to have such Notes purchased;

(6) that holders whose Notes are being purchased only in part will be issued new Notes equal in principal amount
to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, which unpurchased portion must be equal to $2,000 in
principal amount or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof; and

(7) any other information material to such holder’s decision to tender Notes.

We will be required to comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities
laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the
repurchase of the Notes required in the event of a Change of Control and will not be deemed to have violated the
“Change of Control” provisions of the indenture as a result of such compliance. We will not be required to make a
Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the
manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the indenture applicable to
Change of Control Offer made by us. Our obligations in respect of a Change of Control Offer can be modified with

170


-----

the consent of holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding at any time prior to
the occurrence of a Change of Control. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer
may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement
is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer.

Due to our leveraged structure and the terms of other indebtedness to which we and our Subsidiaries are or may in
the future be subject, we may not be able to repurchase all of the Notes tendered upon a Change of Control. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—Upon a change of control, we may not have the funds necessary to
finance the change of control offer required by the indenture governing the notes, which would violate the terms of
the notes.” If we fail to repurchase all of the Notes tendered for purchase upon a Change of Control, such failure will
constitute an Event of Default. In addition, the occurrence of certain of the events which would constitute a Change
of Control would require an offer to purchase the 2025 Senior Notes and may require an offer to purchase the
Financing Notes and would constitute an event of default under the Credit Agreement and may constitute an event
of default under future Indebtedness. Moreover, the exercise by the holders of their right to require us to purchase
the Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the
financial effect of the repurchase on us. Finally, our ability to pay cash to the holders upon a Change of Control may
be limited by our then existing financial resources.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a phrase relating to the sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease
or other disposition of “all or substantially all” of our assets. Although there is a developing body of case law
interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable
law. Accordingly, if we dispose of less than all our assets by any of the means described above, the ability of a
holder of Notes to require us to repurchase its Notes may be uncertain.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the indenture does not contain any provisions that
permit the holders of the Notes to require that we repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover,
recapitalization or similar transaction.

**Certain Covenants**

_Limitation on Restricted Payments._

The indenture provides that neither we nor any of our Restricted Subsidiaries may, directly or indirectly:

(a) pay any dividend or make any distribution on account of any Equity Interests of us other than dividends or
distributions payable in Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of us;

(b) purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for value any of our Equity Interests or any Subordinated
Indebtedness, other than (i) Subordinated Indebtedness within one year of the stated maturity date thereof and
(ii) any such Equity Interests or Subordinated Indebtedness owned by us or by any Restricted Subsidiary;

(c) pay any dividend or make any distribution on account of any Equity Interests of any Restricted Subsidiary,
other than:

(i) to us or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(ii) to all holders of any class or series of Equity Interests of such Restricted Subsidiary on a pro rata basis;
or

(d) make any Restricted Investment

(all such prohibited payments and actions set forth in clauses (a) through (d) being collectively referred to as
“Restricted Payments”), unless at the time of such Restricted Payment:

(i) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would occur as a consequence
thereof;

(ii) after giving pro forma effect to such Restricted Payment and any related transactions, the Issuer is able
to incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness in compliance with the first paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness”; and

(iii) such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate of all other Restricted Payments made after
November 2, 2020, is less than the sum of:

171


-----

(A) 50% of the Consolidated Net Income of the Issuer for the period (taken as one accounting period)
from July 1, 2020 to the end of our most recently ended fiscal quarter for which internal financial
statements are available at the time of such Restricted Payment (or, if such Consolidated Net
Income shall be a deficit, minus 100% of such aggregate deficit); plus

(B) an amount equal to the sum of (x) 100% of the aggregate net cash proceeds and the Fair Market
Value of any property or assets received by us from the issue or sale of Equity Interests (other
than Disqualified Stock) of us (other than Equity Interests sold to any of our Subsidiaries),
following the Issue Date and (y) the aggregate amount by which Indebtedness (other than any
Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Subsidiary) incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted

Preferred Stock is issued, after giving effect to such issuance (and the payment of dividends or distributions)
on a pro forma basis, would have been at least 2.00 to 1.00 and (b) the aggregate amount of dividends
declared and paid pursuant to this clause (9) does not exceed the net cash proceeds actually received by the
Issuer from any such sale of Designated Preferred Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) issued after the Issue
Date;

(10) any Restricted Payment if after giving effect to such Restricted Payment, the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of
the Issuer on a pro forma basis is equal to or less than 3.75 to 1.00;

Restricted Payments made pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant and clause (1) of the second paragraph of
this covenant and, to the extent made with the proceeds of the issuance of Qualified Capital Stock, Investments
made pursuant to clause (j) of the definition of “Permitted Investments” shall be included as Restricted Payments in
any computation made pursuant to clause (iii) of the first paragraph of this covenant. Restricted Payments made
pursuant to clauses (2) through (10) and (12) of the second paragraph of this covenant shall not be included as
Restricted Payments in any computation made pursuant to clause (iii) of the first paragraph of this covenant.

If we or any Restricted Subsidiary makes a Restricted Investment and the Person in which such Investment was
made subsequently becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, to the extent such Investment resulted in a reduction in the
amounts calculated under clause (iii) of the first paragraph of or under any other provision of this covenant (which
was not subsequently reversed), then such amount shall be increased by the amount of such reduction.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a Restricted Payment (or portion
thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories described in the clauses above, or is permitted pursuant
to the first paragraph of this covenant the Issuer will be entitled to divide or classify (or later divide, classify or
reclassify in whole or in part in its sole discretion) such Restricted Payment (or portion thereof) in any manner that
complies with this covenant.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of such Restricted
Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The fair market value of any cash Restricted
Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any non-cash Restricted Payment, property or assets
other than cash shall be determined conclusively by the Issuer acting in good faith.

If the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary makes a Restricted Payment which at the time of the making of such
Restricted Payment would in the good faith determination of the Issuer be permitted under the provisions of the
Indenture, such Restricted Payment shall be deemed to have been made in compliance with the Indenture
notwithstanding any subsequent adjustments made in good faith to the Issuer’s financial statements affecting
Consolidated Net Income or Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer for any period.

_Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness_

The indenture provides that we shall not, and shall not permit any of our Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or
indirectly, create, incur, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable with respect to
(collectively, “incur”) any Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) or permit any of our Restricted Subsidiaries to
issue any Preferred Equity Interests; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer and any
Restricted Subsidiary may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) and any Guarantor may issue Preferred
Equity Interests, if, after giving effect to the incurrence of such Indebtedness or the issuance of such Preferred
Equity Interests and the application of the net proceeds thereof on a pro forma basis, our Consolidated Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0; provided that Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer that are not
Guarantors may not incur Indebtedness or issue any Preferred Equity Interests pursuant to this paragraph if, after
giving pro forma effect to such incurrence or issuance (including a pro forma application of the net proceeds
therefrom), the aggregate amount of outstanding Indebtedness or Preferred Equity Interests of Restricted

174

Subsidiaries of the Issuer that are not Guarantors at any one time outstanding incurred pursuant to the foregoing
proviso and pursuant to clause 4(a) of the next paragraph, together with the amount of any Refinancing Indebtedness

recently ended Measurement Period (calculated on a pro forma basis) and (b) an amount of First Lien
Indebtedness that would not cause the Consolidated First Lien Indebtedness Leverage Ratio (calculated after
giving pro forma effect to the incurrence of such Indebtedness, the application of proceeds therefrom, the
granting of such Liens and any other related transactions) to be greater than 5.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of
the most recent quarter for which internal financial statements are available on the date such Indebtedness is
incurred, plus the amount of any accrued interest and any premiums payable and reasonable fees, expenses,
commissions and costs in connection with the exchange, extension, refinancing, renewal, replacement,
substitution or refunding of any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (2);

to the incurrence of such Indebtedness or Acquired Debt on a pro forma basis, our Consolidated Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio either (A) would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0 or (B) would have been greater than
immediately prior to such acquisition; provided, further, that all Indebtedness incurred, issued or assumed
pursuant to subclause (4)(a) and pursuant to the proviso in the first paragraph of this covenant, together with
the amount of any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof incurred pursuant to clause (10) of this
covenant, by Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors or the Issuer shall not exceed an amount equal to
the greater of (x) $50 million or (y) 25% of Consolidated EBITDA for the most recently ended Measurement
Period (calculated on a pro forma basis);

(6) Indebtedness consisting of Purchase Money Indebtedness in an aggregate amount (when aggregated with the
amount of Refinancing Indebtedness outstanding under clause (10) below in respect of Indebtedness incurred
pursuant to this clause (6)) not to exceed an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding equal to
the greater of (x) $60 million or (y) 30% of Consolidated EBITDA for the most recently ended Measurement
Period (calculated on a pro forma basis);

(7) Hedging Obligations of us or any of our Restricted Subsidiaries covering Indebtedness of us or such
Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that such Hedging Obligations are entered into for bona fide
hedging activities, including the issuance of convertible debt, and not for speculative purposes;

relating to liabilities or obligations incurred on behalf of, a Professional Services Affiliate, incurred in the

(27) obligations under or in respect of Receivables Facilities.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (a) the outstanding principal amount of any item of
Indebtedness shall be counted only once, and any obligation arising under any guarantee, Lien, letter of credit or
similar instrument supporting such Indebtedness incurred in compliance with this covenant shall be disregarded, and
(b) if an item of Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the categories described in clauses (1) through
(27) above or is permitted to be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant and also meets the criteria
of one or more of the categories described in clauses (1) through (27) above, we shall, in our sole discretion, classify
such item of Indebtedness in any manner that complies with this covenant and may from time to time reclassify such
item of Indebtedness in any manner in which such item could be incurred at the time of such reclassification;
_provided that Indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Agreement on the Issue Date (and any Indebtedness secured_
by a Lien that refinances such Indebtedness) shall be deemed to be outstanding under clause (2) above and may not
be reclassified.

Accrual of interest or dividends on Preferred Equity Interests, the accretion of original issue discount and the
payment of interest or dividends on Preferred Equity Interests in the form of additional Indebtedness or Preferred
Equity Interests of the same class will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of
determining compliance with this covenant. Any increase in the amount of Indebtedness solely by reason of
currency fluctuations will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of determining
compliance with this covenant. A change in GAAP that results in an obligation existing at the time of such change,
not previously classified as Indebtedness, becoming Indebtedness will not be deemed to be an incurrence of
Indebtedness for purposes of determining compliance with this covenant.

The amount of indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (1) the accreted value thereof, in the case of any
Indebtedness issued with original issue discount, (2) the principal amount thereof, in the case of any other
Indebtedness, (3) in the case of the guarantee by the specified Person of any Indebtedness of any other Person, the
maximum liability to which the specified Person may be subject upon the occurrence of the contingency giving rise
to the obligation and (4) in the case of Indebtedness of others guaranteed by means of a Lien on any asset of the
specified Person, the lesser of (A) the Fair Market Value of such asset on the date on which Indebtedness is required
to be determined pursuant to the indenture and (B) the amount of the Indebtedness so secured.

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of
Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall
be calculated by us based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was
incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit Indebtedness; provided
that if such Indebtedness is incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such
refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-dominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant
currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar-dominated restriction shall be
deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed
the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant,
the maximum amount of Indebtedness that we may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be
exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any
Indebtedness incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, (1) if incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness
being refinanced, shall be calculated by us based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which
such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing and (2) shall be
deemed to be outstanding only when the proceeds thereof are not applied to effect such refinancing (and to pay any
fees, expenses, commissions and costs in connection therewith) substantially concurrently.

178


-----

Notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness incurred to refinance
Indebtedness initially incurred in reliance on a clause of the second paragraph of this covenant measured by
reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA at the time of incurrence, if such refinancing would cause the
percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of
Consolidated EBITDA on the date of such refinancing, such percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction shall
not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the
principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus accrued and unpaid interest, dividends, premiums
(including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting discounts, fees, costs and expenses (including original
issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) in connection with such refinancing.

The Indenture does not treat unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness merely
because it is unsecured.

_Limitation on Asset Sales._

The indenture provides that we will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly,
consummate any Asset Sale unless:

(1) we or such Restricted Subsidiary receives consideration at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair
Market Value (determined as of the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale) of the assets included in
such Asset Sale); and

(2) other than with respect to Permitted Asset Swaps, at least 75% of the total consideration in such Asset Sale
consists of cash or Cash Equivalents or Marketable Securities.

For purposes of clause (2), the following shall be deemed to be cash:

(a) the amount (without duplication) of any Indebtedness (other than Subordinated Indebtedness) of us or such
Restricted Subsidiary that is expressly assumed by the transferee in such Asset Sale and with respect to which
we or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is unconditionally released by the holder of such
Indebtedness,

(b) the amount of any obligations or securities received from such transferee that are within 180 days converted
by us or such Restricted Subsidiary to cash (to the extent of the cash actually so received),

(c) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset
Sale, to the extent that the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any Guarantee of
payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Sale, and

(d) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset
Sale having an aggregate Fair Market Value, taken together with all other Designated Non-cash Consideration
received pursuant to this clause (c), not to exceed the greater of $20 million and 10% of Consolidated
EBITDA for the most recently ended Measurement Period (calculated on a pro forma basis), with the Fair
Market Value of each item of Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time received and
without giving effect to subsequent changes in value.

If we or any Restricted Subsidiary engages in an Asset Sale, we or such Restricted Subsidiary shall apply all or any
of the Net Proceeds therefrom to:

(1) at our election, either (x) repay First Lien Obligations (and in the case of any such repayment under any
revolving credit facility, effect a permanent reduction in the availability under such revolving credit facility)
or (y) repay, redeem or purchase the Notes; provided that if we repay First Lien Obligations (other than the
Notes) pursuant to clause (x), we will apply a pro rata amount to (i) equally and ratably reduce the Notes
Obligations in accordance with the procedures set forth under “—Optional redemption” and/or (ii) make an
Excess Proceeds Offer; or

(2) (A) invest all or any part of the Net Proceeds thereof in capital expenditures or the purchase of assets to be
used by us or any Restricted Subsidiary in a Permitted Business, (B) acquire Equity Interests in a Person that
is a Restricted Subsidiary or in a Person engaged primarily in a Permitted Business that shall become a
Restricted Subsidiary immediately upon the consummation of such acquisition or (C) a combination of (A)
and (B).

179


-----

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this covenant, (i) to the extent that any of or all the Net Proceeds of any
Asset Sale received or deemed to be received by a Foreign Subsidiary (a “Foreign Disposition”) is (x) prohibited or
delayed by applicable local law or (y) restricted by applicable organizational documents in each case, from being
repatriated to Canada if the Issuer is organized under the laws of Canada or a political subdivision thereof or the
United States, if the Issuer is organized under the laws of the United States or any State thereof or the District of
Columbia, an amount equal to the portion of such Net Proceeds so affected will not be required to be applied in
compliance with this covenant so long, but only so long, as the applicable local law or organizational documents
will not permit repatriation to the United States or Canada, as applicable, (the Issuer hereby agreeing to use
reasonable efforts (as determined in the Issuer’s reasonable business judgment) to otherwise cause the applicable
Foreign Subsidiary to within one year following the date on which the respective payment would otherwise have
been required, promptly take all actions reasonably required by the applicable local law or applicable organizational
impediments to permit such repatriation), and if within one year following the date on which the respective payment
would otherwise have been required, such repatriation of any of such affected Net Proceeds is permitted under the
applicable local law or applicable organizational impediment, an amount equal to such Net Proceeds will be
promptly (and in any event not later than five Business Days after such repatriation could be made) applied (net of
additional Taxes payable or reserved against as a result thereof) (whether or not repatriation actually occurs) in
compliance with this covenant and (ii) to the extent that the Issuer has determined in good faith that repatriation of
any of or all the Net Proceeds of any Foreign Disposition would have an material adverse Tax consequence (which
for the avoidance of doubt, includes, but is not limited to, any prepayment out of such Net Proceeds whereby doing
so the Issuer, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective affiliates and/or equity owners would incur a Tax
liability, including a Tax dividend, deemed dividend pursuant to Code Section 956 or a withholding Tax), an amount
equal to the Net Proceeds so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant. The nonapplication of any prepayment amounts as a consequence of the foregoing provisions will not, for the avoidance of
doubt, constitute a Default or an Event of Default.

Any Net Proceeds from any Asset Sale that are not applied or invested (or committed pursuant to a written
agreement to be applied) as provided in the preceding paragraph within 365 days after the receipt thereof and, in the
case of any amount committed to a reinvestment, which are not actually so applied within 180 days following such
365 day period shall constitute “Excess Proceeds” and shall be applied pursuant to the succeeding paragraph.
Pending the final application of any such Net Proceeds, we or such Restricted Subsidiary may temporarily reduce
revolving indebtedness under a Credit Facility, if any, or otherwise invest such Net Proceeds in any manner not
prohibited by the indenture.

When the cumulative amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $30 million, we will be obligated to make an offer to all
holders of the Notes (an “Excess Proceeds Offer”) to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes that may be
purchased out of such Excess Proceeds at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount
thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest to the date fixed for the closing of such offer in accordance with
the procedures set forth in the indenture. To the extent we or a Restricted Subsidiary is required under the terms of
any First Lien Obligations, we shall also make an offer to the holders of such First Lien Obligations on a pro rata
basis with the holders of the Notes, with such proceeds. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and other First
Lien Obligations surrendered by holders thereof exceeds the amount of such Excess Proceeds, the Trustee shall
select the Notes and other First Lien Obligations and to be purchased on a pro rata basis by lot, and, in the case of
global notes, in accordance with the procedures of the depositary. To the extent that the principal amount of Notes
tendered pursuant to an Excess Proceeds Offer is less than the amount of such Excess Proceeds, we may use any
remaining Excess Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the indenture. Upon completion of an Excess Proceeds
Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

We will be required to comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities
laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the
repurchase of the Notes required in the event of an Excess Proceeds Offer and will not be deemed to have violated
the “Excess Proceeds Offer” provisions of the indenture as a result thereof.

_Limitation on Liens._

The indenture provides that we shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly,
create, incur or assume any Lien (each, an “Initial Lien”) on any asset now owned or hereafter acquired, or on any
income or profits therefrom or assign or convey any right to receive income therefrom, other than (i) Permitted
Liens and (ii) with respect to Liens on assets not constituting Collateral, any such Lien securing Indebtedness if the

180


-----

Notes are secured equally and ratably thereby (or, if such Indebtedness secured by Liens on assets not constituting
Collateral is subordinated to the Notes, the Notes are secured on a priority basis with respect to such Indebtedness).

Any Lien created for the benefit of the Holders pursuant to clause (ii) of the preceding sentence shall provide by its
terms that such Lien shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon the release and
discharge of the Initial Lien.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time of the
incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such
Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such
Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of original
issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of
original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a
result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of property securing Indebtedness.

_Additional Subsidiary Guarantees._

The indenture provides that if any of the Issuer’s Restricted Subsidiaries (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
Professional Services Affiliates) that is not a Guarantor guarantees or becomes otherwise obligated under a Credit
Facility incurred under clause (2) of the second paragraph under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness” or
any Capital Markets Indebtedness (including the 2025 Senior Notes and any Financing Notes) in an aggregate
principal amount greater than $30 million incurred pursuant to the covenant described above under “—Limitation on
Incurrence of Indebtedness” then in each case such Restricted Subsidiary shall (i) execute and deliver to the Trustee
and Collateral Agent a supplemental indenture in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and the Collateral
Agent pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary shall unconditionally guarantee all of the Issuer’s obligations
under the Notes and the indenture on the terms set forth in the indenture, (ii) execute and deliver to the Trustee and
Collateral Agent joinders or supplements, as applicable, to the Collateral Documents and the First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement (and, if applicable, any Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement), together with any other filings and
agreements (subject to customary extension periods) required by the Collateral Documents to create or perfect the
security interests of the Collateral Agent for its benefit and for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes
in the Collateral of such Restricted Subsidiary and (iii) deliver to the Trustee and the Collateral Agent an officers’
certificate and an opinion of counsel certifying that such supplemental indenture and joinders or supplements to the
Collateral Documents and First Lien Intercreditor Agreement (and, if applicable, any Junior Lien Intercreditor
Agreement) have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by such Restricted Subsidiary and constitute legal,
valid, binding and enforceable obligations of such Restricted Subsidiary. Thereafter, such Restricted Subsidiary
shall be a Guarantor for all purposes of the indenture, the Collateral Documents and the First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement (and, if applicable, any Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement).

_Limitation on Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries._

The indenture provides that we shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly,
create or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction on the
ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(a) pay dividends or make any other distribution to us or any of our Restricted Subsidiaries on its Capital Stock or
with respect to any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits, or pay any Indebtedness owed
to us or any of our Restricted Subsidiaries;

(b) make loans or advances to us or any of our Restricted Subsidiaries; or

(c) transfer any of its properties or assets to us or any of our Restricted Subsidiaries; except for such
encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of:

(i) Existing Indebtedness and existing agreements as in effect on the Issue Date;

(ii) applicable law or regulation;

(iii) any instrument governing Acquired Debt and any other agreement or instrument of an acquired Person
or any of its Subsidiaries as in effect at the time of acquisition (except to the extent such Indebtedness or
other agreement or instrument was incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such
acquisition), which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets

181


-----

of any Person, other than the Person, or the property or assets of the Person, so acquired or any of its
Subsidiaries;

(iv) by reason of customary non-assignment provisions in leases entered into in the ordinary course of
business;

(v) Refinancing Indebtedness (as defined in the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness”); provided that the restrictions contained in the agreements
governing such Refinancing Indebtedness are no more restrictive than those contained in the agreements
governing the Indebtedness being refinanced;

(vi) the indenture, the Notes and the Collateral Documents or by our other Indebtedness ranking pari passu
with the Notes; provided that except as set forth in clause (vii) below such restrictions are no more
restrictive taken as a whole than those imposed by the indenture, the Notes and the Collateral
Documents;

(vii) any Indebtedness; provided that the restrictions therein are not (i) materially more restrictive than the
agreements governing such Indebtedness as in effect on the Issue Date or (ii) will not affect the Issuer’s
ability to make principal or interest payments on the Notes (as determined by the Issuer in good faith);

(viii) customary non-assignment provisions in contracts, leases, sub-leases and licenses entered into in the
ordinary course of business;

(ix) any agreement for the sale or other disposition of a Restricted Subsidiary or any of its assets in
compliance with the terms of the indenture that restricts distributions by that Restricted Subsidiary
pending such sale or other disposition;

(x) provisions limiting the disposition or distribution of assets or property (including cash) in joint venture
agreements, asset sale agreements, sale-leaseback agreements, stock sale agreements and other similar
agreements (including agreements entered into in connection with a Restricted Investment), and
customary provisions in joint venture agreements and other similar agreements applicable to the Equity
Interests or Indebtedness of such joint venture, which limitation is applicable only to the assets that are
the subject of such agreements;

(xi) Liens not prohibited by the covenant described above under “—Limitation on Liens”;

(xii) any agreement for the sale of any Subsidiary or its assets that restricts distributions by that Subsidiary
(or sale of such Subsidiary’s Equity Interests) pending its sale; provided that during the entire period in
which such encumbrance or restriction is effective, such sale (together with any other sales pending)
would be permitted under the terms of the indenture;

(xiii) secured Indebtedness otherwise permitted to be incurred by the indenture that limits the right of the
debtor to dispose of the assets securing such Indebtedness;

(xiv) Purchase Money Indebtedness that imposes restrictions of the type described in clause (c) above on the
property so acquired;

(xv) any amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings,
replacements or refinancings of the contracts, instruments or obligations referred to in clauses (i)
through (xiv) above; provided that such amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases,
supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings are, in our good faith judgment, not materially
more restrictive as a whole with respect to such encumbrances and restrictions than those prior to such
amendment, modification, restatement, renewal, increase, supplement, refunding, replacement or
refinancing;

(xvi) Indebtedness or other agreements including, without limitation, agreements described in clause (x) of
this paragraph, of any non-Guarantor Subsidiary which imposes restrictions solely on such nonGuarantor Subsidiary and its Subsidiaries;

(xvii) any restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers, licensors or lessors or
required by insurance, surety or bonding companies, in each case under contracts entered into in the
ordinary course of business; or

182


-----

(xviii) restrictions created in connection with any Receivables Facility that, in the good faith determination of
the Issuer, are necessary or advisable to effect such Receivables Facility.

_Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets._

The indenture provides that we shall not consolidate, amalgamate, participate in an arrangement with or merge with
or into (whether or not we are the surviving entity), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all
or substantially all of our properties or assets in one or more related transactions to, another Person unless:

(a) we are the surviving Person or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation, amalgamation,
arrangement or merger (if other than us) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or
other disposition shall have been made is a corporation, limited partnership or limited liability company
organized or existing under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or Canada or any political
subdivision thereof; provided, however, that if the surviving Person is a limited liability company or limited
partnership, such entity shall also form a co-issuer that is a corporation;

(b) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation, amalgamation, arrangement or merger (if other
than us) or the Person to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition shall
have been made assumes all our obligations under the Notes, the indenture, the Collateral Documents and the
First Lien Intercreditor Agreement (and, if applicable, any Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement) pursuant to a
supplemental indenture and joinders or supplements, as applicable, to the Collateral Documents and the First
Lien Intercreditor Agreement (and, if applicable, any Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement), in each case, in
form reasonably acceptable to the Trustee and the Collateral Agent;

(c) immediately after such transaction, no Event of Default exists; and

(d) we or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation, amalgamation, arrangement or merger (if
other than us) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition will have
been made: (i) will have Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio immediately after the transaction (but
prior to any purchase accounting adjustments or accrual of deferred tax liabilities resulting from the
transaction) not less than our Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio immediately preceding the
transaction or (ii) would, at the time of such transaction after giving pro forma effect thereto as if such
transaction had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, be permitted to incur at least
$1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph in the covenant described under “—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness.”

Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to the second succeeding paragraph, any Restricted Subsidiary may
consolidate, amalgamate with, participate in an arrangement with or merge into or transfer all or part of its
properties and assets to us or another Restricted Subsidiary.

Notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (c) and (d), we may merge or amalgamate with a Restricted Subsidiary solely
for the purpose of reorganizing ourselves in another jurisdiction of the United States or any State thereof or the
District of Columbia or Canada or any political subdivision thereof so long as the amount of Indebtedness of us and
the Restricted Subsidiaries is not increased thereby.

The indenture provides that each Guarantor (other than any Guarantor whose Guarantee is to be released in
accordance with the terms of such Guarantee and the indenture) will not, and we will not cause or permit any
Guarantor to, consolidate, amalgamate, participate in an arrangement with or merge with or into (whether or not
such Guarantor is the surviving entity) any Person other than us or a Guarantor (in each case, other than in
accordance with the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales”) unless:

(a) the Guarantor is the surviving Person or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation,
amalgamation, arrangement or merger (if other than the Guarantor) is a corporation, limited partnership or
limited liability company organized or existing under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the
District of Columbia;

(b) the Person formed by or surviving any such consideration, amalgamation or merger (if other than the
Guarantor) assumes all the obligations of the Guarantor under the indenture, the Notes, the Collateral
Documents and the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement (and, if applicable, any Junior Lien Intercreditor
Agreement) pursuant to a supplemental indenture and joinders or supplements, as applicable, to the Collateral

183


-----

Documents and the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement (and, if applicable, any Junior Lien Intercreditor
Agreement), in each case, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and the Collateral Agent; and

(c) immediately after such transaction, no Event of Default exists.

This section includes a phrase relating to the sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposition of “all
or substantially all” of our properties or assets. Although there is a developing body of case law interpreting the
phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly,
if we dispose of less than all our properties or assets by any of the means described above, the application of the
covenant described in this section may be uncertain.

_Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates._

The indenture provides that we shall not and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, sell,
lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of our or their properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets
from, or enter into any contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or for the benefit of,
any Affiliate (including any Unrestricted Subsidiary and Minority Investment) in any one or a series of transactions
involving aggregate payments in excess of $20 million (or in the case of a Minority Investment, in excess of $10
million) (each of the foregoing, an “Affiliate Transaction”), unless:

(a) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable transaction at the
time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such transaction in arm’s length
dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(b) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of $30 million and
15% of Consolidated EBITDA for the most recently ended measurement period calculated on a pro forma
basis), the terms of such transaction have been approved by a majority of the disinterested members of the
Board of Directors of the Issuer.

Any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in clause (b) of this paragraph
if such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the disinterested directors of the Issuer, if any.

_provided, however, that the following shall, in each case, not be deemed Affiliate Transactions:_

(i) the entry into employment agreements and the adoption of compensation or benefit plans for the benefit
of, or the payment of compensation to, directors and management of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries
(including, without limitation, salaries, fees, bonuses, equity and incentive arrangements and payments);

(ii) indemnification or similar arrangements for officers, directors, employees or agents of us or any of our
Restricted Subsidiaries pursuant to charter, bylaw, statutory or contractual provisions;

(iii) transactions between or among us and our Restricted Subsidiaries;

(iv) Restricted Payments not prohibited by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation
on Restricted Payments” and Permitted Investments;

(v) any transactions between us or any of our Restricted Subsidiaries and any Affiliate of us the Equity
Interests of which Affiliate are owned solely by us or one of our Restricted Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and by Persons who are not Affiliates of us or Restricted Subsidiaries, on the other hand;

(vi) the payment of compensation, fees, costs and expenses to, and indemnities (including under insurance
policies) and reimbursements, employment and severance arrangements, and employee benefit and
pension expenses provided on behalf of, or for the benefit of, future, current or former employees,
directors, officers, managers, contractors, consultants, distributors or advisors of the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary (whether directly or indirectly);

(vii) any agreements or arrangements in effect on the Issue Date and described in this offering memorandum
and any modifications, extensions or renewals thereof that are not disadvantageous to the holders of
Notes in the Issuer’s reasonable determination in any material respect;

(viii) so long as they comply with clause (a) above, transactions with customers, clients, lessors, landlords,
suppliers, contractors, or purchasers or sellers of goods or services that are Affiliates, in each case in the
ordinary course of business and otherwise in compliance with the terms of the indenture;

184


-----

(ix) transactions with Persons who are Affiliates of us solely as a result of our or a Restricted Subsidiary’s
Investment in such Person;

(x) sales of Equity Interests to Affiliates of the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries not otherwise prohibited
by the indenture and the granting of registration and other customary rights in connection therewith;

(xi) transactions with an Affiliate where the only consideration paid is Equity Interests of the Issuer other
than Disqualified Stock;

(xii) transactions in which the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, deliver to the
Trustee a letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is fair to the Issuer
or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or meets the requirements of this covenant;

(xiii) transactions with joint ventures or Unrestricted Subsidiaries entered into in the ordinary course of
business;

(xiv) transactions between the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries and any Person, a director of which
is also a director of the Issuer; provided, however, that such director abstains from voting as a director
on any matter involving such other Person;

(xv) any transition services arrangement, supply arrangement or similar arrangement entered into in
connection with or in contemplation of the disposition of assets or Capital Stock in any Restricted
Subsidiary permitted under “—Limitation on Asset Sales” or entered into with any Business Successor,
in each case, that the Issuer determines in good faith is either fair to the Issuer or otherwise on
customary terms for such type of arrangements in connection with similar transactions;

(xvi) transactions entered into by an Unrestricted Subsidiary with an Affiliate prior to the day such
Unrestricted Subsidiary is redesignated as a Restricted Subsidiary (and not entered into in contemplation
of such redesignation) as described under “—Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries”
and pledges of Capital Stock of Unrestricted Subsidiaries;

(xvii) (i) any lease entered into between the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, as lessee, and any Affiliate of
the Issuer, as lessor and (ii) any operational services arrangement entered into between the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Issuer, in each case, which is approved as being no worse
than a transaction on an arm’s length basis by the reasonable determination of the Issuer;

(xviii) intellectual property licenses and research and development agreements in the ordinary course of
business or consistent with past practice; and

(xix) any customary transaction with a Receivables Subsidiary effected as part of a Receivables Facility in the
ordinary course of business.

_Reports._

So long as the notes are outstanding, the indenture will provide that the Issuer will furnish to the holders of the
Notes and the Trustee:

(1) (x) all annual and quarterly financial statements substantially in forms that would be required to be contained in a
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on Forms 10-K and 10-Q (or successor forms) of the
Issuer, if the Issuer were required to file such forms, plus a “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” and (y) with respect to the annual financial statements only, a report on the
annual financial statements by the Issuer’s independent registered public accounting firm; and

(2) within 10 Business Days after the occurrence of an event required to be therein reported, such other information
containing substantially the same information that would be required to be contained in filings with the SEC on
Form 8-K under Items 1.01, 1.02, 1.03, 2.01 (which, with respect to acquisitions, shall be only with respect to
acquisitions that are “significant” pursuant to clauses (1) and (2) of the definition of “Significant Subsidiary” under
Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X), 2.05, 2.06, 4.01, 4.02, 5.01 and 5.02(b) (only with respect to the principal executive
officer, president, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer and principal operating officer) and (c)
(other than with respect to information otherwise required or contemplated by Item 402 of Regulation S-K
promulgated by the SEC) as in effect on the Issue Date if the Issuer were required to file such reports; provided,
however, that no such current report will be required to include as an exhibit, or to include a summary of the terms

185


-----

of, any employment or compensatory arrangement agreement, plan or understanding between the Issuer (or any of
its Subsidiaries) and any director, manager or executive officer, of the Issuer (or any of its Subsidiaries); provided,
however, that (i) in no event shall such information or reports be required to comply with Rule 3-10 of Regulation SX promulgated by the SEC or contain separate consolidating financial information with respect to, or separate
financial statements or information for, the Issuer, the Guarantors, other Subsidiaries the shares of which are pledged
to secure the Notes or any Guarantee, any Related Corporation or any other affiliate of the Issuer that would be
required under (a) Section 3-09 of Regulation S-X, (b) Section 3-10 of Regulation S-X or (c) Section 3-16 of
Regulation S-X, respectively, promulgated by the SEC, (ii) in no event shall such information or reports be required
to comply with Regulation G under the Exchange Act or Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC with
respect to any non-GAAP financial measures contained therein, (iii) no such information or reports referenced under
clause (2) above shall be required to be furnished if the Issuer determines in its good faith judgment that such event
is not material to the holders of the notes or the business, assets, operations or financial position of the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iv) in no event shall such information or reports be required to include
any information that is not otherwise similar to information currently included in the Offering Memorandum, other
than with respect to information or reports provided under clause (2) above, and (v) in no event shall information or
reports referenced in clause (2) above be required to include as an exhibit copies of any agreements, financial
statements or other items that would be required to be filed as exhibits to a current report on Form 8-K except for (x)
agreements evidencing material Indebtedness and (y) historical and pro forma financial statements to the extent
reasonably available.

All such annual information and reports shall be furnished within 90 days after the end of the fiscal year to which
they relate, and all such quarterly information and reports shall be furnished within 45 days after the end of the fiscal
quarter to which they relate and in each case subject to any extension, tolling or other relief that would be available
to the Issuer under applicable United States or Canadian securities laws and regulations at such time.

Except as provided in the last paragraph of this section, the Issuer will make available such information and reports
(as well as the details regarding the conference call described below) to any holder of notes and, upon request, to
any beneficial owner of the notes, in each case by posting such information and reports on its website, on Intralinks
or any comparable password-protected online data system which will require a confidentiality acknowledgment, and
will make such information and reports readily available to any holder of notes, any bona fide prospective investor
in the notes (which prospective investors shall be limited to “qualified institutional buyers” within the meaning of
Rule 144A of the Securities Act or non-U.S. persons that certify their status as such to the reasonable satisfaction of
the Issuer), any securities analyst (to the extent providing analysis of investment in the notes) or any market maker
in the notes who agrees to treat such information and reports as confidential or accesses such information and
reports on Intralinks or any comparable password-protected online data system which will require a confidentiality
acknowledgment; provided that the Issuer shall post such information and reports thereon and make readily
available any password or other login information to any such holder of notes, bona fide prospective investor,
securities analyst or market maker.

The Issuer will hold a quarterly conference call for all holders of notes and securities analysts (to the extent
providing analysis of investment in the notes) to discuss such financial information (including a customary Q&A
session) no later than ten (10) Business Days after distribution of such financial information (which obligation, for
the avoidance of doubt, shall be satisfied by the Issuer’s regular earnings calls).

In addition, to the extent not satisfied by the foregoing, the Issuer shall furnish to holders of the notes any
prospective investors, upon their request, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4)
under the Securities Act so long as the notes remain outstanding.

Notwithstanding anything else herein, the Issuer will be deemed to have furnished the financial statements and other
information referred to in clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant if the Issuer has filed reports on
the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (“SEDAR”) or any successor system or with the SEC
via the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval (“EDGAR”) filing system or any successor system
thereto; provided that if the Issuer has filed such reports on SEDAR or EDGAR, in order to comply with clauses (1)
and (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer need only file such reports as would be required of it
pursuant to applicable Canadian and United States laws that apply to the Issuer’s public reporting requirements at
such time and nothing more, provided, that, the Trustee shall have no responsibility to determine if any documents
have been filed.

Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and the
Trustee's receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or
determinable from information contained therein, including the Company’s compliance with any of its covenants
hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on officers’ certificates).

**Financial Calculations for Limited Condition Transactions and Compliance Calculations**

When calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the indenture, in each case in connection with a
Limited Condition Transaction and other transactions in connection therewith (including any incurrence or issuance
of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Equity Interests and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence of
any Lien or the making of any Investment or any Restricted Payments), the date of determination of such basket or
ratio and of any Default or Event of Default may, at our option, be the date the definitive agreement(s) for such
Limited Condition Transaction is entered into. Any such ratio or basket shall be calculated on a pro forma basis after
giving effect to such Limited Condition Transaction and other transactions in connection therewith (including any
incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Equity Interests and the use of proceeds
thereof, the incurrence of any Lien or the making of any Investment or any Restricted Payments) as if they had been
consummated at the beginning of the applicable period for purposes of determining the ability to consummate any
such Limited Condition Transaction; provided that if we elect to make such determination as of the date of such
definitive agreement(s), then (x) we shall be deemed to be in compliance with such ratios or baskets solely for
purposes of determining whether the Limited Condition Transaction and other transactions in connection therewith
(including any incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Equity Interests and the use
of proceeds thereof, the incurrence of any Lien or the making of any Investment or any Restricted Payments), is
permitted under the applicable covenants, and (y) such ratios or baskets shall not be tested at the time of
consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction or related transactions; provided, further, that if we elect to
have such determinations occur at the time of entry into such definitive agreement(s), any such transactions
(including any incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock and the use of proceeds
thereof, the incurrence of any Lien or the making of any Investment or any Restricted Payments) shall be deemed to
have occurred on the date the definitive agreement(s) is entered into and shall be deemed outstanding thereafter for
purposes of calculating any ratios or baskets under the indenture after the date of such definitive agreement(s) and
before the consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction, unless such definitive agreement(s) is terminated
or such Limited Condition Transaction or incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Equity Interests, Restricted Payment, Investment or incurrence of Liens or such other transaction to which pro forma
effect is being given does not occur.

For purposes of calculating any ratio-based basket, with respect to any revolving Indebtedness incurred under such
ratio-based basket, the Issuer may elect (which election may not be changed with respect to such Indebtedness), at
any time, to either (x) give pro forma effect to the incurrence of the entire committed amount of such Indebtedness,
in which case such committed amount may thereafter be borrowed or reborrowed, in whole or in part, from time to
time, without further compliance with any ratio-based component of any provision of the Indenture, or (y) give pro
_forma effect to the incurrence of the actual amount drawn under such revolving Indebtedness, in which case, the_
ability to incur the amounts committed to under such Indebtedness will be subject to such ratio-based basket (to the
extent being incurred pursuant to such ratio) at the time of each such Incurrence. To the extent clause (x) of the
immediately preceding sentence is elected, such revolving Indebtedness shall be deemed to be incurred (and the
fully committed amount of Indebtedness as outstanding) at all times thereafter for purposes of testing any ratiobased baskets, regardless of whether such Indebtedness is outstanding, until such commitments have been
permanently terminated in full.

Notwithstanding anything herein the contrary, unless the Issuer elects otherwise, if, on any date, the Issuer or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with any transaction or series of related transactions (A) utilizes a ratiobased basket under a covenant and (B) utilizes a non-ratio-based basket under the same covenant, then the
applicable ratio-based basket under such covenant will be calculated on such date with respect to any usage under
the applicable ratio-based basket under such covenant without giving effect to the usage under such non-ratio based
basket under the same such covenant made in connection with such transaction or series of related transactions.

**Suspension of Covenants**

During any period of time after the Issue Date that (i) the Notes are rated Investment Grade by both Rating Agencies
and (ii) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the indenture (the occurrence of the

187


-----

events described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being collectively referred to as a “Covenant Suspension
Event”), the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the covenants in the indenture specifically
listed under the following captions in this “Description of Notes” section of this offering memorandum (the
“Suspended Covenants”):

(1) “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(2) “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness”;

(3) “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales”;

(4) clause (d) of the first paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets”;

(5) “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates”;

(6) “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted
Subsidiaries;” and

(7) “—Certain Covenants—Additional Subsidiary Guarantees.”

Additionally, at such time as the above referenced covenants are suspended (a “Suspension Period”), we will no
longer be permitted to designate any Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary.

In the event that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants for any period
of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent date (the “Reversion Date”) one or both of the Rating
Agencies withdraw their Investment Grade rating or downgrade the rating assigned to the Notes below Investment
Grade, then the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants
with respect to future events.

On each Reversion Date, all Indebtedness incurred during the Suspension Period prior to such Reversion Date will
be deemed to be Existing Indebtedness. For purposes of calculating the amount available to be made as Restricted
Payments under clause (iii) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Restricted Payments,” calculations under such covenant shall be made as though such covenant had
been in effect during the entire period of time after the Issue Date (including the Suspension Period) Restricted
Payments made during the Suspension Period not otherwise permitted pursuant to any of clauses (2) through (12)
under the second paragraph under the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted
Payments” will reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under clause (iii) of the first
paragraph of such covenant, provided that the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments on the Reversion
Date shall not be reduced to below zero solely as a result of such Restricted Payments. For purposes of the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales,” on the Reversion Date, the unutilized amount
of Net Proceeds will be reset to zero. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither (a) the continued existence, after the
Reversion Date, of facts and circumstances or obligations that were incurred or otherwise came into existence during
a Suspension Period nor (b) the performance of any such obligations, shall constitute a breach of any covenant set
forth herein or cause a Default or Event of Default thereunder; provided that (1) the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries did not incur or otherwise cause such facts and circumstances or obligations to exist in anticipation of a
withdrawal or downgrade by the applicable Rating Agency below an Investment Grade rating and (2) the Issuer
reasonably believed that such incurrence or actions would not result in such withdrawal or downgrade. On each
Reversion Date, the Issuer shall be required to comply with the provisions under the covenant entitled “—Certain
covenants—Additional Subsidiary Guarantees” as if such covenant was in effect at all times during the Suspension
Period.

The Issuer shall provide an officers’ certificate to the Trustee indicating the occurrence of any Covenant Suspension
Event, Suspension Period or Reversion Date. The Trustee shall have no obligation to monitor the ratings of the
Notes, independently determine or verify if such events have occurred or notify the holders of Notes of any
Covenant Suspension Event, Suspension Period or Reversion Date. The Trustee may provide a copy of such
officers’ certificate to any holder of Notes upon request.

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade ratings.

**Events of Default**

The indenture provides that each of the following constitutes an “Event of Default”:

188


-----

(a) default for 30 days in the payment when due of interest or additional interest, if any, on the Notes;

(b) default in payment when due of principal of or premium, if any, on the Notes at maturity, upon repurchase,
redemption or otherwise;

(c) failure to comply for 30 days after notice with any obligations under the provisions described under “—
Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets,” “—Change of Control” or “—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales” (other than a failure to purchase Notes duly tendered to the Issuer for
repurchase pursuant to a Change of Control Offer or an Excess Proceeds Offer);

(d) subject to the penultimate paragraph of this “Events of default” section, default under any other provision of
the indenture, the Notes or the Collateral Documents, which default remains uncured for 60 days after notice
from the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% of the aggregate principal amount then outstanding of the
Notes;

(e) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may
be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed (or commitments in respect of Indebtedness
for borrowed money) by us and any of our Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is guaranteed by
us and any of our Restricted Subsidiaries), which default is caused by a failure to pay the principal of such
Indebtedness at the final stated maturity thereof within the grace period provided in such Indebtedness (a
“Payment Default”), and the principal amount of any such Indebtedness (including the principal amount of
commitments in respect of such Indebtedness), together with the principal amount of any other such
Indebtedness (including the principal amount of commitments in respect of such Indebtedness) under which
there has been a Payment Default, aggregates $40 million or more;

(f) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may
be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed (or commitments in respect of Indebtedness
for borrowed money) by us and any of our Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is guaranteed by
us or any of our Restricted Subsidiaries), which default results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness (or
termination of related commitments) prior to its express maturity not rescinded or cured within 30 days after
such acceleration (or termination of related commitments), and the principal amount of any such Indebtedness
(including the principal amount of commitments in respect of such Indebtedness), together with the principal
amount of any other such Indebtedness (including the principal amount of commitments in respect of such
Indebtedness) under which there has been a Payment Default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated
(or commitments terminated) and remains undischarged after such 30 day period, aggregates $40 million or
more;

(g) failure by us and any of our Restricted Subsidiaries to pay final judgments (other than any judgment as to
which a reputable insurance company has accepted full liability) aggregating $40 million or more, which
judgments are not stayed within 60 days after their entry;

(h) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (or a group
of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together, as of the last Measurement Period, would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary) of the Issuer (including the filing of a voluntary case, the consent to an order of relief
in an involuntary case, the consent to the appointment of a custodian, receiver or interim receiver, a general
assignment for the benefit of creditors or an order of a court for relief in an involuntary case, appointing a
custodian, trustee, receiver or interim receiver or ordering liquidation, which order remains unstayed for 60
days);

(i) any Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary (or a group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together, as of the
last Measurement Period, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) shall be held in a judicial proceeding to
be unenforceable or invalid or shall cease for any reason to be in full force and effect, or any Guarantor that
qualifies as a Significant Subsidiary (or a group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together, as of the last
Measurement Period, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary), or any Person acting on behalf of any
Guarantor that qualifies as a Significant Subsidiary (or a group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together,
as of the last Measurement Period, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary), shall deny or disaffirm its
obligations under its Guarantee;

(j) any Collateral Document after delivery thereof shall for any reason cease (or shall be asserted in writing by
the Issuer or any Guarantor to cease) to create a valid and perfected first priority Lien to the extent required by

189


-----

the Collateral Documents (subject to no other Liens other than Permitted Liens) on Collateral that is (i)
purported to be covered thereby and (ii) comprises Property which, when taken together with all Property as to
which such a Lien has so ceased to be effective, has a fair market value in excess of $40 million (other than
(x) in accordance with the terms of the Indenture or the terms of the Credit Facilities or the Security
Documents or (y) except to the extent that any such cessation of the Liens results from the failure of the
administrative agent under the Credit Facilities or the Applicable Authorized Representative, as the case may
be, in each case, as bailee for the Collateral Agent pursuant to the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agent,
to maintain possession of certificates actually delivered to it representing securities pledged under the Security
Documents); and

(h) failure by the Issuer to consummate the Special Mandatory Redemption as described under the caption “—
Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

If any Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee, by notice to the Issuer, or the holders of at least 25%
of the aggregate principal amount then outstanding of the Notes, by notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may declare
all the Notes to be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default
arising from the events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Issuer described in clause (h) above, all
outstanding Notes will become due and payable without further action or notice. Holders of the Notes may not
enforce the indenture or the Notes except as provided in the indenture. Subject to certain limitations, holders of a
majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or
power. The Trustee may withhold from holders of the Notes notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default
(except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of principal or interest) if it determines that
withholding notice is in such holders’ interest.

Subject to certain conditions, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount then outstanding of the Notes,
by written notice to the Trustee, may on behalf of the holders of all of the Notes waive any existing Default or Event
of Default and its consequences under the indenture, except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment
of interest or premium on, or principal of, the Notes.

However, a Default under clause (c), (d) or (g) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the
Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the Issuer of the Default
and, with respect to clauses (c) and (g), the Issuer does not cure such Default within the time specified in clause (c)
or (g) of this paragraph after the occurrence of such Default; provided that a notice of Default may not be given with
respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to holders, more than two years prior to such notice of Default.

Any failure to perform, or breach of, any covenant or agreement pursuant to “—Certain Covenants—Reports” shall
not be a Default or an Event of Default until the 121st day after we have received the notice referred to in clause (d)
of the first paragraph above (at which point, unless cured or waived, such failure to perform or breach shall
constitute an Event of Default). A failure to perform, or breach of any covenant or agreement pursuant to “—Certain
Covenants—Reports” shall automatically cease to be outstanding and shall be deemed cured at such time as we
furnish or file the applicable information or report.

We will be required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the indenture.

**No personal liability of directors, owners, employees, incorporators and stockholders**

No director, owner, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of us or any of our Affiliates, as such, shall have
any liability for any obligations of us or any of our Affiliates under the Notes, the Guarantees, the indenture, the
First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, any Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement, if applicable, or any Collateral
Document or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each holder of
Notes by accepting a note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration
for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws and
it is the view of the Commission that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

The indenture provides that with respect to the Notes, we may, at our option and at any time, elect to have all
obligations discharged with respect to the outstanding Notes, have each Guarantor’s obligation discharged with
respect to its Guarantee and have the Liens securing the outstanding Notes under the Collateral automatically

190


-----

terminated and released (“Legal Defeasance”). Such Legal Defeasance means that we will be deemed to have paid
and discharged the entire indebtedness, and satisfied all obligations and covenants under the indenture, except for:

(a) the rights of holders of outstanding Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if any,
and interest on the Notes when such payments are due, or on the redemption date, as the case may be;

(b) our obligations with respect to the Notes concerning issuing temporary Notes, registration of Notes, mutilated,
destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security
payments held in trust;

(c) the rights, powers, trust, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and our obligations in connection therewith;
and

(d) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the indenture.

In addition, the indenture provides that with respect to the Notes, we may, at our option and at any time, elect to
have all obligations released with respect to substantially all of the restrictive covenants that are described in the
indenture, including, without limitation, under “—Change of control” and have the Liens securing the outstanding
Notes automatically terminated and released (“Covenant Defeasance”) and thereafter any omission to comply with
such obligations shall not constitute a Default or Event of Default with respect to the Notes. If Covenant Defeasance
occurs, certain events (not including nonpayment, bankruptcy, receivership, rehabilitation and insolvency events)
described under “—Events of default” will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Notes.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance, the indenture provides that with respect to the
Notes:

(i) we must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the holders of the Notes, cash in U.S.
dollars, non-callable U.S. government obligations, or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be
sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants, to pay the
principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the outstanding Notes on the stated maturity or on the applicable
optional redemption date, as the case may be;

(ii) in the case of Legal Defeasance, we shall have delivered to the Trustee an opinion of counsel in the United
States confirming that:

(A) we have received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling or

(B) since the Issue Date, there has been a change in the applicable federal income tax law,

in each case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion of counsel shall confirm that, the beneficial
owners of the Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of
such Legal Defeasance, and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax in the same amount, in the same manner
and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(iii) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, we shall have delivered to the Trustee an opinion of counsel confirming
that the beneficial owners of the Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax
purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same
amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance
had not occurred;

(iv) in the case of Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance, we shall have delivered to the Trustee an opinion of
counsel or an advance tax ruling from the Canada Revenue Agency (or successor agency), in each case to the
effect that the holders and beneficial owners of the Notes will not recognize income, gain, or loss for Canadian
federal, provincial or territorial income or other tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance or Covenant
Defeasance, as the case may be, and will be subject to Canadian federal, provincial or territorial income or
other tax on the same amounts, in the same manner, and at the same times as would have been the case if such
Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance, as the case may be, had not occurred;

(v) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit;

(vi) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a
default under, the indenture or any other material agreement or instrument to which we or any of our
Subsidiaries is a party or by which we or any of our Subsidiaries is bound;

191


-----

(vii) we shall have delivered to the Trustee an officers’ certificate stating that the deposit was not made by us with
the intent of preferring the holders of the Notes over any of our other creditors or with the intent of defeating,
hindering, delaying or defrauding any of its other creditors or others; and

(viii) we shall have delivered to the Trustee an officers’ certificate and opinion of counsel stating that all conditions
precedent provided for or relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance relating to the Notes
have been complied with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The indenture, the Notes and the Collateral Documents will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect
(except as to surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of the Notes and the rights, powers, trust, duties
and immunities of the Trustee and the Collateral Agent, and our obligations in connection therewith, as expressly
provided for in the indenture) as to all outstanding Notes, and the Liens securing the Notes then outstanding will be
released, when:

(1) either:

(a) all the Notes, theretofore authenticated and delivered (except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes which have
been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust or
segregated and held in trust by the Issuer and thereafter repaid to the Issuer or discharged from such
trust) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or

(b) all Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and payable or,
within one year will become due and payable or subject to redemption as set forth above under the
heading “—Optional Redemption” and the Issuer has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited
with the Trustee funds in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Notes
not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal of, premium, if any, and interest
on the Notes to the date of deposit together with irrevocable instructions from the Issuer directing the
Trustee to apply such funds to the payment thereof at maturity or redemption, as the case may be;

(2) the Issuer has paid all other sums payable under the indenture by the Issuer; and

(3) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an officers’ certificate and an opinion of counsel stating that all
conditions precedent under the indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the indenture have been
complied with; provided, however, that such counsel may rely, as to matters of fact, on a certificate or
certificates of officers of the Issuer.

**Amendment, Supplement and Waiver**

Except as provided in the next paragraph, the indenture, the Notes, the Guarantees, the Escrow Agreement, the
Collateral Documents, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and any Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement may be
amended or supplemented with the written consent of the holders of at least a majority of the aggregate principal
amount of Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with an exchange offer or tender offer
for the Notes), and any existing Default and its consequences or compliance with any provision of the indenture, the
Notes, the Escrow Agreement, any Collateral Document, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement or any Junior Lien
Intercreditor Agreement may be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority of the aggregate principal
amount of Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with an exchange offer or tender offer
for the Notes).

Without the consent of each holder affected, however, an amendment or waiver may not (with respect to any Note
held by a non-consenting holder):

(a) reduce the aggregate principal amount of Notes whose holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or
waiver;

(b) reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any note or alter the provisions with respect to the
redemption of the Notes (other than as provided in clause (h) below);

(c) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any Notes;

192


-----

(d) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the Notes
(except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);

(e) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Notes;

(f) make any change in the provisions of the indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or the rights of holders
of Notes to receive payments of principal of or interest on the Notes;

(g) waive a redemption payment or mandatory redemption with respect to any Note (other than as provided in
clause (h) below);

(h) amend, change or modify in any material respect the obligation of the Issuer to make and consummate a
Change of Control Offer in the event of a Change of Control after such Change of Control has occurred;

(i) release all or substantially all of the Guarantees of the Guarantors other than in accordance with “—
Guarantees” above;

(j) make any change in the foregoing amendment and waiver provisions;

(k) impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to the Notes or the
Guarantees; or

(l) subordinate the payment of the Notes or Guarantees to any other obligation of the Issuers or the Guarantors.

Without the consent of holders of at least 66 2/3% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, no
amendment or waiver may (i) release all or substantially all of the Collateral from the Liens securing the Notes
Obligations created by the Collateral Documents, (ii) change or alter the priority of the Liens securing the Notes
Obligations created by the Collateral Documents in any manner adverse to the holders of the Notes or (iii) make any
change in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement or in the provisions of the
Indenture or any Collateral Document dealing with the application of proceeds of the Collateral that would
materially adversely affect the Holders or alter the priority of the security interests in the Collateral.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any holder of Notes, the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee
and the Collateral Agent may amend or supplement the indenture, the Notes, the Escrow Agreement, or the
Guarantees, or enter into, amend or supplement any Collateral Document, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement or
any Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement (i) to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency (as determined by the
Issuer in good faith), (ii) to provide for uncertificated Notes or Guarantees in addition to or in place of certificated
Notes or Guarantees (provided that the uncertificated notes are issued in registered form for purposes of
Section 163(f) of the Code, or in a manner such that the uncertificated notes are described in Section 163(f)(2)(B) of
the Code), (iii) to provide for the assumption of the obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor to holders of the
Notes in the case of a merger, amalgamation, arrangement, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our
assets or such Guarantor’s assets in accordance with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger,
Consolidation or Sale of Assets”, (iv) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the
holders of Notes or that does not adversely affect the rights under the indenture of any such holder in any material
respect, (v) to provide for the issuance of additional Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth in the
indenture, (vi) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of an appointment of a successor trustee or successor
collateral agent, (vii) to comply with the rules of any applicable securities, depository, (viii) to add Guarantees with
respect to the Notes, (ix) to add Collateral with respect to the Notes and the Guarantees, (x) to conform the
indenture, the Notes, the Escrow Agreement, the Guarantees, the Collateral Documents and the First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement to this “Description of Notes,” (xi) to release Collateral from the Liens securing the Notes
and the Guarantees when permitted or required by the Collateral Documents, the indenture, the First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement or any Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement, (xii) to enter into any intercreditor agreement
having substantially similar terms with respect to the holders of the Notes as those set forth in the First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement, or any joinder thereto, or to enter into any Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement in
connection with the incurrence of any Future First Lien Obligations or Junior Lien Obligations not otherwise
prohibited by the indenture or (xiii) with respect to the Collateral Documents and the First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement, as provided in the relevant Collateral Document or First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

Our obligations in respect of Change of Control Offer can be modified with the consent of the holders of a majority
in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding at any time prior to the occurrence of a Change of

193


-----

Control. The consent of the noteholders is not necessary under the indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment.

**Divisions**

For all purposes under this “Description of Notes”, the indenture, the Collateral Documents and the First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement, in connection with any division or plan of division under Delaware law (or any comparable
event under a different jurisdiction’s laws): (a) if any asset, right, obligation or liability of any Person becomes the
asset, right, obligation or liability of a different Person, then it shall be deemed to have been transferred from the
original Person to the subsequent Person and (b) if any new Person comes into existence, such new Person shall be
deemed to have been organized on the first date of its existence by the holder of its Equity Interests at such time.

**Concerning the Trustee and the Collateral Agent**

The indenture contains certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee and the Collateral Agent, if the Trustee or the
Collateral Agent becomes a creditor of us or our Subsidiaries, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to
realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee and the
Collateral Agent will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the Issuer and its Subsidiaries; provided,
however, if the Trustee or the Collateral Agent acquires any conflicting interest, it must eliminate such conflict
within 90 days, apply to the Commission for permission to continue as Trustee or Collateral Agent or resign.

With respect to the Notes, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes will have the
right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the
Trustee or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, subject to certain exceptions. The indenture provides that in case an
Event of Default shall occur (which has not been cured), the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to
use the degree of care of a prudent person in the conduct of his or her own affairs. Subject to such provisions,
neither the Trustee nor the Collateral Agent will be relieved from liabilities for its own negligent action, its own
negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct, except that:

(i) this sentence shall not limit the preceding sentence of this paragraph;

(ii) it shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith, unless it is proved that it was negligent in
ascertaining the pertinent facts; and

(iii) it shall not be liable with respect to any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in accordance with a

such interest is covered by agreements relating to Hedging Obligations, shall be deemed to accrue at the rate
per annum resulting after giving effect to the operation of such agreements.

Preferred Equity Interests, any required dividends or other distributions on account of such Preferred Equity
Interests shall be deemed to be Consolidated Fixed Charges of such Person during the applicable Measurement
Period.

portion of interest expense resulting from the reduction in the carrying value under purchase accounting of
outstanding Indebtedness; provided that, for purposes of calculating consolidated interest expense, no effect will be
given to the discount and/or premium resulting from accounting for derivatives in accordance with US GAAP as a
result of the terms of the Indebtedness to which such consolidated interest expense applies; provided, further, that
with respect to the calculation of the consolidated interest expense of the Issuer, (A) commissions, discounts, yield,
and other fees and charges (including any interest expense) related to any Receivables Facility and (B) the interest
expense of Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any Person that is not a Subsidiary shall, in each case, be excluded.

Company, or DTC, and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC.

Ownership of beneficial interests in each global note will be limited to persons who have accounts with DTC, which
are called DTC participants, or persons who hold interests through DTC participants.

We expect that under procedures established by DTC:

    - upon deposit of each global note with DTC’s custodian, DTC will credit portions of the principal
amount of the global note to the accounts of the DTC participants designated by the initial purchasers;
and

    - ownership of beneficial interests in each global note will be shown on, and transfer of ownership of
those interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to interests of
DTC participants) and the records of DTC participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial
interests in the global note).

Beneficial interests in the global Notes may not be exchanged for Notes in physical, certificated form except in the
limited circumstances described below. Each global note and beneficial interests in each global note will be subject
to restrictions on transfer as described under “Important Information for Investors.”

**Exchanges among the Global Notes**

The distribution compliance period under Regulation S of the Securities Act will begin on the closing date and end
40 days after the closing date.

Beneficial interests in one global note may generally be exchanged for interests in another global note if in a
transaction in compliance with the securities laws applicable to such global note. Depending on whether the transfer
is being made during or after the distribution compliance period, and to which global note the transfer is being made,
the Trustee may require the seller to provide certain written certifications in the form provided in the indenture.

A beneficial interest in a global note that is transferred to a person who takes delivery through another global note
will, upon transfer, become subject to any transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial interests
in the other global note.

**Book-entry Procedures or the Global Notes**

All interests in the global Notes will be subject to the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear Bank S.A./ N.V.
and Clearstream Banking S.A. We provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for
the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that
settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither we nor the initial purchasers are responsible for those
operations or procedures.

218


-----

DTC has advised us that it is:

    - a limited purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York;

    - a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York State Banking Law;

    - a member of the Federal Reserve System;

    - a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code; and

    - a “clearing agency” registered under Section 17A of the Exchange Act.

DTC was created to hold securities for its participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities
transactions between its participants through electronic book-entry changes to the accounts of its participants.
DTC’s participants include securities brokers and dealers, including the initial purchasers; banks and trust
companies; clearing corporations and other organizations. Indirect access to DTC’s system is also available to
others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies; these indirect participants clear through or maintain a
custodial relationship with a DTC participant, either directly or indirectly. Investors who are not DTC participants
may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through DTC participants or indirect participants
in DTC.

So long as DTC’s nominee is the registered owner of a global note, that nominee will be considered the sole owner
or holder of the Notes represented by that global note for all purposes under the indenture. Except as provided
below, owners of beneficial interests in a global note:

    - will not be entitled to have Notes represented by the global note registered in their names;

    - will not receive or be entitled to receive physical, certificated Notes; and

    - will not be considered the owners or holders of the Notes under the indenture for any purpose,
including with respect to the giving of any direction, instruction or approval to the Trustee under the
indenture.

As a result, each investor who owns a beneficial interest in a global note must rely on the procedures of DTC to
exercise any rights of a holder of Notes under the indenture (and, if the investor is not a participant or an indirect
participant in DTC, on the procedures of the DTC participant through which the investor owns its interest).

Payments of principal, premium (if any) and interest with respect to the Notes represented by a global note will be
made by the Trustee or the paying agent to DTC’s nominee as the registered holder of the global note. Neither we
nor the Trustee nor any paying agent will have any responsibility or liability for the payment of amounts to owners
of beneficial interests in a global note, for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of
those interests by DTC, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records of DTC relating to those interests.

Payments by participants and indirect participants in DTC to the owners of beneficial interests in a global note will
be governed by standing instructions and customary industry practice and will be the responsibility of those
participants or indirect participants and DTC.

Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected under DTC’s procedures and will be settled in same-day
funds. Transfers between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way under the
rules and operating procedures of those systems.

Cross-market transfers between DTC participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on
the other hand, will be effected within DTC through the DTC participants that are acting as depositaries for
Euroclear and Clearstream. To deliver or receive an interest in a global note held in a Euroclear or Clearstream
account, an investor must send transfer instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, under the rules
and procedures of that system and within the established deadlines of that system. If the transaction meets its
settlement requirements, Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will send instructions to its DTC depositary

219


-----

to take action to effect final settlement by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant global Notes in DTC, and
making or receiving payment under normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear
and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the DTC depositaries that are acting for
Euroclear or Clearstream.

Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant that purchases an
interest in a global note from a DTC participant will be credited on the business day for Euroclear or Clearstream
immediately following the DTC settlement date. Cash received in Euroclear or Clearstream from the sale of an
interest in a global note to a DTC participant will be received with value on the DTC settlement date but will be
available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account as of the business day for Euroclear or Clearstream
following the DTC settlement date.

DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the above procedures to facilitate transfers of interests in the global
Notes among participants in those settlement systems. However, the settlement systems are not obligated to perform
these procedures and may discontinue or change these procedures at any time. Neither we nor the Trustee will have
any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their participants or indirect participants
of their obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Certificated Notes**

Notes in physical, certificated form will be issued and delivered to each person that DTC identifies as a beneficial
owner of the related Notes only if:

    - DTC notifies us at any time that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the global Notes
and a successor depositary is not appointed within 90 days;

    - DTC ceases to be registered as a clearing agency under the Exchange Act and a successor depositary is
not appointed within 90 days;

    - we, at our option, notify the Trustee that we elect to cause the issuance of certificated Notes; or

    - certain other events provided in the indenture should occur.

**CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following discussion is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership
and disposition of the Notes by U.S. holders (as defined below), but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all
potential U.S. federal income tax effects. This discussion does not address prospective investors that are non-U.S.
persons, except for the discussion on FATCA (as defined below under “—Foreign Account tax Compliance Act”).
Such investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of an investment in the Notes. This
summary does not address the effects of any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws (such as
estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. This discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury regulations issued thereunder, and judicial and administrative
interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change or differing
interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. No rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) have
been or are expected to be sought with respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the
IRS will not take a different position concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase,
ownership or disposition of the Notes or that any such position would not be sustained.

This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a holder in
light of such holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the unearned income Medicare contribution
tax, or to holders subject to special rules, such as financial institutions, U.S. expatriates, insurance companies,
dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities, U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar,
tax exempt entities, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships or other pass through
entities or arrangements and investors in such entities or arrangements, persons subject to special tax accounting
rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the Notes being taken into account in an applicable
financial statement, persons liable for alternative minimum tax, U.S. holders that hold Notes through non-U.S.
brokers or other non-U.S. intermediaries and persons holding the Notes as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion
transaction” or other integrated transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, this discussion is
limited to U.S. holders who purchase the Notes in this offering at the price set forth on the cover page of this
offering memorandum and who hold the Notes as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code
(generally, property held for investment).

If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the U.S.
federal income tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner and
the activities of the partner and the partnership. A partnership considering an investment in the Notes, and partners
in such a partnership, should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes.

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation organized under the
laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) any estate the income of which is
subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) any trust if a court within the United States is
able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more “United States persons”
(within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the
trust, or if a valid election is in place to treat the trust as a United States person.

**Prospective investors in the Notes should consult their tax advisors concerning the tax consequences of**
**holding Notes in light of their particular circumstances, including the application of the U.S. federal income**
**tax considerations discussed below, as well as the application of other U.S. federal tax laws (such as estate and**
**gift tax laws) and state, local, non-U.S. or other tax laws.**

**Transactions Related to the Acquisition**

If this offering is consummated prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, upon the consummation of the
Acquisition, the Escrow Issuer will liquidate into Akumin Inc. and, on the liquidation, Akumin Inc. will assume the
obligations of the Escrow Issuer under the Indenture and the Notes (the “Assumption”). See “Description of Notes.”
We believe, and intend to take the position (to the extent we are required to do so), that the Assumption should not
result in a significant modification of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. It is possible, however, that
the IRS could assert a contrary view and seek to treat the Assumption as resulting in a deemed exchange of the

221


-----

Notes for “new notes”. Under such view, the Notes could be treated as having been issued with “original issue
discount” for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, holders subject to U.S. federal income taxation
generally could recognize gain in connection with such deemed exchange (although any loss could be disallowed)
and have a new holding period and new tax basis in the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Holders should
consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences to them of the Assumption. The
remainder of the discussion below assumes that the Assumption, if it occurs, will not be treated as resulting in a
deemed exchange for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**Effect of Certain Contingencies**

In certain circumstances, we may be obligated to make payments on the Notes in excess of stated principal and
interest, or to make payments in advance of their scheduled due dates (see, e.g., “Description of Notes—Additional
_Amounts” and “Description of Notes—Change of Control”). We intend to take the position that the foregoing_
contingencies should not cause the Notes to be treated as contingent payment debt instruments. This position is
based, in part, on assumptions regarding the likelihood of such contingencies as of the date of issuance of the Notes.
Our position is binding on a holder unless the holder discloses in the proper manner to the IRS that it is taking a
different position. If the IRS successfully challenged our position, and the Notes were treated as contingent payment
debt instruments, a U.S. holder could be required to accrue interest income at a rate higher than the stated interest
rate and to treat as ordinary income, rather than capital gain, any gain recognized on a sale, exchange, retirement or
redemption of a Note. This disclosure assumes that the Notes will not be considered contingent payment debt
instruments. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the potential application of the
contingent payment debt instrument rules to the Notes and the consequences thereof.

**Stated Interest**

Stated interest on the Notes (including any additional amounts paid in respect of non-U.S. withholding taxes and
without reduction for any such tax withheld) generally will be includible in the gross income of a U.S. holder as
ordinary income at the time that the stated interest is received or accrued, in accordance with such U.S. holder’s
regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**Foreign Tax Credit**

A U.S. holder may be able to claim a credit (or, at such holder’s election, a deduction in lieu of such credit) with
respect to any non-U.S. withholding taxes deducted from a payment on the Notes in computing such holder’s U.S.
federal income tax liability. Stated interest income on a Note generally will constitute foreign source income and
generally will be considered “passive category income” in computing the foreign tax credit. However, as discussed
under “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes,” the IRS could argue that interest on the Notes is treated as U.S.
source. There are significant complex limitations on a U.S. holder’s ability to claim foreign tax credits. U.S. holders
should consult their tax advisors regarding the creditability or deductibility of any withholding taxes.

**Sale, Exchange, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes**

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder generally will
recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized upon such disposition (less any
amount equal to any accrued but unpaid stated interest which will be taxable as stated interest income as discussed
above in “—Stated Interest”) and such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note. A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax
basis in a Note generally will be the purchase price of such Note paid by such U.S. holder. Any gain or loss
recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note generally will be
U.S. source capital gain or loss (for foreign tax credit purposes) and generally will be long-term capital gain or loss
if the U.S. holder held the Note for more than one year on the date of disposition. Long-term capital gains of
non-corporate U.S. holders (including individuals) are generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The
deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

**Information Reporting and Backup Withholding**

In general, payments of stated interest on the Notes and the proceeds of the sale or other disposition (including a
retirement or redemption) of a Note paid to a U.S. holder may be required to be reported to the IRS unless the U.S.

222


-----

holder properly establishes that it is a corporation or other exempt recipient. Backup withholding may apply to such
payments if the U.S. holder fails to provide the applicable withholding agent with a taxpayer identification number
or a certification that it is not subject to backup withholding. U.S. holders may be required to provide such
certification on IRS Form W-9.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be
allowed as a refund or a credit against a U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability provided the required
information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**Tax Return Disclosure Requirements**

Individuals (and certain entities treated as individuals for this purpose) that own “specified foreign financial assets”
(which includes debt of foreign entities) with an aggregate value in excess of certain thresholds generally are
required to file an information report on IRS Form 8938 with respect to such assets with their tax returns. If a U.S.
holder does not file a required IRS Form 8938, such holder may be subject to substantial penalties and the statute of
limitations on the assessment and collection of all U.S. federal income taxes of such holder for the related tax year
may not close before the date which is three years after the date on which such report is filed. The Notes may
constitute specified foreign financial assets subject to these reporting requirements unless the Notes are held in an
account at certain financial institutions. Under certain circumstances, an entity may be treated as an individual for
purposes of these rules.

U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing disclosure requirements to
their ownership of the Notes, including the significant penalties for noncompliance.

**Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act**

Subject to the proposed regulations discussed below, pursuant to Section 1471 to 1474 of the Code and Treasury
regulations promulgated thereunder (provisions commonly referred to as “FATCA”), a “foreign financial
institution” may be required to withhold U.S. tax on certain payments treated as attributable to certain U.S. source
payments (so-called “foreign passthru payments”). Currently, the term “foreign passthru payment” is not defined
and it is unclear whether or to what extent payments on the Notes would be considered foreign passthru payments,
assuming the Issuer were treated as a foreign financial institution. If and when final Treasury regulations are
published defining such term, the Notes will be considered “grandfathered” from FATCA because they were issued
on or prior to the date that is six months after the date on which such final Treasury regulations are published, unless
the Notes are materially modified after such date. Under proposed Treasury regulations, any FATCA withholding on
foreign passthru payments on debt instruments that are not otherwise grandfathered would only apply to foreign
passthru payments made on or after the date that is two years after the date on which final Treasury regulations are
published in the Federal Register defining foreign passthru payments. Taxpayers generally may rely on these
proposed Treasury regulations until final Treasury regulations are issued.

Even if the Notes are not deemed to give rise to any foreign passthru payments, FATCA withholding could apply if
interest on the Notes were treated as U.S. source. As discussed above under “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
_Notes,” we believe that the interest on the Notes should be treated as foreign source._

Canada has entered into an intergovernmental agreement with the United States to implement FATCA in a manner
that may alter the rules described herein. Under the intergovernmental agreement, the Issuer may be required to
report certain information regarding investors to taxing authorities in Canada, which information may be shared with
taxing authorities in the United States.

Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors on how FATCA may apply to their investment in the
Notes.

In the event any FATCA withholding is imposed with respect to any payments on the Notes, there will be no
Additional Amounts payable to compensate for the withheld amount.

**CERTAIN CANADIAN FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following summary describes the material Canadian federal income tax considerations pursuant to the Income
Tax Act (Canada) and the Income Tax Regulations (collectively, the “Tax Act”) generally applicable to a holder that
acquires as beneficial owner the Notes pursuant to this offering, and beneficially owns all payments thereunder, and
that, for purposes of the Tax Act and all relevant times, holds the Notes as capital property, deals at arm’s length
with Akumin Inc., the Escrow Issuer, the Guarantors and each of the initial purchasers, and is not affiliated with
Akumin Inc., the Escrow Issuer, the Guarantors or any of the initial purchasers (a “Holder”). Generally, the Notes
will be considered to be capital property to a Holder provided the Holder does not hold the Notes in the course of
carrying on a business of trading or dealing in securities and has not acquired them in one or more transactions
considered to be an adventure or concern in the nature of trade.

This summary is based upon the facts set out in this offering memorandum, the provisions of the Tax Act in force as
of the date hereof, all specific proposals to amend the Tax Act that have been publicly announced by or on behalf of
the Minister of Finance (Canada) prior to the date hereof (the “Proposed Amendments”) and our understanding of
the current administrative policies and assessing practices of the Canada Revenue Agency (“CRA”) made publicly
available prior to the date hereof. This summary assumes the Proposed Amendments will be enacted in the form
proposed. However, no assurance can be given that the Proposed Amendments will be enacted in the form proposed,
if at all. This summary is not exhaustive of all possible Canadian federal income tax considerations and, except for
the Proposed Amendments, does not take into account any changes in the law, or administrative policy or assessing
practice, whether by legislative, administrative, governmental or judicial action or decision, nor does it take into
account provincial, territorial or foreign income tax considerations, which may differ significantly from those
discussed herein.

**This summary is of a general nature only and is not intended to be, nor should it be construed to be, legal or**
**tax advice to any particular Holder or prospective Holder, and no representations with respect to the income**
**tax consequences to any Holder or prospective Holder are made. Consequently, Holders and prospective**
**Holders should consult their own tax advisors for advice with respect to the tax consequences to them of**
**acquiring Notes pursuant to this offering, having regard to their particular circumstances.**

**Currency Conversion**

Generally, all amounts relating to the acquisition, holding or disposition of the Notes, including adjusted cost base,
proceeds of disposition, and payments of interest must be converted into Canadian dollars for the purposes of the
Tax Act based on the rate as quoted by the Bank of Canada for the applicable day or such other rate of exchange that
is acceptable to the Minister of National Revenue (Canada). The amount of interest or capital gain or capital loss of
a Holder may therefore be affected by fluctuations in the Canadian/U.S. dollar exchange rate.

**Residents of Canada**

The following portion of the summary is applicable to a Holder that, at all relevant times and for the purposes of the
Tax Act and any applicable income tax treaty or convention is or is deemed to be resident in Canada (a “Resident
Holder”). Certain Resident Holders that might not otherwise be considered to hold their Notes as capital property
may, in certain circumstances, be entitled to have their Notes and all other “Canadian securities” (as defined in the
Tax Act) owned in the taxation year of the election and all subsequent taxation years deemed to be capital property
by making the irrevocable election permitted by subsection 39(4) of the Tax Act. Such Holders should consult their
own tax advisors for advice with respect to whether an election under subsection 39(4) of the Tax Act is available or
advisable having regard to their particular circumstances. The following portion of this summary is not applicable to
(i) a Holder that is a “financial institution”, as defined in the Tax Act for the purposes of the mark-to-market rules,
(ii) a Holder an interest in which would be a “tax shelter investment” as defined in the Tax Act, (iii) a Holder that is
a “specified financial institution” as defined in the Tax Act, (iv) a Holder that makes or has made a functional
currency reporting election pursuant to section 261 of the Tax Act to report its “Canadian tax results” as defined in
the Tax Act in a currency other than Canadian currency or (v) a holder that has entered or will enter into a
“derivative forward agreement” as defined in the Tax Act in respect of the Notes. Any such Holder should consult
its own tax advisor with respect to an investment in the Notes.

224


-----

_Interest on the Notes_

A Resident Holder of Notes that is a corporation, partnership, unit trust or any trust of which a corporation or a
partnership is a beneficiary will be required to include in computing its income for a taxation year any interest on the
Notes that accrues or is deemed to accrue to the Resident Holder to the end of the particular taxation year or that has
become receivable by, or is received by, the Resident Holder before the end of that taxation year, except to the
extent that such interest was included in computing the Resident Holder’s income for a preceding taxation year.

Any other Resident Holder, including an individual, will be required to include in computing its income for a
taxation year all interest on the Notes that is received or receivable by the Holder in that taxation year (depending
upon the method regularly followed by the Resident Holder in computing income), except to the extent that the
interest was included in the Resident Holder’s income for a preceding taxation year. In addition, if in any taxation
year a note should become an “investment contract” (as defined in the Tax Act) on any “anniversary day” (as
defined in the Tax Act) in relation to a Resident Holder (other than a corporation, partnership, unit trust or any trust
of which a corporation or a partnership is a beneficiary), such Resident Holder will be required to include in
computing income for the taxation year any interest that accrues or is deemed to accrue to the Resident Holder on
the Notes up to the end of such anniversary day, to the extent such interest was not otherwise included in the
Resident Holder’s income for that year or a preceding year.

A Resident Holder of Notes that throughout the relevant taxation year is a “Canadian-controlled private corporation”
(as defined in the Tax Act) may be liable to pay a refundable tax on its “aggregate investment income”, which is
defined in the Tax Act to include interest income.

_Akumin Inc. Assumption_

If this offering is consummated prior to the Acquisition, upon the consummation of the Acquisition, the Escrow
Issuer will liquidate into Akumin Inc. and, on the liquidation, Akumin Inc. will assume the obligations of Escrow
Issuer under the Indenture and the Notes (for purposes of the disclosure under the heading “Certain Canadian
Federal Income Tax Considerations”, the “Assumption”). The Assumption may give rise to a disposition of the
Notes by a Resident Noteholder for purposes of the Tax Act. Upon any disposition of a Note as a result of the
Assumption, a Resident Noteholder will be deemed to have disposed of the Notes for proceeds equal to the adjusted
cost base thereof to such Resident Noteholder immediately before the Assumption and to have reacquired such
Notes at a cost equal to the same amount. Accordingly, a Resident Noteholder will not realize any gain or loss as a
result of any disposition of a Note on the Assumption. A Resident Noteholder should consult their own tax advisor
in this regard.

_Redemption, Repayment or Disposition of Notes_

If the Notes are redeemed prior to maturity or are repaid upon maturity, a Resident Holder will be considered to
have disposed of the Notes for proceeds of disposition equal to the amount received by the Resident Holder (other
than the amount received on account of interest) on such redemption or repayment. The Resident Holder may realize
a capital gain or capital loss as described below.

Any amount paid by Akumin Inc. or the Escrow Issuer as a penalty or bonus because of early repayment of all or
part of the principal amount of the Notes will be deemed to be received by the Resident Holder as interest on the
Notes and will be required to be included in the Resident Holder’s income as described above, to the extent such
amount can reasonably be considered to relate to, and does not exceed the value at the time of payment of, interest
that would otherwise have been payable on the Notes for a taxation year of Akumin Inc. or the Escrow Issuer (as
applicable) ending after the payment of such amount.

In addition, on a disposition or a deemed disposition of the Notes, including repayment or purchase by Akumin Inc.
or the Escrow Issuer, a Resident Holder will generally be required to include in income the amount of interest
accrued or deemed to accrue to the date of disposition, to the extent that such amounts have not otherwise been
included in the Resident Holder’s income for the year or a preceding taxation year.

In general, a disposition or a deemed disposition of Notes by a Resident Holder (excluding any disposition of a
Note on the Assumption) will give rise to a capital gain (or a capital loss) equal to the amount by which the proceeds

225


-----

of disposition, net of any amount included in computing the Resident Holder’s income as interest and any
reasonable costs of disposition, exceed (or are exceeded by) the adjusted cost base of the Notes to the Resident
Holder immediately before the disposition.

Generally, one-half of any capital gain (a “taxable capital gain”) realized by a Resident Holder in a taxation year
must be included in the Resident Holder’s income for the year, and one-half of any capital loss (an “allowable
capital loss”) realized by a Resident Holder in a taxation year must be deducted from taxable capital gains realized
by the Resident Holder in that year. Allowable capital losses for a taxation year in excess of taxable capital gains
realized in a taxation year generally may be carried back and deducted in any of the three preceding taxation years
or carried forward and deducted in any subsequent taxation year against net taxable capital gains realized in such
years, to the extent and under the circumstances described in the Tax Act.

A Resident Holder of Notes that throughout the relevant taxation year is a “Canadian controlled private corporation”
(as defined in the Tax Act) may be liable to pay a refundable tax on its “aggregate investment income”, which is
defined in the Tax Act to include taxable capital gains.

Individuals or trusts (other than certain trusts) may be subject to an alternative minimum tax under the Tax Act upon
realizing net taxable capital gains.

**Eligibility for Investment**

Provided that Akumin Inc.’s shares are listed on a “designated stock exchange” in Canada (which currently includes
the TSX) on the date of issue, the Notes offered hereby will be, on the date of issue, qualified investments under the
Tax Act for trusts governed by registered retirement savings plans (“RRSPs”), registered retirement income funds
(“RRIFs”), deferred profit sharing plans (“DPSPs”), registered education savings plans (“RESPs”), registered
disability savings plans (“RDSPs”) and tax-free savings accounts (“TFSAs”) (except that such Notes are not a
qualified investment for a trust governed by a DPSP for which any employer is Akumin Inc. or an employer with
whom Akumin Inc. or the Escrow Issuer does not deal at arm’s length within the meaning of the Tax Act).

Notwithstanding that the Notes may be a qualified investment for a trust governed by a TFSA, RRSP, RRIF, RESP
or RDSP, the holder of a TFSA or RDSP, the annuitant of a RRSP or RRIF or the subscriber of an RESP, as the case
may be, will be subject to a penalty tax in respect of the Notes if held in the TFSA, RRSP, RRIF, RESP or RDSP, as
applicable, if the Notes are a “prohibited investment” within the meaning of the Tax Act. The Notes will not be a
“prohibited investment” for trusts governed by a TFSA, RRSP, RRIF, RESP or RDSP provided the holder of such
TFSA or RDSP, the annuitant of such RRSP or RRIF or the subscriber of the RESP, as applicable, (i) deals at arm’s
length with Akumin Inc. and the Escrow Issuer for the purposes of the Tax Act, and (ii) does not have a “significant
interest” (as defined in the Tax Act) in Akumin Inc. Holders of TFSAs and RDSPs, annuitants of RRSPs and RRIFs
and subscribers of RESPs should consult their own tax advisors as to whether the Notes will be “prohibited
investments” in their particular circumstances.

**Non-Residents of Canada**

The following portion of the summary is applicable to a Holder that, at all relevant times and for purposes of the Tax
Act, (i) is not resident and not deemed to be resident in Canada (including as a consequence of an applicable income
tax treaty or convention), (ii) does not use or hold the Notes in carrying on business in Canada, (iii) deals at arm’s

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase and holding of the Notes by (a)
employee benefit plans that are subject to Title I of ERISA, (b) plans, individual retirement accounts and other
arrangements that are subject to Section 4975 of the Code or provisions under any other federal, state, local, nonU.S. or other laws or regulations that are similar to such provisions of ERISA or the Code (collectively, “Similar
Laws”), and (c) entities or accounts whose underlying assets are considered to include “plan assets” of any such
plan, account or arrangement described in clause (a) or (b) (each of the foregoing described in clauses (a) (b), and
(c) referred to as a “Plan”).

**General Fiduciary Matters**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to Title I of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code (an “ERISA Plan”) and prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan
and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any
discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition
of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such an
ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan.

Non-U.S. plans, U.S. governmental plans and certain U.S. church plans, while not subject to the fiduciary
responsibility provisions of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code
(as discussed below), may nevertheless be subject to Similar Laws. Fiduciaries of any such plans should consult
with their counsel before purchasing the Notes to determine the suitability of the Notes for such plan and the need
for, and the availability, if necessary, of any exemptive relief under any such laws or regulations.

In considering an investment in the Notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should determine
whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable
provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without
limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the
Code and any other applicable Similar Laws.

In addition, a fiduciary should consider the fact that none of the issuer, initial purchasers, or guarantors, or any of
their respective affiliates (collectively, the “Transaction Parties”), will act as a fiduciary to any Plan with respect to
the decision to purchase or hold Notes and none of the Transaction Parties is undertaking to provide any advice,
including, without limitation, in a fiduciary capacity, with respect to such decision. The decision to purchase and
hold the Notes must be made by each prospective Plan purchaser on an arms’ length basis.

**Prohibited Transaction Issues**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified transactions
involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of ERISA, or
“disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption is available. A party in
interest or disqualified person who engaged in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes
and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that
engaged in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and/or
the Code. The purchase and/or holding of Notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which a Transaction Party is
considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited
transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and held
in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the
U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions, or “PTCEs,” that may apply to the
purchase and holding of the Notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting
transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance
company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60
respecting life insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house
asset managers. Each of the above-noted exemptions contains conditions and limitations on its application.
Fiduciaries of ERISA Plans considering purchasing and/or holding the Notes in reliance of these or any other

231


-----

exemption should carefully review the exemption to assure it is applicable. There can be no assurance that all of the
conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied.

Because of the foregoing, the Notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing “plan assets” of any
Plan unless such purchase and holding will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA and the
Code or a violation of any applicable Similar Laws.

**Representation**

Accordingly, by acceptance of a note, each purchaser and subsequent transferee of a note (or any interest therein)
will be deemed to have represented and warranted that either (i) no portion of the assets used by such purchaser or
transferee to purchase or hold the Notes (or any interest therein) constitutes assets of any Plan or (ii) the purchase
and holding of the Notes by such purchaser or transferee will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction
under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a violation under any applicable Similar Laws, and
none of the Transaction Parties is acting as a fiduciary to such purchaser or transferee, nor undertaking to provide
any advice in a fiduciary or other capacity, with respect to the purchase or holding of the Notes (or of any interest in
the Notes).

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all inclusive. Due to the complexity of these
rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is
particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering purchasing the Notes on behalf of, or with the
assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the
Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase and
holding of the Notes.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Barclays Capital Inc. is acting as representative (the “representative”) of the several initial purchasers named below.
Subject to the terms and conditions stated in the purchase agreement dated the date of this offering memorandum,
each initial purchaser named below has severally agreed to purchase, and we have agreed to sell to that initial
purchaser, the principal amount of the Notes set forth opposite the initial purchaser’s name.

**Principal Amount of**

**Initial Purchaser** **Notes**

Barclays Capital Inc. ..................................................................................................... $

J.P. Morgan Securities LLC ..........................................................................................

Raymond James (USA) Ltd. .........................................................................................

SVB Leerink LLC .........................................................................................................

PNC Capital Markets LLC ............................................................................................

Regions Securities LLC ................................................................................................

$500,000,000
Total .......................................................................................................................

The purchase agreement provides that the obligations of the initial purchasers to purchase the Notes are subject to
customary closing conditions. The initial purchasers must purchase all the Notes if they purchase any of the Notes.
If an initial purchaser defaults, the purchase agreement provides that the purchase commitments of the nondefaulting initial purchasers may be increased or the purchase agreement may be terminated.

Prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, the Escrow Issuer has agreed to indemnify the initial purchasers
against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments the initial
purchasers may be required to make in respect of those liabilities. Following the consummation of the Acquisition,
the issuer and the guarantors will have jointly and severally agreed to indemnify the initial purchasers against certain
liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments the initial purchasers may be
required to make in respect of those liabilities.

The initial purchasers propose to resell the Notes at the offering price set forth on the cover page of this offering
memorandum to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers (as defined in Rule 144A) in
reliance on Rule 144A and outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S. See “Transfer Restrictions.” The
price at which the Notes are offered may be changed at any time without notice. The initial purchasers may offer and
sell Notes through certain of their affiliates. The initial purchasers reserve the right to reject, cancel or modify an
order of the Notes in whole or in part.

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and may not
be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (as defined in
Regulation S) except in transactions exempt from, or not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities
Act. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

In addition, with respect to the Notes initially sold outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S, until
40 days following the closing of this offering, an offer or sale of Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether
or not participating in this offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act unless the dealer
makes the offer or sale in compliance with Rule 144A or another exemption from registration under the Securities
Act.

We and the guarantors have agreed that during the period from the date of this offering memorandum through and
including the date that is 60 days following the date of this offering memorandum, we and the guarantors will not
without the prior written consent of the representative, directly or indirectly, offer for sale, sell, or otherwise dispose
of (or enter into any transaction or device that is designed to, or would be expected to, result in the disposition by
any person at any time in the future), or publicly announce the offering of, or file (or cause to be filed) any
registration statement under the Securities Act in respect of, any debt securities of the issuer or the guarantors
substantially similar to the Notes offered hereby or securities exchangeable for or convertible into such debt
securities of the issuer or the guarantors (other than as contemplated by the purchase agreement), or sell or grant
options, rights, or warrants with respect to such debt securities (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for
such debt securities) or enter into any swap or other derivatives transaction that transfers, in whole or in part, any of

233


-----

the economic benefits or risks of ownership of such debt securities. Such restriction does not prohibit or in any way
restrict the issuance of the Notes, the issuance of any Additional Notes of the same series in accordance with the
terms of the indenture, or the issuance of any Financing Notes to Stonepeak.

There is no established trading market for the Notes. We do not intend to list the Notes on any national securities
exchange. We cannot assure you that the prices at which the Notes will sell in the market after this offering will not
be lower than the initial offering price or that an active trading market for the Notes will develop and continue after
this offering. The initial purchasers have advised us that they currently intend to make a market in the Notes.
However, they are not obligated to do so and they may discontinue any market-making activities with respect to the
Notes at any time without notice. Accordingly, we cannot assure you as to the liquidity of, or the trading market for,
the Notes.

You should be aware that the laws and practices of certain countries require investors to pay stamp taxes and other
charges in connection with purchases of securities. In connection with the offering, the initial purchasers may
purchase and sell Notes in the open market. Purchases and sales in the open market may include short sales,
purchases to cover short positions, and stabilizing purchases. Short sales involve sales by the initial purchasers of a
greater number of Notes than they are required to purchase in the offering. Covering transactions involve purchases
of Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Stabilizing
transactions involve bids to purchase Notes so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum.
Purchases to cover short positions and stabilizing purchases, as well as other purchases by the initial purchasers for
their own accounts, may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the Notes. They
may also cause the price of the Notes to be higher than the price that would otherwise exist in the open market in the
absence of these transactions. The initial purchasers may conduct these transactions in the over-the-counter market
or otherwise. If the initial purchasers commence any of these transactions, they may discontinue them at any time.

The initial purchasers are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include
securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, corporate advisory, investment
management, principal investment, hedging, financing, and brokerage activities. Certain of the initial purchasers
and/or their respective affiliates have in the past performed commercial banking, investment banking, and advisory
services for us from time to time for which they have received customary fees and reimbursement of expenses and
may, from time to time, engage in transactions with and perform services for us in the ordinary course of their
business for which they may receive customary fees and reimbursement of expenses. In the ordinary course of their
various business activities, the initial purchasers and their respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of
investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments
(which may include bank loans and/or credit default swaps) for their own account and for the accounts of their
customers and may at any time hold long and short positions in such securities and instruments. Such investments
and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates.

The initial purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express
independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to
clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. If the initial purchasers or
their affiliates have a lending relationship with us, certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates routinely hedge,
and certain other of the initial purchasers or their affiliates may hedge, their credit exposure to us consistent with
their customary risk-management policies. A typical such hedging strategy would include these initial purchasers or
their affiliates hedging such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit
default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any
such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes.

We intend to use net proceeds of this offering, as well as the proceeds from the Initial Financing Notes, the
Financing Common Shares and cash on hand, to fund the cash portion of the purchase price for the Acquisition of
Alliance, which includes the repayment by the Seller of Alliance debt. See “Use of Proceeds.” Accordingly, certain
of the initial purchasers and/or their respective affiliates who are holders of debt of Alliance may receive a portion of
the proceeds from this offering. Certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates are or may become lenders and/or
agents under the Revolving Credit Facility, for which they receive or will receive customary fees. Barclays Capital
Inc. and PNC Capital Markets LLC and/or their respective affiliates are lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility
and have received or will receive customary fees in connection with the Revolving Credit Facility. JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A., an affiliate of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, is acting as escrow agent and will receive customary fees in

234


-----

connection therewith. In addition, SVB Leerink LLC is acting as a sell-side advisor to Alliance in connection with
the Acquisition and will receive customary fees in connection therewith.

**Settlement**

It is expected that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the date specified on the
cover of this offering memorandum, which is the      business day following the date of pricing of the Notes
(such settlement cycle being referred to as “T+   ”). Under Rule 15c-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the
secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly
agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes prior to the date that is two business days
preceding the settlement date will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will settle in T+    , to
specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent failed settlement. Purchasers of the
Notes who wish to trade the Notes during such period should consult their own advisor.

**PRIIPs Regulation / Prospectus Regulation / Prohibition of sales to EEA retail investors**

The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or
otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). For these purposes, a retail
investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive
2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended,
the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in
point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Directive 2017/1129 (as amended,
the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014
(as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to retail
investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available
to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. This offering memorandum has been
prepared on the basis that any offer of notes in any Member State of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption
under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of notes. This offering
memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

The above selling restriction is in addition to any other selling restrictions set out below.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in the United Kingdom**

The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or
otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (the “UK”). For these purposes, a retail investor
means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No
2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “EUWA”);
(ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”)
and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would
not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms
part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EU)
2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently no key information document
required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs
Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has

###### 2 Basis of preparation 

These condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the three month period ended March 31, 2021
have been prepared in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards
Codification (ASC) Topic 270, Interim Reporting. The disclosures contained in these condensed interim
consolidated financial statements in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (GAAP) do not include all the requirements of GAAP for annual financial statements. The
condensed interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020. The condensed interim consolidated
financial statements are based on accounting policies as described in the December 31, 2020 consolidated
financial statements and there has been no change in the Company’s accounting policies. Certain comparative
information has been reclassified to conform to the presentation adopted in the current fiscal period.

The condensed interim consolidated financial statements include all of the accounts of the Company, the
Subsidiaries and the Revenue Practices. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated on
consolidation.

###### 3 New accounting standards

The standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuance of the
Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements are disclosed below. The Company intends to adopt
these standards, if applicable, when they become effective.

**ASU 2018-15, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other – Internal Use Software (Topic 350-40)**

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other – Internal-Use Software
_(Topic 350-40). The ASU is intended to improve the recognition and measurement of financial instruments. The_
new guidance aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement
that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or
obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license). This
ASU is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption
permitted. For all other entities, this ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2020 and interim periods in annual reporting periods after December 15, 2021. The Company is considered an
Emerging Growth Company as classified by SEC, which gives the Company relief in the timing of
implementation of this standard by allowing the private company timing for adoption. The Company continues
to evaluate the impact of the standard on its consolidated financial statements.

**ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326)**

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326):
_Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, and related clarifying standards, which replaces the_
incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses
and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to assess credit loss
estimates. The ASU is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early
adoption permitted. For all other entities, this ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2022. The Company is considered an Emerging Growth Company as classified by SEC, which gives the
Company relief in the timing of implementation of this standard by allowing the private company timing for
adoption. The Company continues to evaluate the impact of the standard on its consolidated financial
statements.

###### 4 Variable interest entities

In accordance with the FASB’s ASC Topic 810, Consolidation, a reporting entity with a variable interest in
another entity is required to include the assets and liabilities and revenue and expenses of that separate entity
(i.e., consolidate with the financial statements of the reporting entity) when the variable interest is determined to
be a controlling financial interest. Under ASC 810, a reporting entity is considered to have a controlling financial
interest in a variable interest entity (VIE) if (1) the reporting entity has the power to direct the activities of the
VIE that most significantly impacts its economic performance and (2) the reporting entity has the obligation to
absorb losses of the VIE that could be potentially significant to the VIE.

As a result of the financial relationship established between the Company and the Revenue Practices through
respective management service agreements, the Revenue Practices individually qualify as VIEs as the
Company, which provides them non-medical, technical and administrative services, has the power to direct
their respective activities and the obligation to absorb their gains and losses. As a result, the Company is


-----

###### Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

(Unaudited)
March 31, 2021

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

considered the primary beneficiary of the Revenue Practices, and accordingly, the assets and liabilities and
revenue and expenses of the Revenue Practices are included in these condensed consolidated financial
statements. The following information excludes any intercompany transactions and costs allocated by the
Company to the Revenue Practices. The Revenue Practices’ total assets and liabilities included in the
Company’s consolidated balance sheets as at March 31, 2021 were $45.8 million (2020 – $57.0 million) and
$2.4 million (2020 – $2.4 million), respectively. The assets of the Revenue Practices can only be used to settle
their obligations. During the three month period ended March 31, 2021, the Revenue Practices’ net revenue
was $41.1 million (2020 – $40.1 million) and the net contribution to the Company’s cash flow from operations
was $51.2 million (2020 – $32.7 million). As noted above, the financial information related to the Revenue
Practices excludes any intercompany transactions and costs allocated by the Company to the Revenue
Practices.

The Company also has a variable interest in a single purpose entity in Texas which operates an imaging
center, and in certain operations of an imaging center in a separate entity, also in Texas. In both cases, the
Company is not the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entities since it does not have any equity
ownership in these entities nor does it have the power to direct the activities of either of these entities that most
significantly impact the entities’ economic performance. In both cases, the Company is entitled to a
management fee based upon written agreements. The assets and liabilities and revenue and expenses of
these entities are not included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company and the Company
earned management fee revenue related to these businesses of approximately $0.2 million (2020 - $0.1
million). The Company did not provide any financial or other support to these entities during the periods
presented.

Management estimated the fair value of the ADG Acquisition Earn-out liability as at the acquisition date at
approximately $14.7 million based on a discount rate of approximately 7% and management’s estimated
probability weighted range of the ADG Acquisition – Earn-out liability. Subsequently, the ADG Acquisition
Earn-out liability estimate was revalued at approximately $14.8 million as at December 31, 2019. During 2020
this liability was revalued at approximately $9.4 million based on a settlement reached pursuant to the terms of
the purchase agreement with the representatives of the sellers of the Company’s Georgia business and the
change in fair value was recognized in financial instruments revaluation in the related condensed consolidated
statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Fifty percent of this liability was paid in November
2020 and the balance was paid in May 2021 pursuant to the process outlined in the related purchase
agreement. During the three month period ended March 31, 2020, the Company recognized a gain of
approximately $6.5 million due to changes in fair value of the ADG Acquisition – Earn-out liability.

**2025 Senior Notes**

On November 2, 2020, the Company closed an offering of $400 million of aggregate principal amount of 7.0%
senior secured notes due November 1, 2025 (the 2025 Senior Notes). The net proceeds from this offering were
used to repay in full the Amended May 2019 Term Loans, Revolving Facility and net derivative financial
instrument liabilities, in accordance with respective contracts, and to pay related financing fees and expenses.
The balance of approximately $19 million was retained as cash. The 2025 Senior Notes are fully and
unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by the Company and each of its direct or indirect wholly
owned subsidiaries, including the Revenue Practices, and secured against substantially all of the assets of the
Company and the guarantors pari passu with the security granted in connection with the 2020 Revolving
Facility. On November 2, 2020, the 2025 Senior Notes were issued at their face value of $400 million net of
debt issuance costs of approximately $11.5 million (it is considered a Level 2 liability as described in note 12).

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

As at December 31, 2020, the 2025 Senior Notes had a face value of $400 million and an amortized cost
balance of approximately, $389 million.

On February 11, 2021 the Company completed its private offering of $75 million aggregate principal amount of
additional 7.00% senior secured notes due November 2025 (the “New Notes” and together with the 2025
Senior Notes, the 2025 Senior Notes). The New Notes were offered as additional notes under the same
indenture as the previously issued 2025 Senior Notes and will be treated as a single series with the 2025
Senior Notes. The Company has applied part of the net proceeds from the New Notes for acquisitions and
expects to use the balance of net proceeds from the New Notes for future acquisitions, with any unused
proceeds to be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. The New Notes were issued at
5.0% premium to their face value of $75 million net of debt issuance costs of approximately $1.1 million (it is
considered a Level 2 liability as described in note 12). The premium on issuance of New Notes of $3.75 million
is being amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the 2025 Senior Notes. The Company also
received accrued interest on the New Notes from November 2, 2020 to February 10, 2021 of approximately
$1.4 million. This accrued interest was repaid by the Company along with the rest of the accrued interest by
the end of the six month period ended May 1, 2021. As at March 31, 2021, the 2025 Senior Notes had a face
value of $475 million and an amortized cost balance of approximately, $467 million.

The 2025 Senior Notes indenture allows the Company to redeem the 2025 Senior Notes prior to maturity
together with any accrued and unpaid interest. The 2025 Senior Notes indenture provides for the following
(capitalized terms used below in this note and not defined elsewhere in these notes have the respective
meanings given to them in the 2025 Senior Notes indenture):

   - Payments

The principal payment is due at maturity on November 1, 2025. Interest is accrued and payable every six
months on May 1 and November 1, respectively.

   - Restrictive covenants

The 2025 Senior Notes indenture restricts the Company’s ability to, among other things: incur certain
additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock; make certain distributions, investments and other
restricted payments; sell certain assets; agree to any restrictions on the ability of Subsidiaries (including
the Revenue Practices) to make payments to the Company; create certain liens; merge, consolidate or
sell substantially all of the Company’s assets; and enter into certain transactions with affiliates. These
covenants are subject to exceptions and qualifications and many of these covenants will not be applicable
during any period when the 2025 Senior Notes have an investment grade rating.

###### Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

(Unaudited)

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

   - Financial covenants

There are no maintenance financial covenants. There are incurrence-based covenants related to the
restrictive covenants noted above. The Company is in compliance with the covenants and has no events
of default under this indenture as at March 31, 2021.

   - Events of default

Events of default under the 2025 Senior Notes indenture include, among others, failure to pay principal of
or interest on the 2025 Senior Notes and certain final judgments when due (subject to appropriate periods
and conditions); failure to comply, within appropriate period, with obligations under certain covenants or
any provision in the 2025 Senior Notes indenture; certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency and if any
Guarantee by a Significant Subsidiary is held in a judicial proceeding to be unenforceable or invalid. The
occurrence of an event of default would permit the Trustee or holders of at least 25% of the 2025 Senior
Notes to declare all of the 2025 Senior Notes together with unpaid accrued interest, to be immediately due
and payable and to exercise other default remedies.

**2020 Revolving Facility**

Concurrently with the closing of the 2025 Senior Notes, the Company entered into a new revolving credit
agreement (the 2020 Revolving Credit Agreement) with a US financial institution, as administrative and
collateral agent, and other financial institutions, as lenders, to provide a senior secured revolving credit facility
in an aggregate principal amount of $55 million (the 2020 Revolving Facility, and together with 2025 Senior
Notes, the 2025 Loans), with sub-limits for the issuance of letters of credit and for swingline loans. The 2020
Revolving Facility is secured pari passu with the obligations under the 2025 Senior Notes. The 2020 Revolving
Facility will mature on the date that is five years after the issue date (the 2020 Revolving Facility Maturity Date);
provided that, if more than $50 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Senior Notes is outstanding on
the date that is 181 days prior to the 2020 Revolving Facility Maturity Date, then the 2020 Revolving Facility
Maturity Date shall instead be the date that is 181 days prior to the 2020 Revolving Facility Maturity Date.

The availability of borrowings under the 2020 Revolving Facility is subject to customary terms and conditions.
The 2020 Revolving Facility was undrawn at November 2, 2020 (it is considered a Level 3 liability as described
in note 12). The issuance costs related to this credit facility were approximately $2.0 million (including
approximately $0.9 million related to the prior Revolving Facility since the settlement of that Revolving Facility
was considered debt modification for accounting purposes). These costs are included in security deposits and
other assets in the balance sheet and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2020
Revolving Facility. The annual commitment fee related to the 2020 Revolving Facility is capped at 0.5% of the
aggregate principal amount of $55 million. As at March 31, 2021, the 2020 Revolving Facility had a face value
and amortized cost balance of $nil (2020 - $nil).

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

The 2020 Revolving Credit Agreement provides for the following (capitalized terms used below in this note and
not defined elsewhere in these notes have the respective meanings given to them in the 2020 Revolving Credit
Agreement):

   - Interest

The interest rates payable on the 2020 Revolving Facility are as follows: (i) each Eurodollar Rate Loan
bears interest on the outstanding principal amount at Adjusted Eurodollar Rate (effectively, LIBOR) plus
the Applicable Rate; (ii) each Base Rate Loan bears interest on the outstanding principal amount at the
Base Rate (the highest of (a) the Prime Rate, (b) the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Rate plus 0.5%
and (c) one-month Adjusted Eurodollar Rate plus 1.0%) plus the Applicable Rate; and (iii) each Swingline
Loan bears interest on the outstanding principal amount at the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate. Since
no amount has been drawn under the 2020 Revolving Facility since its inception, the annualized effective
interest rate under the 2020 Revolving Credit Agreement during the three months ended March 31, 2021
is not applicable (2020 – nil). With respect to interest rate sensitivity as at March 31, 2021, a 1% increase
in variable interest rates would have increased interest expense under the 2020 Revolving Facility for the
three months ended March 31, 2021 by $nil (2020 – $nil).

   - Restrictive covenants

In addition to certain covenants, the 2020 Revolving Credit Agreement places limits on the Company’s
ability to declare dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock (including options or warrants), prepay,
redeem or purchase debt, incur liens and engage in sale-leaseback transactions, make loans and
investments, incur additional indebtedness, amend or otherwise alter debt and other material agreements,
engage in mergers, acquisitions and asset sales, enter into transactions with affiliates and alter the
business the Company and the Subsidiaries currently conduct.

   - Financial covenant

The 2020 Revolving Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant related to a leverage ratio that is
tested on the last day of any fiscal quarter (commencing with the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2021)
only if on the last day of any such fiscal quarter, the outstanding amount under the 2020 Revolving Facility
(excluding certain letter of credit obligations) exceeds 30% of the total commitment under the 2020
Revolving Facility of $55 million.

Borrowings under the 2020 Revolving Facility were nil as at March 31, 2021 and therefore did not exceed
30% of the total commitment under the 2020 Revolving Facility. As a result, the Company is in
compliance with the financial covenant. No event of default under the 2020 Revolving Credit Agreement
had occurred as at March 31, 2021.

   - Events of default

Events of default under the 2020 Revolving Credit Agreement include, among others, failure to pay
principal of or interest on the 2020 Revolving Facility when due, failure to pay any fee or other amount
due, failure of any loan party to comply with any covenants or agreements in the loan documents (subject
to applicable grace periods and/or notice requirements), a representation or warranty contained in the
loan documents is incorrect or misleading in a material respect when made, events of bankruptcy and a

change of control. The occurrence of an event of default would permit the lenders under the 2020
Revolving Credit Agreement to declare all amounts borrowed, together with accrued interest and fees, to
be immediately due and payable and to exercise other default remedies.

**Wesley Chapel Loan**

As part of the Rose Acquisition in 2018, the Company, through a subsidiary, assumed a senior secured loan
(Wesley Chapel Loan) of $2,000,000 (face value) as of August 15, 2018 to finance the purchase of equipment
and related installation at a clinic location around Tampa Bay, Florida. It has an annual interest rate of 5.0%,
matures on August 15, 2023 and has monthly repayments of $37,742. The Wesley Chapel Loan was
recognized at fair value of $1,908,456 on August 15, 2018 using an effective interest rate. The fair value was
determined based on management’s estimation of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing
similar liabilities (it is considered a Level 3 liability as described in note 12). As at March 31, 2021, the Wesley
Chapel Loan had an amortized cost balance of approximately, $1.0 million.

###### 10 Commitments and contingencies

The Company is party to various legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and
investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business. With respect to these matters, the management
evaluates the developments on a regular basis and accrues a liability when it believes a loss is probable and
the amount can be reasonably estimated. We believe that the amount or any estimable range of reasonably
possible or probable loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our
business and condensed consolidated financial statements. However, the outcome of these matters is
inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against the Company for
amounts in excess of management's expectations, our results of operations and financial condition, including in


-----

###### Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially
adversely affected.

Commencing during Q1 2020 and continuing through the present and beyond, a pandemic relating to the novel
coronavirus known as COVID-19 occurred causing significant financial market disruption and social dislocation.
The pandemic is dynamic with various cities, counties, states and countries around the world responding or
having responded in different ways to address and contain the outbreak, including the declaration of a global
pandemic by the World Health Organization, a National State of Emergency in the United States and state and
local executive orders and ordinances forcing the closure of non essential businesses and persons not
employed in or using essential services to “stay at home” or “shelter in place”. At this stage, we have no
certainty as to how long the pandemic, or a more limited epidemic, will last, what regions will be most affected
or to what extent containment measures will be applied.

Imaging centers are healthcare facilities and as such are generally considered an essential service and
expected to continue to operate during any epidemic or pandemic. However, there is potential that actions
taken by government, referring physicians or individual actions, in response to containment or avoidance of this
coronavirus could impact a patient’s ability or decision to seek imaging services at a given time which could
have a significant impact on volume at our imaging centers leading to temporary or prolonged staff layoffs,
reduced hours, closures and other cost containment efforts. Further, there is potential that certain services
which are not urgent and can be deferred without significant harm to a patient’s health may be delayed, either
by the Company in response to local laws or good public health practice or voluntarily by the patient. In
addition, there is potential that the outbreak of the coronavirus could impact supply chains, including the
Company’s supply of personal protective equipment, and lead to personnel shortages, each of which could
impact the ability of the Company to safely perform imaging services. It is also possible that social distancing
efforts and sanitization and decontamination procedures could cause delays in the performance of imaging
services. Depending on the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is potential for the
Company to incur incremental implicit price concessions beyond what is currently expected and potential future
reduction in revenue and income and asset impairments.

###### 11 Segmented financial information

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief
operating decision maker. The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and
assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer. The
Company has one reportable segment, which is outpatient diagnostic imaging services.

###### 12 Risk management arising from financial instruments

The carrying value of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities and leases (current
portion) approximates their fair value given their short-term nature.

The carrying value of the non-current portion of leases approximates their fair value given the difference
between the discount rates used to recognize the liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and
the normalized expected market rates of interest is insignificant. The estimated fair values of other non-current
liabilities were as follows:

Financial instruments recorded at fair value on the condensed consolidated balance sheets are classified using
a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements. The fair
value hierarchy has the following levels:

- Level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. As at March 31,
2021, the Company did not have any financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value under the Level 1
category.

- Level 2 – inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability;
either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices). As at March 31, 2021, the 2025
Senior Notes were measured at fair value under the Level 2 category on recognition. As at March 31,
2021, the Company did not have any derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments are
measured at fair value under the Level 2 category on recognition and are subsequently remeasured at fair
value under the Level 2 category.

- Level 3 – inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable
inputs). As at March 31, 2021, the Company did not have any financial assets or liabilities measured at fair
value under the Level 3 category.

The Wesley Chapel Loan and ADG Acquisition – Earn-out were measured at fair value under the Level 3
category on recognition. The ADG Acquisition – Earn-out was subsequently remeasured at fair value under the
Level 3 category and its value was later determined based on execution of a settlement agreement in
November 2020 as discussed in note 6.

The following table summarizes information regarding the change in carrying value of the Company’s financial
instruments carried at fair value.

During Q1 2020, an unrealized gain of approximately $6.5 million in relation to the ADG Acquisition – Earn-out
liability was recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income
(loss) in the category “Operational financial instruments revaluation and other (gains) losses”. There was no
change in its value in Q1 2021. Apart from the value of the ADG Acquisition – Earn-out liability being
determined based on execution of a settlement agreement in November 2020, there were no transfers between
levels during the three months ended March 31, 2021 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. A
transfer is made between levels during the period that a financial instrument meets the relevant criteria.

Financial instruments are classified into one of the following categories: amortized cost, fair value through profit

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

**Credit risk**

The Company has a diverse mix of payers, including private, managed care, capitated and government payers.
Credit risk arises from the potential a counterparty will fail to perform its obligations. The Company is exposed
to credit risk from customers. The Company grants credit to its customers in the normal course of business.
The condensed consolidated financial statements take into account an allowance for bad debts. The Company
is exposed to credit risk from its customers but the concentration of the risk is minimized because of the large
customer base and its dispersion across different payers. During the quarter, the Company may have deposits
with financial institutions that exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits. As at March 31, 2021, the
Company had cash of $122.7 million (2020 – $44.4 million) and accounts receivable of $95.9 million (2020 –
$91.1 million).

Collectability of the receivables is actively monitored on an ongoing basis and an allowance or a write-off of
allowance for bad debts is established by management. At each reporting period, the Company determines
whether an allowance or write-off is required by estimating the expected credit losses based on a combination
of probability-weighted historic and actual bad debts experience with consideration of forward-looking
information including changes to economic conditions that would impact its customers (such as unemployment
rate and general economic environment for non-individual payors). During the period affected by the COVID-19
pandemic, management’s consideration of those changes to economic conditions included the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic.

**Currency risk**

Currency risk is the risk to the Company’s earnings that arises from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and
the degree of volatility of those rates. In the normal course of business, the Company may enter into foreign
exchange contracts with financial institutions to hedge the value of foreign currency denominated assets. Gains
and losses arising from these contracts offset the losses and gains from the underlying hedged transactions. As
at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company did not enter into any foreign exchange contracts
that would expose the Company to currency risk.

**Interest rate risk**

Interest rate risk is the risk the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of
changes in market interest rates. Changes in lending rates can cause fluctuations in interest payments and
cash flows. The Company currently does not use derivative financial instruments to alter the effects of this risk.
As at March 31, 2021, the Company’s variable interest rate debt only related to the 2020 Revolving Facility
(note 8), which was not drawn during the thee-month period ended March 31, 2021 or during 2020. Hence, the
Company’s exposure to interest rate risk from the 2020 Revolving Facility from a 1% increase or decrease in
the variable interest rates was $nil (2020 - $nil).

###### 16 CARES Act

i) During April 2020, the Company received approximately $1.1 million in grant under the first appropriation
made by the U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) to Medicare providers pursuant to the Coronavirus
Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act). Subsequently, in December 2020, the Company
received an additional grant from the HHS of approximately $4 million and in April 2021, the Company
received an additional grant from the HHS of approximately $0.8 million. Additional grants may be available
to the Company through subsequent appropriations under this program. The Company applied for these
grants after determining that it was eligible to do so. Also, the Company has incurred expenses and
experienced loss of revenue that are eligible to be reimbursed under these grants. The grants received are
recorded in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) in the
category “Other revenue”.

ii) During April 2020, the Company received approximately $3.1 million of accelerated Medicare payments

under the expanded Accelerated and Advance Payments Program from Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
Service (CMS). These payments are required to be applied to claims beginning one year after their receipt
through the adjudication of Medicare claims over a future period. These payments to the Company are
recorded in the condensed consolidated balance sheets in the category “Accounts payable and accrued
liabilities” until earned.

iii) The CARES Act allows employers to defer the deposit and payment of the employer's share of Social

Security taxes. As of March 31, 2021, such taxes were approximately $2.7 million and approximately $1.3

million are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets in the category “Accrued payroll taxes” and the
remaining balance in the category “Accounts payable and accrued liabilities”.

###### 17 Other investments

Effective March 1, 2021, the Company completed a common equity investment in an artificial intelligence
business as part of a private placement offering for approximately $4.6 million (it is noted in the condensed
consolidated statements of cash flows in the category “Investing activities”). The target develops artificial
intelligence aided software programs for use in medical businesses, including outpatient imaging services
of the sort provided by the Company. As a result of the investment, a previous investment in a convertible
note instrument issued by the target to the Company in May 2020 converted for common equity. The
Company’s total common equity investment is estimated to be valued at approximately $8.0 million and
represents a 34.5% interest in the target on a non-diluted basis. In addition, the Company holds share
purchase warrants which, subject to the occurrence of certain events and certain assumptions, and the
payment of approximately $0.4 million, would entitle the Company to acquire approximately a further 2.4%
interest in the target’s common equity. During the three month period ended March 31, 2021, the
Company recognized a gain of approximately $3.4 million on the conversion of the convertible note
instrument to common equity and the share purchase warrants. This gain is included in the condensed
consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) in the category “Other financial
instruments revaluation and other (gains) losses”.

###### 18 Income taxes

The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2021 differs from the Canadian statutory rate
of 26.5% primarily due to earnings in foreign jurisdictions that are subject to tax rates, which differ from the
Canadian statutory tax rate, as well as the impact of valuation allowances applied against losses in
jurisdictions for which no tax benefit or expense is recognized.

###### 19 Subsequent events 

i) On April 1, 2021, the Company announced that it had entered into definitive agreements to acquire six
freestanding, fixed-site outpatient diagnostic imaging clinics located in Florida. The acquisitions have an
aggregate purchase price of $39 million, subject to certain customary purchase price adjustments. $3.9
million, or 10%, of the aggregate purchase price is to be paid in common shares of Akumin based on the
volume-weighted average price for the shares on the NASDAQ for the 20 trading days preceding the
closing, subject to a $4.00 per share floor. This transaction closed on May 1, 2021. The Company is in the
process of determining the preliminary purchase price allocation.

ii) On May 1, 2021, the Company closed a tuck-in acquisition for a single clinic in South Florida for a

purchase price of $0.8 million. The Company is in the process of determining the preliminary purchase
price allocation.

iii) On November 2, 2020, the Company reached a settlement with the sellers of its Georgia business

pursuant to the process contemplated by the purchase agreement for that business which valued the ADG
Acquisition - Earn-out at approximately $9.4 million. In accordance with the terms of the purchase

agreement between the parties, 50% of the value of ADG Acquisition - Earn-out (approximately $4.7
million) was paid within 5 business days after the value was finally determined, on November 9, 2020. The
remaining balance was paid on May 10, 2021.

**Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm**

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Akumin Inc.

**Opinion on the Financial Statements**

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Akumin Inc. (the Company) as of December 31,

2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), changes in

equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes

(collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial

statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2020 and

2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31,

2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

**Basis for Opinion**

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an

opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with

the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with

respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations

of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan

and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material

misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to

perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an

understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the

effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,

whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included

examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits

also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as

evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis

for our opinion.

###### 2 Summary of significant accounting policies 

The Company adopted the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) as
the basis of preparation for the comparative 2020 and 2019 annual financial statements effective for the fiscal
year-ended December 31, 2020. Previously, the Company’s financial statements were prepared in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards
Board (IASB), for the period up to and including the 9-months ended September 30, 2020. On August 28,
2020, the Company filed a Form 40-F with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to
Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This filing resulted in the Company becoming an “SEC
Issuer” for purposes of National Instrument 51-102 -- Continuous Disclosure Obligations and as such the
Company is entitled to prepare and report its financial statements in GAAP as opposed to IFRS.

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities and contingencies.
Although actual results in subsequent periods may differ from these estimates, such estimates are developed
based on the best information available to management and based on management’s best judgments at the
time. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience, observable trends and various other


-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. All significant assumptions and
estimates underlying the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes
are regularly reviewed and updated when necessary. Changes in estimates are reflected prospectively in the
consolidated financial statements based upon on-going trends, or subsequent settlements, and realization
depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. Although we believe that our
estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates.

The most significant assumptions and estimates underlying these consolidated financial statements involve
accounts receivable, impairments of long-lived assets including goodwill, operating lease right-of-use-assets,
income taxes, business combinations and revenue recognition.

The significant accounting policies described below have been applied consistently to all periods presented.

**Principles of consolidation**

The consolidated financial statements include all of the accounts of the Company, the Subsidiaries and the
Revenue Practices. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated on consolidation.

**Variable interest entities**

In accordance with the FASB’s ASC Topic 810, Consolidation, a reporting entity with a variable interest in
another entity is required to include the assets and liabilities and revenue and expenses of that separate entity
(i.e., consolidate with the financial statements of the reporting entity) when the variable interest is determined to
be a controlling financial interest. Under ASC 810, a reporting entity is considered to have a controlling financial
interest in a variable interest entity (VIE) if (1) the reporting entity has the power to direct the activities of the
VIE that most significantly impacts its economic performance and (2) the reporting entity has the obligation to
absorb losses of the VIE that could be potentially significant to the VIE.

As a result of the financial relationship established between the Company and the Revenue Practices through
respective management service agreements, the Revenue Practices individually qualify as VIEs as the
Company, which provides them non-medical, technical and administrative services, has the power to direct
their respective activities and the obligation to absorb their gains and losses. As a result, the Company is
considered the primary beneficiary of the Revenue Practices, and accordingly, the assets and liabilities and
revenue and expenses of the Revenue Practices are included in these consolidated financial statements. The
following information excludes any intercompany transactions and costs allocated by the Company to the
Revenue Practices. The Revenue Practices’ assets and liabilities included in the Company’s consolidated
balance sheets as at December 31, 2020 were $57.0 million (2019 – $58.7 million) and $2.4 million (2019 –
$nil), respectively. The assets of the Revenue Practices can only be used to settle their obligations. During the
twelve month period ended December 31, 2020, the Revenue Practices’ net revenue was $139.1 million (2019
– $151.9 million) and the net contribution to the Company’s cash flow from operations was $134.7 million (2019
– $112.0 million).

The Company has a variable interest in a single purpose entity in Texas which operates an imaging center.
The Company also has a variable interest in certain operations of an imaging center of another Texas entity. In
both cases, the Company is not a primary beneficiary of the variable interest since it does not have any equity
ownership in these entities nor does it have the power to direct the activities of either of these entities that most
significantly impact the entities’ economic performance. Rather, in both cases, the Company is entitled to a

management fee based upon written agreements in exchange for certain agreed upon management services.
The assets and liabilities and revenue and expenses of these entities are not included in the consolidated
financial statements of the Company.

**Functional and reporting currency and foreign currency translation**

The functional and reporting currency of the Company, the Subsidiaries and the Revenue Practices is US
dollars. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into US dollars at the
rates of exchange prevailing at the consolidated balance sheet dates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are
translated at rates prevailing at the dates of acquisition. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average
rate of exchange in effect during the month the transaction occurred. All exchange gains and losses are
recognized in the current year’s earnings.

**Cash**

Cash includes cash on hand and cash held with banks.

**Property and equipment**

Property and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the
straight line method, as follows:

Medical equipment and equipment under finance leases six years

Computer and office equipment four to five years

Furniture and fittings nine years

Leasehold improvements over term of lease

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Operating lease right-of-use
equipment buyouts and significant upgrades are capitalized.

**Intangible assets**

The Company classifies intangible assets, obtained through acquisitions or developed internally, as definite
lived. Intangible assets consist of software costs, trade name, license arrangements and covenants not to
compete; these intangible assets are recorded at cost and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, using
the straight line method, as follows:

Software costs, trade name and license arrangements five to six years

Covenant not to compete over term of contract

The Company reviews the appropriateness of the amortization period related to the definite lived intangible
assets annually.

**Goodwill**

In January 2017, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2017-04, Goodwill and Other (Topic 350):
_Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment (ASU 2017-04). ASU 2017-04 simplifies the measurement of_
goodwill by eliminating the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill (step 2 of the current
impairment test) to measure goodwill impairment charge. Instead, entities will record impairment charges based


-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

on the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value. ASU 2017-04 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company elected to early adopt ASU
2017-04 on January 1, 2019. There was no material impact for the Company from the adoption of ASU 201704.

Goodwill is recognized as the fair value of the consideration transferred, less the fair value of the net identifiable
assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as at the acquisition date. Subsequent to initial recognition, goodwill is
measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill acquired in business combinations is allocated
to reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The determination of
reporting units and the level at which goodwill is monitored requires judgment by management. The Company’s
reporting units generally represent individual business units below the level of the Company’s operating
segment. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment as at October 1 or whenever indicators of impairment are
present by comparing the carrying amount of the reporting units against its fair value.

**Impairment of long-lived assets**

The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If any indication exists, the Company estimates the
recoverable amount.

The Company assesses the recoverability of the assets based on the undiscounted future cash flows expected
from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be
recoverable, a write-down to fair value is recorded.

Fair values are determined based on quoted market values, discounted cash flows, or external appraisals, as
applicable. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less
costs to sell.

The amount of the impairment charge is calculated as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair
value, which generally represents the discounted future cash flows from that asset or in the case of assets we
expect to sell, at fair value less costs to sell.

**Segment reporting**

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief
operating decision maker. The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and
assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer. The
Company has one reportable segment, which is outpatient diagnostic imaging services.

**Revenue recognition**

On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
_606), and related clarifying standards (ASC 606). ASC 606 outlines a single comprehensive model for_
recognizing revenue as performance obligations, defined in a contract with a customer as goods or services
transferred to the customer in exchange for consideration, are satisfied. The standard also requires expanded
disclosures regarding the Company’s revenue recognition policies and significant judgments used in the
determination of revenue.


-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

The Company adopted ASC 606 with a full retrospective application. As a result, at the adoption of ASC 606,
the majority of what was previously classified as the provision for bad debts in the consolidated statement of
operations is now reflected as implicit price concessions (as defined in ASC 606) and therefore included as a
reduction to revenue. Net service fee revenue consists of net patient fees received from various payers and
patients based on established contractual billing rates, less allowances for contractual adjustments and implicit
price concessions. It primarily comprises fees for the use of the Company’s diagnostic imaging equipment and
provision of medical supplies.

Service fee revenue is recorded during the period in which the Company’s performance obligations are
satisfied, based on the estimated collectible amounts from the patients and third party payers. The Company’s
performance obligations are satisfied when services are rendered to the patient. Since the gap between
payment and delivery of services to patients is generally expected to be less than one year, the Company does
not adjust the service fee revenue for a significant financing component, as a practical expedient. Third party
payers include federal and state agencies (under the Medicare and Medicaid programs), managed care health
plans, commercial insurance companies, attorneys, and employers. Estimates of contractual allowances and
the transaction price are based on the terms specified in the related contractual agreements, negotiated rates
and historical and expected payment patterns. The Company estimates its expected reimbursement for
patients based on the applicable contract terms and negotiated rates. The Company believes its review
process enables it to identify instances on a timely basis where such estimates need to be revised.

Other revenue consists of miscellaneous fees under contractual arrangements, including service fee revenue
under capitation arrangements with third party payers, management fees, government grants and fees for other
services provided to third parties. Revenue is recorded during the period in which the Company’s performance
obligations under the contract are satisfied by the Company. For 2020, the Company received grants from the
U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS). Such grants are outside the scope of ASC 606 and are further
discussed in note 25.

ASC 606 applies a single model for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers. It requires revenue to
be recognized in a manner that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to a customer and at an
amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring those goods or
services. This is achieved by applying the following five steps:

i) identify the contract with a customer;

ii) identify the performance obligation in the contract;

iii) determine the transaction price;

iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and

v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.

**Earnings per share**

Basic earnings per common share (EPS) is calculated by dividing the net earnings available to common
shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is


-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

calculated by adjusting the net earnings available to common shareholders and the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive instruments.

**Income taxes**

Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognized in the consolidated
statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Current income tax expense represents the
amount of income taxes payable based on tax law that is enacted at the reporting date and is adjusted for
changes in estimates of tax expense recognized in prior periods. A current tax liability or asset is recognized for
income taxes payable, or paid but recoverable, in respect of all periods to date.

The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred
tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of
assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the
differences are expected to reverse. A deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and
deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be
available to utilize such amounts. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are adjusted to
the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefits will be realized. When it appears more likely
than not that deferred taxes will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax
asset to its estimated realizable value. For net deferred tax assets, estimates of future taxable income are
considered in determining whether net deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and the
Company intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

The Company reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to
unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

**Financial instruments**

Financial assets (such as accounts receivable) and liabilities (such as accounts payable, accrued liabilities,
leases and loans) at amortized cost are initially recognized at fair value, and subsequently are carried at
amortized cost (using the effective interest rate method) less any impairment. Any premium or discount
between amortized cost and fair value is amortized to the consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive income (loss). Derivative financial instruments and earn-outs are initially recognized and
subsequently measured at fair value. No derivatives have been designated as a cash flow hedge under ASC
815, Derivatives and Hedging. Please see note 16 for additional information.

**Leases**

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02. The FASB subsequently issued related clarifying ASUs on
leases. ASU 2016-02’s core principle is to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by
recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information. ASU 2016-02 is
effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. ASU
2016-02 requires application either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented in the financial
statements or under a modified retrospective approach at the beginning of the period of adoption. The
Company adopted ASU 2016-02 using a modified retrospective approach on January 1, 2019.


-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

On January 1, 2019, the Company recorded right-of-use assets and lease liabilities of $98,912,687 and
$98,912,687, respectively. Accounting for finance leases remained substantially unchanged (they continue to
be recognized on the consolidated balance sheets).

The Company’s operating lease portfolio primarily consists of real estate leases for its imaging centres and
corporate offices. A smaller portion consists of medical and office equipment leases. The Company elected to
use the package of practical expedients offered in the transition guidance that allows management not to
reassess lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. The Company also elected to use the
accounting policy practical expedients by class of underlying asset to (i) combine associated lease and nonlease components into a single lease component; and (ii) exclude recording short-term leases as right-of-use
assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.

Operating lease liabilities were recorded as the present value of remaining lease payments not yet paid for the
lease term discounted using the incremental borrowing rate associated with each lease. Operating lease rightof-use assets represent operating lease liabilities adjusted for prepayments, accrued lease payments, lease
incentives and initial direct costs. Certain of the Company’s leases include renewal or termination options.
Calculation of operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities includes the initial lease term unless it is
reasonably certain a renewal or termination option will be exercised. The Company's initial real estate lease
term typically varies from approximately 3 to 10 years. Including renewal options, the lease term may vary from
approximately 10 to 30 years.

Variable components of lease payments fluctuating with a future index or rate are estimated at lease
commencement based on the index or rate at lease commencement. If the payments change as the result of a
change in an index or rate subsequent to lease commencement, the difference is recognized in the income
statement in the period in which the change occurs. Variable payments for maintenance such as common area
maintenance costs and taxes, are not included in determining lease payments and are expensed as incurred.
Most of the Company’s leases do not contain implicit borrowing rates, and therefore to measure lease liabilities,
the Company used its incremental borrowing rates at the later of the lease commencement date or January 1,
2019. Lease liabilities will be remeasured when there is a significant change in the lease contracts.

**Warrants**

Financial instruments issued by the Company are classified as equity only to the extent they do not meet the
definition of a financial liability or financial asset. The Company has issued warrants that are convertible into
common stock; these warrants are classified as equity instruments.

**Restricted share units**

Restricted share units (RSUs) are issued in accordance with the Company’s RSU Plan, which entitles a holder
of one RSU to receive one common share of the Company. RSUs are assigned a value based on the market
value of the common shares of the Company on the grant date (or the nearest working day prior to the grant
date). Such value is classified as stock-based compensation over the vesting period for all RSUs awarded to
employees or the Board (note 12). For RSUs awarded to non-employees for business services, the RSU
expense would be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss)
on vesting of such RSUs.

**Stock-based compensation**


-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

The Company’s stock-based compensation consists of stock options, which are described in note 15 and
RSUs, which are discussed in note 12. Each tranche of a share option award is considered a separate award
with its own vesting period and recorded at fair value on the date of grant. The fair value of each tranche is
measured at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Compensation expense is
recognized over the tranche’s vesting period based on the number of awards expected to vest by increasing
contributed surplus. Any consideration paid upon the exercise of stock options is credited to common stock and
the related fair value of those stock options is transferred from the contributed surplus to common stock.

**Business combinations**

In January 2019, the Company adopted FASB issued ASU 2017-01, Clarifying the Definition of a Business
_(2017-01). The update provides a framework for evaluating whether a transaction should be accounted for as_
an acquisition and/or disposal of a business versus assets. In order for a purchase to be considered an
acquisition of a business, and receive business combination accounting treatment, the set of transferred assets
and activities must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly
contribute to the ability to create outputs. If substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is
concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, then the set of transferred
assets and activities is not a business. As a result of adoption on January 1, 2019, there was no impact on our
consolidated financial statements, and we have applied the guidance to subsequent acquisitions.

The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition accounting method. The total purchase
price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on fair values as at the date of
acquisition. Goodwill as at the acquisition date is measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration
transferred and the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquired company over the net of the
acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Any non-controlling
interests in the acquired company are measured at their fair value. Best estimates and assumptions are used in
the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the
business combination date. These estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and are subject to
refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the business
combination date, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with
the corresponding offset to goodwill. On conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the
values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are
recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) in the period in which
the adjustments were determined.

**Changes in non-controlling interests**

The Company treats transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in a loss of control as
transactions with equity owners of the Company. A change in ownership interest results in an adjustment
between the carrying amounts of the controlling and non-controlling interests to reflect their relative interests in
the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount of the adjustment to non-controlling interests and any
consideration paid or received is recognized in a reserve within equity attributable to owners of Akumin.

**Contingencies**

Loss contingency is an existing condition, situation, or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible
loss to an entity that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The


-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

Company is party to various legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and
investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal
proceedings that are pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings,
the Company, with assistance from its legal counsel, evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings
or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought.
Accrued legal costs for legal contingencies are recorded when they are probable and estimable.

**Accounts receivable**

Accounts receivable are generally non-interest bearing, unsecured obligations due from patients and third-party
payers. They are recognized initially at net realizable value and are subsequently measured at amortized cost
less loss allowances. In addition to the implicit price concessions considered and recorded when the service
was performed, at each reporting period, the Company estimates the expected credit losses based on a
combination of probability-weighted historic and actual bad debts experience with consideration of forwardlooking information including changes to economic conditions that would impact its customers (such as
unemployment rate and general economic environment for non-individual payors). During the period affected
by the COVID-19 pandemic, management’s consideration of those changes to economic conditions included
the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Accounts receivable are considered to be in default when customers have failed to make the contractually
required payments when due. Implicit price concessions are recorded as a reduction in revenue with an
offsetting amount reducing the carrying value of the receivable. When a receivable is considered uncollectible,
the receivable is written off against the allowance for bad debts account.

In the fourth quarter of 2020, due to slow down in collections of receivables, the Company changed its
estimates of the implicit price concessions related to its customers, primarily based on historical experience of
collections impacted by the pandemic and the integration of diagnostic imaging centers acquired in 2018 and
2019. The result of this change in estimate resulted in an increase as compared to the year ended December
31, 2019 to the cumulative implicit price concessions for outstanding receivables by approximately $12.3 million
($9.4 million net of tax) in the year ended 2020, or $0.13 per share (basic and diluted) for the three and twelve
months ended December 31, 2020.

###### 3 Business combinations

i) On January 1, 2020, the Company acquired, through a subsidiary, a single outpatient diagnostic
imaging centre in Coral Springs, Florida, for cash consideration of approximately $2.1 million (Coral
Springs Acquisition). In accordance with the transaction agreement, $100,000 of this purchase price
(Holdback Fund) was withheld as security for indemnity obligations and was released to the seller
during June 2020. This asset acquisition was considered a business combination. The Company has
made a fair value determination of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities as follows:

Company’s expectation of future benefits from the acquired business and workforce, and potential
synergies from cost savings. The results of operations of this acquisition have been included in the
Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) from the acquisition
date. Since the acquisition date, this acquisition contributed revenue of approximately $4.1 million and
income before tax of approximately $0.7 million to the Company’s consolidated results for the twelve
months ended December 31, 2020. In our estimation, this acquisition would have contributed revenue of
approximately $5.4 million and income before tax of approximately $0.9 million to the Company’s
consolidated results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019.

ii) On January 1, 2020, the Company acquired, through a subsidiary, a single outpatient diagnostic imaging
centre in Crystal Lake, Illinois, for cash consideration of approximately $1.2 million (Crystal Lake
Acquisition). In accordance with the transaction agreement, $60,000 of this purchase price (Holdback
Fund) was withheld as security for indemnity obligations and was released to the seller during June 2020.
This asset acquisition was considered a business combination. The Company has made a fair value

date, this acquisition contributed revenue of approximately $1.0 million and income before tax of
approximately $0.2 million to the Company’s consolidated results for the twelve months ended December
31, 2020. In our estimation, this acquisition would have contributed revenue of approximately $1.1 million
and income before tax of approximately $0.2 million to the Company’s consolidated results for the twelve

This acquisition was an opportunity for the Company to increase its economies of scale across Florida.
The goodwill assessed on acquisition, expected to be deductible for income tax purposes, reflects the
Company’s expectation of future benefits from the acquired business and workforce, and potential
synergies from cost savings. The results of operations of this acquisition have been included in the
Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) from the acquisition
date. Since the acquisition date, this acquisition contributed revenue of approximately $0.4 million and loss
before tax of approximately $41 thousand to the Company’s consolidated results for the twelve months
ended December 31, 2019.

The Company has estimated the contribution to the Company’s consolidated results from this acquisition
had the business combination occurred at the beginning of the year. Had the business combination
occurred at the beginning of fiscal 2019, this business combination would have contributed approximately
$0.5 million in revenue and $54 thousand in loss before tax for the twelve months ended December 31,
2019, and consolidated pro forma revenue and income before tax for the same period would have been
approximately $247.6 million and $13.2 million, respectively. These estimates should not be used as an
indicator of past or future performance of the Company or the acquisition.

iv) On April 15, 2019, the Company announced that it had, through a subsidiary, entered into purchase
agreements to acquire 27 imaging centres (Florida – 21 and Georgia – 6) operated under ADG, The
Imaging Centers of West Palm and Elite Radiology of Georgia. All of these centres were managed by
ADG’s management team. On May 31, 2019, the Company announced the closing of these acquisitions.
Pursuant to the purchase agreements, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding equity
interests of ADG Acquisition Holdings, Inc., TIC Acquisition Holdings, LLC and SFL Radiology Holdings,
LLC (the ADG Acquisitions).

The total purchase price (excluding earn-out) for the ADG Acquisitions at closing (including preliminary
working capital adjustments and payment for cash acquired) was approximately $216 million, of which
$23.4 million was satisfied by the issuance of 6.25 million common shares of the Company at a price of
$3.75 per share based on the share price at the close of May 31, 2019. The balance of this purchase price
was mostly financed through the Term Loans (note 10). A portion of the purchase price payable in respect
of the acquisition of SFL Radiology Holdings, LLC is subject to an earn-out based on annualized revenues
earned in the first two quarters of 2020 less certain costs (note 8). Subsequent to the completion of the

acquisition, the cash purchase price was reduced by approximately $0.2 million due to working capital
adjustments in accordance with the purchase agreement.

The Company has made a fair value determination of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities as at the

This acquisition was an opportunity for the Company to increase its economies of scale across Florida.
The goodwill assessed on acquisition, expected to be deductible for income tax purposes, reflects the
Company’s expectation of future benefits from the acquired business and workforce, and potential
synergies from cost savings. The results of operations of this acquisition have been included in the
Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) from the acquisition
date. Since the acquisition date, this acquisition contributed revenue of approximately $1.9 million and
income before tax of approximately $0.6 million to the Company’s consolidated results for the twelve
months ended December 31, 2019.

The Company has estimated the contribution to the Company’s consolidated results from this acquisition
had the business combination occurred at the beginning of the year. Had the business combination
occurred at the beginning of fiscal 2019, this business combination would have contributed approximately
$3.2 million in revenue and $1.0 million in income before tax for the twelve months ended December 31,
2019, and consolidated pro forma revenue and income before tax for the same period would have been

Other 7,959,941 7,559,941

360,603,613 358,802,534

The fair value of each reporting unit was estimated by use of the income approach. The methodology used to
test impairment is classified as Level 3 per the fair value hierarchy described in note 16.

The fair value for a reporting unit is determined by discounting five-year cash flow projections (cash flows
beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using perpetuity growth rates). These projections reflect
management’s expectations based on past experience and future estimates of operating performance. The
discount rates are applied to the cash flow projections and are derived from the weighted average cost of
capital for each reporting unit or group of reporting units.

The Company’s discount rates are based on market rates of return, debt to equity ratios, and certain risk
premiums, among other things. The perpetuity growth rates are based on expected economic conditions and a
general outlook for the industry.

An impairment charge is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. No
impairment charges have arisen as a result of the reviews performed as at October 1, 2020. Reasonably
possible changes in key assumptions would not cause the recoverable amount of goodwill to fall below the
carrying amount. As there were no indicators of impairment for any of the reporting units, management has not
updated any of the other impairment calculations as at December 31, 2020.

Less: Current portion of ADG Acquisition – earn-out (4,688,553) (7,529,962)

Non-current portion of ADG Acquisition – earn-out - 7,304,105

A portion of the purchase price payable in respect of the ADG Acquisitions in 2019, specifically for SFL
Radiology Holdings, LLC (Georgia business), was subject to an earn-out (the ADG Acquisition – earn-out
liability) based on its annualized revenues earned in the first two quarters of 2020 less certain costs including
certain operating expenses, capital expenditures and incremental working capital. In accordance with the
purchase agreement, 50% of this liability was settled in the latter half of 2020 and the balance is expected to be
settled in the first half of 2021.

The value of the ADG Acquisition – earn-out liability was estimated by management using a probability
weighted valuation technique related to information including revenue and operating expenses; changes in the
fair value of this liability are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive
income (loss). Management estimated the fair value of the ADG Acquisition – earn-out liability as at May 31,
2019 at approximately $14.7 million based on a discount rate of approximately 7% and management’s
estimated probability weighted range of the ADG Acquisition – earn-out liability (it is considered a Level 3
liability as described in note 16; this liability was subsequently settled as noted below). An increase in the
discount rate by 1.0% point decreased the value of this liability by about $0.2 million and vice versa.
Subsequently, the ADG Acquisition – earn-out liability estimate was revalued at approximately $14.8 million as
at December 31, 2019. This liability was revalued at approximately $9.4 million based on a settlement reached
pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement in November 2020 with the representatives of the sellers of
the Company’s Georgia business and the change in fair value was recognized in financial instruments
revaluation in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Fifty percent of this
liability was paid in November 2020 and the balance is to be paid in May 2021 pursuant to the process outlined
in the related purchase agreement. During the twelve month period ended December 31, 2020, the Company
recognized a gain of approximately $5.5 million due to changes in fair value of the ADG Acquisition – earn-out
liability (2019 – loss of approximately $0.1 million).

and conditions); failure to comply, within appropriate period, with obligations under certain covenants or
any provision in the 2025 Senior Notes indenture; certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency and if any
Guarantee by a Significant Subsidiary is held in a judicial proceeding to be unenforceable or invalid. The
occurrence of an event of default would permit the Trustee or holders of at least 25% of the 2025 Senior
Notes to declare all of the 2025 Senior Notes together with unpaid accrued interest, to be immediately due
and payable and to exercise other default remedies.

**2020 Revolving Facility**

Concurrently with the closing of the 2025 Senior Notes, the Company entered into a new revolving credit
agreement (the 2020 Revolving Credit Agreement) with a US financial institution, as administrative and
collateral agent, and other financial institutions, as lenders, to provide a senior secured revolving credit facility
in an aggregate principal amount of $55 million (the 2020 Revolving Facility, and together with 2025 Senior
Notes, the 2025 Loans), with sub-limits for the issuance of letters of credit and for swingline loans. The 2020
Revolving Facility is secured pari passu with the obligations under the 2025 Senior Notes. The 2020 Revolving
Facility will mature on the date that is five years after the issue date (the 2020 Revolving Facility Maturity Date);
provided that, if more than $50 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Senior Notes is outstanding on
the date that is 181 days prior to the 2020 Revolving Facility Maturity Date, then the 2020 Revolving Facility
Maturity Date shall instead be the date that is 181 days prior to the 2020 Revolving Facility Maturity Date.

The availability of borrowings under the 2020 Revolving Facility is subject to customary terms and conditions.
The 2020 Revolving Facility was undrawn at November 2, 2020 (it is considered a Level 3 liability as described
in note 16). The issuance costs related to this credit facility were approximately $2.0 million (including
approximately $0.9 million related to the prior Revolving Facility since the settlement of the Revolving Facility
was considered debt modification for accounting purposes). These costs are included in security deposits and
other assets in the balance sheet and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2020
Revolving Facility. The annual commitment fee related to the 2020 Revolving Facility is capped at 0.5% of the
aggregate principal amount of $55 million. As at December 31, 2020, the 2020 Revolving Facility had a face
value and amortized cost balance of $nil (2019 - $nil).

2020 Revolving Facility - 
The 2020 Revolving Credit Agreement provides for the following (capitalized terms used below in this note and
not defined elsewhere in these notes have the respective meanings given to them in the 2020 Revolving Credit
Agreement):

   - Interest

The interest rates payable on the 2020 Revolving Facility are as follows: (i) each Eurodollar Rate Loan
bears interest on the outstanding principal amount at Adjusted Eurodollar Rate (effectively, LIBOR) plus
the Applicable Rate; (ii) each Base Rate Loan bears interest on the outstanding principal amount at the
Base Rate (the highest of (a) the Prime Rate, (b) the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Rate plus 0.5%


-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

and (c) one-month Adjusted Eurodollar Rate plus 1.0%) plus the Applicable Rate; and (iii) each Swingline
Loan bears interest on the outstanding principal amount at the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate. Since
no amount has been drawn under the 2020 Revolving Facility as at December 31, 2020, the annualized
effective interest rate under the 2020 Revolving Credit Agreement during the twelve months ended
December 31, 2020 is not applicable (2019 – nil). With respect to interest rate sensitivity as at December
31, 2020, a 1% increase in variable interest rates would have increased interest expense under the 2020
Revolving Facility for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 by $nil (2019 – $nil).

   - Restrictive covenants

In addition to certain covenants, the 2020 Revolving Credit Agreement places limits on the Company’s
ability to declare dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock (including options or warrants), prepay,
redeem or purchase debt, incur liens and engage in sale-leaseback transactions, make loans and
investments, incur additional indebtedness, amend or otherwise alter debt and other material agreements,
engage in mergers, acquisitions and asset sales, enter into transactions with affiliates and alter the
business the Company and the Subsidiaries currently conduct.

   - Financial covenant

The 2020 Revolving Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant related to a leverage ratio that is
tested on the last day of any fiscal quarter (commencing with the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2021)
only if on the last day of any such fiscal quarter, the outstanding amount under the 2020 Revolving Facility
(excluding certain letter of credit obligations) exceeds 30% of the total commitment under the 2020
Revolving Facility of $55 million.

Borrowings under the 2020 Revolving Facility were nil as at December 31, 2020 and therefore did not
exceed 30% of the total commitment under the 2020 Revolving Facility. As a result, the Company is in
compliance with the financial covenant. No event of default under the 2020 Revolving Credit Agreement
had occurred as at December 31, 2020.

   - Events of default

Events of default under the 2020 Revolving Credit Agreement include, among others, failure to pay
principal of or interest on the 2020 Revolving Facility when due, failure to pay any fee or other amount
due, failure of any loan party to comply with any covenants or agreements in the loan documents (subject
to applicable grace periods and/or notice requirements), a representation or warranty contained in the
loan documents is incorrect or misleading in a material respect when made, events of bankruptcy and a
change of control. The occurrence of an event of default would permit the lenders under the 2020
Revolving Credit Agreement to declare all amounts borrowed, together with accrued interest and fees, to
be immediately due and payable and to exercise other default remedies.

**Amended May 2019 Loans**

On June 2, 2020, the Company entered into an amendment to its senior credit agreement which amended the
credit agreement signed effective May 31, 2019 (such amended credit agreement, the Amended May 2019
Credit Agreement). Under the terms of the Amended May 2019 Credit Agreement, the Company received in
May 2019 a term loan A and term loan B (Term Loan A, Term Loan B and collectively, Term Loans) of

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

$66,000,000 and $266,000,000, respectively (face value) and a revolving credit facility of $50,000,000, which
was increased to $69,000,000 on June 2, 2020 (the Revolving Facility, and together with the Term Loans, the
Amended May 2019 Loans). In addition, among other things, the amendment adjusted Akumin’s leverage and
fixed charge ratios for the four quarters ended March 31, 2021, providing the Company with greater flexibility in
its financial ratio covenants. Sixteen million dollars of the Term Loan A was subject to a delayed draw, which
was drawn by the Company in October 2019 to partly finance the West Palm Beach Acquisition. The term of
the Amended May 2019 Loans is five years from May 31, 2019. The Amended May 2019 Loans can be
increased by an additional $100,000,000 subject to certain conditions. The proceeds of the Term Loans were
used during 2019 to settle in accordance with the respective contracts, the Syndicated Loans for $112,482,181,
the principal outstanding under Subordinated Note and related accrued and unpaid interest for $1,596,250,
partly finance the ADG Acquisitions and Deltona Acquisition in May 2019 and pay related debt issuance costs.
On May 31, 2019, management determined the fair value of the Amended May 2019 Loans to be their face
value of $319,300,000 net of debt issuance costs of approximately $14.8 million and a debt modification
accounting adjustment of approximately $1.0 million related to the settlement of the Syndicated Loans. The fair
value of the Amended May 2019 Loans was determined based on management’s estimation of assumptions
that market participants would use in pricing similar liabilities (it is considered a Level 3 liability as described in
note 16). As at December 31, 2019, the Amended May 2019 Loans had a balance of approximately, $338.5
million. In June 2020, the amendment costs related to the Amended May 2019 Credit Agreement were netted
against the balance of the Amended May 2019 Loans. The above-noted amendment to the senior credit
agreement in June 2020 was considered debt modification for accounting purposes. On November 2, 2020, the
Amended May 2019 Loans and related accrued and unpaid interest and costs were settled completely in
accordance with the credit agreement, for approximately $364 million using proceeds of the 2025 Senior Notes.
This settlement of the May 2019 Term Loans was considered debt extinguishment for accounting purposes and
a loss of approximately $18 million was recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive income (loss). The settlement of the Revolving Facility was considered debt modification for
accounting purposes and a cost of approximately $0.9 million was added to the issuance costs of the 2020
Revolving Facility.

revaluation and other (gains) losses”. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company incurred interest
expense of $1,301,854 (2019 - $nil) with respect to this derivative financial instrument. The interest expense was
paid on a monthly basis. The settlement payment with respect to this derivative financial instrument in the
cashflow statement is included in the line “Loan repayments”.

liabilities (it is considered a Level 3 liability as described in note 16; this liability was subsequently settled as
noted below).

In accordance with the terms of the Subordinated Note, the Company used part of the proceeds of the Term
Loans to settle the principal outstanding under the Subordinated Note on May 31, 2019, together with accrued
and unpaid interest, for $1,596,250 (face value of $1,500,000 and accrued interest of $96,250). The Company
also recorded a fair value loss of $6,830 on the extinguishment of the Subordinated Note, which was reflected
in the 2019 consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).

According to the Subordinated Note, the Company was subject to an earn-out liability (Subordinated Note –
Earn-out) of up to $4.0 million during the three-calendar year period beginning on January 1, 2019 and ending
on December 31, 2021 (the Subordinated Note – Earn-out Period), subject to the satisfaction of certain
revenue-based milestones, as follows:

a) The Subordinated Note – Earn-out for any given calendar year during the Subordinated Note – Earn-out
Period shall be equal to 50% of any positive difference calculated by subtracting the Base Revenue
($16,000,000) for such calendar year from the Subordinated Note – Earn-out Revenue (defined below) for
such calendar year.

b) The Subordinated Note – Earn-out Revenue for any calendar year during the Subordinated Note – Earnout Period shall be the gross revenue generated by the centres related to the Tampa Acquisition during
such calendar year.

The value of Subordinated Note – Earn-out has been estimated by management using a probabilityweighted valuation technique; changes in the fair value of this liability are recognized in the consolidated
statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Management estimated the fair value of
Subordinated Note – Earn-out as at May 11, 2018 of $160,790 based on a discount rate of 8.75% and
management’s estimated probability-weighted range of Subordinated Note – Earn-out Revenue during the

comprehensive income (loss) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was $14,137 (2019 –
$1,559,418). The stock-based compensation related to stock options is noted in note 15.

The Company’s effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 22.0% (2019 – (28.38%)).
The tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in the United States and the relative amounts
of income earned in this jurisdiction, which management expects to be fairly consistent in the near term. It
is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year but are not consistent from year to year.
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of
assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amount used for income tax purposes. The
Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are made up of the following components:

Management regularly assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether
sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit use of the existing deferred tax assets in
Canada and the US. Based on management’s assessment of the future profitability of the Company’s
Canadian operations, as at December 31, 2020, a valuation allowance of $2,634,364 (2019 – $2,800,607)
has been recorded to recognize only the portion of the deferred tax asset that is more likely than not to be
realized. Management’s assessment of the future profitability of the Company’s US operations has
determined that the deferred tax assets related to the US operations are more likely than not to be realized
and a valuation allowance against these existing deferred tax assets should not currently be required.

The amount of the deferred tax assets is considered realizable, however, it could be adjusted if estimates
of future taxable income during the carry-forward period are reduced or increased. The Company has
made a significant investment in its US operations and asserts that earnings from such operations will be
indefinitely reinvested in the US. Therefore, determination of unrecognized deferred tax liability on outside
basis differences is not practicable at this time.

The Company has operating loss carry-forwards of $68,755,558(2019 – $16,226,326), of which
$19,742,894 begin to expire in 2036. Of these loss-carryforwards, $49,012,664 do not expire but are
subject to utilization restrictions. The Company also has a Section 163(j) interest expense carryforward of
$24,670,177 (2019 – $1,007,969) which does not expire but is subject to utilization restrictions. Tax years
2017-2019 and 2016-2019 remain subject to examination by the tax authorities in the US and Canada,
respectively.

###### 14 Commitments and contingencies

The Company is party to various legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and
investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business. With respect to these matters, the management


-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

evaluates the developments on a regular basis and accrues a liability when it believes a loss is probable and
the amount can be reasonably estimated. We believe that the amount or any estimable range of reasonably
possible or probable loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our
business and consolidated financial statements. However, the outcome of these matters is inherently uncertain.
Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against the Company for amounts in excess of
management's expectations, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting
period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected.

Commencing during Q1 2020 and continuing through the present and beyond, a pandemic relating to the novel
coronavirus known as COVID-19 occurred causing significant financial market disruption and social dislocation.
The pandemic is dynamic with various cities, counties, states and countries around the world responding or
having responded in different ways to address and contain the outbreak, including the declaration of a global
pandemic by the World Health Organization, a National State of Emergency in the United States and state and
local executive orders and ordinances forcing the closure of non essential businesses and persons not
employed in or using essential services to “stay at home” or “shelter in place”. At this stage, we have no
certainty as to how long the pandemic, or a more limited epidemic, will last, what regions will be most affected
or to what extent containment measures will be applied.

Imaging centers are healthcare facilities and as such are generally considered an essential service and
expected to continue to operate during any epidemic or pandemic. However, there is potential that actions
taken by government, referring physicians or individual actions, in response to containment or avoidance of this
coronavirus could impact a patient’s ability or decision to seek imaging services at a given time which could
have a significant impact on volume at our imaging centers leading to temporary or prolonged staff layoffs,
reduced hours, closures and other cost containment efforts. Further, there is potential that certain services
which are not urgent and can be deferred without significant harm to a patient’s health may be delayed, either
by the Company in response to local laws or good public health practice or voluntarily by the patient. In
addition, there is potential that the outbreak of the coronavirus could impact supply chains, including the
Company’s supply of personal protective equipment, and lead to personnel shortages, each of which could
impact the ability of the Company to safely perform imaging services. It is also possible that social distancing
efforts and sanitization and decontamination procedures could cause delays in the performance of imaging
services. Depending on the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is potential for the
Company to incur incremental credit losses beyond what is currently expected and potential future reduction in
revenue and income and asset impairments.

###### 15 Stock-based compensation – options

The Company operates an equity-settled, stock options based payment compensation plan, under which the
Company pays equity instruments of the Company as consideration in exchange for services received. The fair
value of the grant of options is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive
income (loss) as an expense. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of
the options granted. The total expense is recognized over the vesting period, which is the period over which all
of the service vesting conditions are to be satisfied. The maximum number of common shares reserved for
issuance, in the aggregate, under the Company’s option plan (and under any other share compensation
arrangements of the Company) is 10% of the aggregate number of common shares which are outstanding from
time to time. As at December 31, 2020, this represented 7,017,842 (2019 – 6,984,092) common shares.

During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company did not grant any stock options. During the
twelve months ended December 31, 2019, the Company granted approximately 1.7 million stock options on
November 18, 2019, to purchase common shares on a 1:1 basis with an exercise price of $3.29 per share. The
fair value of the stock options granted during 2019 was determined to be $2.4 million. These options will vest
over a three-year period from the date of issue (34%, 33% and 33% per year, respectively) and have an expiry
date of seven years from the date of issue. The fair value of the stock options granted during the twelve months
ended December 31, 2019 was estimated to be $1.4364 per option using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model based on the following assumptions. The Company granted stock options in March 2021 as discussed in
note 26.

Date of options grant November 18, 2019

Underlying stock price 3.29

Exercise price 3.29

Term of options (years) 7.0

Volatility of underlying stock price 40%

Expected dividend yield on underlying stock nil

Annual risk free interest rate 1.48%

At December 31, 2020, 1.8 million options were outstanding but not yet exercisable with a weighted average
exercise price of $3.46, weighted average remaining contractual term of 5.5 years and weighted average grant
date fair value of approximately $1.4 million. At December 31, 2019, 3.0 million options were outstanding but
not yet exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of $3.49, weighted average remaining contractual
term of 6.4 years and weighted average grant date fair value of approximately $2.2 million.

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the weighted average grant date fair value of stock
options that:
a) vested was $0.9 million (2019 – $0.9 million); and
b) were cancelled was $26 thousand (2019 – $0.1 million).

The total grant date fair value of stock options that vested during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020
was $1.8 million (2019 – $1.7 million).

During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a total stock-based options
compensation expense of approximately $2,069,777 (2019 – $1,995,347). The total compensation cost related
to unvested options awards not yet recognized is approximately $1,089,614 (2019 – $3,185,813) and will be
recognized over a remaining vesting period of 1.88 years (2019 – 2.88 years).

###### 16 Risk management arising from financial instruments

The carrying value of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities and leases (current
portion) approximates their fair value given their short-term nature.

The carrying value of the non-current portion of leases approximates their fair value given the difference
between the discount rates used to recognize the liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and the
normalized expected market rates of interest is insignificant. The estimated fair values of other non-current
liabilities were as follows:


**2020**

**$**


**2019**

**$**


2025 Senior Notes 424,016,044   
Amended May 2019 loans payable   - 360,596,500

Derivative financial instruments   - 951,105

429,826,997 378,049,987

Financial instruments recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets are classified using a fair value
hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements. The fair value hierarchy
has the following levels:

- Level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Pricing inputs are
based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the
ability to access at the measurement date. For securities, the valuations are based on quoted prices of the
securities that are readily and regularly available in an active market, and accordingly, a significant degree
of judgment is not required. As at December 31, 2020, the Company did not have any financial assets or
liabilities measured at fair value under the Level 1 category.


-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

   - Level 2 – inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability;
either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices)

Pricing inputs are based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for
identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model based valuation techniques for
which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable
market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. The estimated fair value of the
liabilities that are recognized at fair value, and subsequently measured at amortized cost, are determined
using Level 2 inputs primarily related to comparable market prices. As at December 31, 2020, the 2025
Senior Notes and derivative financial instruments were measured at fair value under the Level 2 category
on recognition. The derivative financial instruments are subsequently remeasured at fair value under the
Level 2 category.

   - Level 3 – inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable
inputs)

Pricing inputs are generally unobservable for the assets or liabilities and include situations where there is
little, if any, market activity for the investment. The inputs into the determination of fair value require
management’s judgment or estimation of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the
assets or liabilities. The fair values are therefore determined using model based techniques that include
option pricing models, discounted cash flow models, and similar techniques.

The Amended May 2019 Loans, Wesley Chapel Loan, Subordinated Note – Earn-out, and ADG Acquisition –
Earn-out were measured at fair value under the Level 3 category on recognition. The ADG Acquisition – Earnout and Subordinated Note – Earn-out were subsequently remeasured at fair value under the Level 3 category.
The Amended May 2019 Loans and Subordinated Note – Earn-out were settled completely during the three
months ended December 31, 2020 as discussed in notes 10 and 11. The liability related to the ADG Acquisition
– Earn-out was determined based on execution of a settlement agreement in November 2020 as discussed in
note 8.

The following table summarizes information regarding the change in carrying value of the Company’s financial
instruments carried at fair value.

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

**Credit risk**

The Company has a diverse mix of payers, including private, managed care, capitated and government payers.
Credit risk arises from the potential a counterparty will fail to perform its obligations. The Company is exposed
to credit risk from customers. The Company grants credit to its customers in the normal course of business.
The consolidated financial statements take into account an allowance for bad debts. The Company is exposed
to credit risk from its customers but the concentration of the risk is minimized because of the large customer
base and its dispersion across different payers. During the year, the Company may have deposits with financial
institutions that exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits. As at December 31, 2020, the Company
had cash of $44,395,988 (2019 – $23,388,916) and accounts receivable of $91,126,923 (2019 – $82,867,225).

Collectability of the receivables is actively monitored on an ongoing basis and an allowance or a write-off of
allowance for bad debts is established by management. At each reporting period, the Company determines
whether an allowance or write-off is required by estimating the expected credit losses based on a combination
of probability-weighted historic and actual bad debts experience with consideration of forward-looking
information including changes to economic conditions that would impact its customers (such as unemployment
rate and general economic environment for non-individual payors). During the period affected by the COVID-19
pandemic, management’s consideration of those changes to economic conditions included the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic.

**Currency risk**

Currency risk is the risk to the Company’s earnings that arises from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and
the degree of volatility of those rates. In the normal course of business, the Company may enter into foreign
exchange contracts with financial institutions to hedge the value of foreign currency denominated assets. Gains
and losses arising from these contracts offset the losses and gains from the underlying hedged transactions. As
at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company did not enter into any foreign exchange contracts
that would expose the Company to currency risk.

**Interest rate risk**

Interest rate risk is the risk the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of
changes in market interest rates. Changes in lending rates can cause fluctuations in interest payments and
cash flows. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments to alter the effects of this risk, except as
noted in note 10. As at December 31, 2020, the Company’s variable interest rate debt only related to the 2020
Revolving Facility (note 10), which was not drawn during 2020.

The following table shows the Company’s exposure to interest rate risk and the effects on comprehensive
income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 of a 1% increase or decrease in the
variable interest rates.

###### 17 Related party transactions

The Company transacts with key individuals including directors and executive management who have authority
and responsibility to plan, direct, and control the activities of the Company.

On November 1, 2020, the Company acquired an MRI machine from an entity in which an officer of a
subsidiary of the Company holds a significant interest for $400,000, which has been paid in full. The MRI
machine is to be installed in one of the Company’s diagnostic imaging facilities in Florida. There are no
ongoing contractual or other commitments resulting from the transaction.

On February 8, 2018, Akumin Corp. entered into a contract with the President and Chief Executive Officer,
Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Secretary
(collectively, the Pledgors) to loan an aggregate of $500,000 in connection with the purchase by such Pledgors
of a total of 142,857 common shares of the Company from certain selling security holders of PMI, pursuant to
the terms of a put and call option agreement made as of August 9, 2017 between Z Strategies Inc., a company
controlled by the President and Chief Executive Officer, and certain selling security holders of PMI. This loan
charged interest at 6% per annum and was payable on maturity at February 8, 2021. During 2019, the Pledgors
completely paid off this loan and accrued interest.

###### 18 New accounting standards

The standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuance of the
Company’s consolidated financial statements are disclosed below. The Company intends to adopt these
standards, if applicable, when they become effective.

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

**ASU 2018-15, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other – Internal Use Software (Topic 350-40)**

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other – Internal-Use Software
_(Topic 350-40). The ASU is intended to improve the recognition and measurement of financial instruments. The_
new guidance aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement
that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or
obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license). This
ASU is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption
permitted. For all other entities, this ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2020. The Company is considered an Emerging Growth Company as classified by SEC, which gives the
Company relief in the timing of implementation of this standard by allowing the private company timing for
adoption. The Company continues to evaluate the impact of the standard on its consolidated financial
statements.

**ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326)**

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326):
_Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, and related clarifying standards, which replaces the_
incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses
and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to assess credit loss
estimates. The ASU is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early
adoption permitted. For all other entities, this ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2022. The Company is considered an Emerging Growth Company as classified by SEC, which gives the
Company relief in the timing of implementation of this standard by allowing the private company timing for
adoption. The Company continues to evaluate the impact of the standard on its consolidated financial
statements.

###### 23 Settlement costs and other (recoveries)

During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company experienced net settlement costs of
approximately $2.3 million (2019 – settlement recoveries of $1.9 million) mainly related to the following items.

i) Approximately, $0.8 million related to a settlement of a government investigation that relates predominantly
to historical reimbursements paid under federal healthcare programs to subsidiaries or the Revenue
Practices. This settlement was reached in January 2021.

ii) Approximately $1.1 million comprised of a few settlement costs related to four vendors.

###### 24 Non-controlling interests

As part of the Texas Acquisition in 2017, certain of PMI’s subsidiaries acquired were non-wholly owned. As a
result of operating agreements with each of those non-wholly owned entities, the Company was deemed to
have control over those entities and thus 100% of their financial results were included in the Company’s
consolidated financial results. The acquired non-controlling interests were recorded in the Company’s
consolidated financial statements at their estimated fair value. In May 2018, the Company purchased the noncontrolling interests in seven Texas-based diagnostic imaging companies. During June 2018, (i) the Company
purchased the non-controlling interests in Toggle, LLC, a transcription company, for de minimis consideration,
and (ii) Preferred Imaging of Tarrant County, LLC, a holding company, distributed its assets to its shareholders
and was subsequently terminated.

The Company currently holds effective ownership interests in the following non-wholly owned entities:

###### 25 CARES Act

i) During April 2020, the Company received approximately $1.1 million in grant under the first appropriation
made by the HHS to Medicare providers pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security
Act (CARES Act). Subsequently, in December 2020, the Company received an additional grant from the
HHS of approximately $4.1 million. Additional grants may be available to the Company through
subsequent appropriations under this program. The Company applied for these grants after determining
that it was eligible to do so. Also, the Company has incurred expenses and experienced loss of revenue
that are eligible to be reimbursed under these grants. The grants received are recorded in the
consolidated statements of operations comprehensive income (loss) in the category “Other revenue”.

ii) During April 2020, the Company received approximately $3.1 million of accelerated Medicare payments

under the expanded Accelerated and Advance Payments Program from Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
Service (CMS). These payments are currently required to be applied to claims beginning one year after
their receipt through the adjudication of Medicare claims over a future period. These payments to the
Company are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets in the category “Accounts payable and accrued
liabilities” until earned.

iii) The CARES Act allows employers to defer the deposit and payment of the employer's share of Social

Security taxes. As of December 31, 2020, such taxes were approximately $2.7 million and approximately
$1.3 million are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets in the category “Accrued payroll taxes” and
the remaining balance in the category “Accounts payable and accrued liabilities”.

###### 26 Subsequent events 

i) The Company announced on February 11, 2021 that it completed its private offering of $75 million
aggregate principal amount of additional 7.00% senior secured notes due November 2025 (the “New
Notes”). The New Notes were offered as additional notes under the same indenture as the previously
issued 2025 Senior Notes and will be treated as a single series with the 2025 Senior Notes.

The Company expects to use the net proceeds from this offering for future acquisitions, with any unused
proceeds to be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes, which may include
reducing debt. The New Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior
secured basis by each wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, including the Revenue Practices and the
guarantors.

ii) Effective March 1, 2021, the Company completed a common equity investment in an artificial intelligence

business as part of a private placement offering for approximately $4.6 million. The target develops
artificial intelligence aided software programs for use in medical businesses, including outpatient imaging
services of the sort provided by the Company. As a result of the investment, a previous investment in a
convertible note instrument issued by the target to the Company in May 2020 converted for common
equity. The Company’s total investment is estimated to be valued at approximately $8.0 million and
represents a 34.5% interest in the target. In addition, the Company holds share purchase warrants which,


-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated)

subject to the occurrence of certain events, and the payment of approximately $0.4 million, would entitle
the Company to acquire a further 2.4% interest in the target’s common equity.

iii) On March 9, 2021, the Board granted 645,000 RSUs and 70,000 options to certain employees and
consultants of the Company pursuant to the Company's RSU plan and stock option plan, respectively, in
connection with the Company's equity bonus awards. In addition, 84,032 RSUs were granted to nonexecutive directors of the Company as part of their 2021 compensation and 50,000 RSUs were awarded
as part of a signing bonus to an executive who started with the Company on March 29, 2021. Subject to
and in accordance with the terms of the RSU plan, 50% of the RSUs granted will vest and settle for
common shares one year after the date of grant and the remaining 50% will vest and settle for common
shares two years after the date of grant. Subject to and in accordance with the stock option plan, the
options were granted with an exercise price of $3.58 per share, representing the 5-day volume weighted
average price of the shares prior to the date of grant and an expiry date of 7 years after the date of grant.
The options granted will vest as follows: 34% of the grant vest one year after the date of grant, 33% two
years after the date of grant and the remaining 33% three years after the date of grant.

**1. Basis of Presentation**

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by Alliance HealthCare Services,
Inc. (the “Company” or “Alliance”) and do not include all of the information and disclosures required by accounting principles
generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”). In the opinion of management, all normal recurring accruals and adjustments considered
necessary for a fair presentation have been included. The results for the three months ended March 31, 2021 are not necessarily
indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2021. The accompanying condensed consolidated
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 (“2020 Annual Report”).

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. On an
ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, provision for the collectibility of
accounts receivable, goodwill and other intangible assets, and assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions.
Actual results could differ from these estimates and such differences could affect the results of operations reported in future periods.

_Pending Acquisition by Akumin Corp._


On June 25, 2021, the Company entered into a share purchase agreement (the “Share Purchase Agreement”) with Akumin


Corp., a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Akumin Inc. Pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement, Akumin Corp. will acquire all
of the issued and outstanding common stock of Thaihot Investment Company US Limited, which owns 100% of the common stock of
Alliance, from Thaihot Investment Co., LTD (the “Seller”). The aggregate purchase price payable to the Seller at closing is
$820 million (the “Purchase Price”).


The transaction is subject to the receipt of certain regulatory approvals, as well as the satisfaction or waiver of other


customary closing conditions. The Share Purchase Agreement provides for the payment by Akumin Corp. of a reverse break fee to the
Seller equal to: (a) 5.0% of the Purchase Price in connection with the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement under certain
circumstances, including a material breach by Akumin Corp. of any covenant, representation or warranty contained in the Share
Purchase Agreement; and (b) 2.5% of the Purchase Price in connection with the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement because
of a failure to obtain certain regulatory approvals by an agreed upon date.


The Company expects the transaction to be completed in the third quarter of 2021.


**2. Recent Accounting Pronouncements**

**Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted**


**_Intangibles - Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software_**


In August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2018

15, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software.” ASU 2018-15 aligns the requirements for deferring implementation
costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs
incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. This ASU is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2020, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. Early adoption is permitted and can be applied
either retrospectively or prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. The Company adopted ASU
2018-15 on January 1, 2021 on a prospective basis. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.

**Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted**

**_Leases_**


In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases,” to increase transparency and comparability among organizations


by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. ASU
2016-02 supersedes the current standard. The primary difference between current guidance and ASU 2016-02 is the recognition of
lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP. ASU 2016-02 also
requires an entity to separate the lease components from the non-lease components (for example, maintenance services or other
activities that transfer a good or service to the customer) in a contract. Only the lease components must be accounted for in accordance
with this guidance. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10, “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326),
Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842): Effective Dates.” ASU 2019-10 deferred the effective date for ASU
2016-02 by one year for smaller reporting companies, non-SEC filers and all other companies. Subsequently, in June 2020, the FASB
issued ASU 2020-05, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) and Leases (Topic 842),” which grants a one-year
effective date deferral. Therefore, ASU 2016-02 is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and
interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. Early adoption continues to be allowed. The Company is
assessing the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-02 may have on its consolidated financial statements.


**_Financial Instruments – Credit Losses_**


In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of


Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for
financial assets held based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the
collectibility of the reported amount. In May 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-05, “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses
(Topic 326): Targeted Transition Relief,” which provides additional implementation guidance on the previously issued ASU
2016-13. These ASUs are effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. Early adoption is
permitted. The Company is assessing the impact that the adoption of these ASUs may have on its consolidated financial
statements.


**_Derivatives and Hedging and Reference Rate Reform_**


In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference


Rate Reform on Financial Reporting,” which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP principles to contracts,
hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued due to
reference rate reform. This guidance was effective beginning on March 12, 2020, and can be adopted on a prospective basis no later
than December 31, 2022, with early adoption permitted. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01, “Reference Rate Reform
(Topic 848).” The objective of the new reference rate reform standard is to clarify the scope of Topic 848 and provide explicit
guidance to help companies applying optional expedients and exceptions. These ASUs are effective immediately for all entities that
have applied optional expedients and exceptions. The Company is assessing the impact, if any, that the adoption of these ASUs may
have on its consolidated financial statements.

The following table summarizes the valuation of the Company’s financial instruments that are reported at fair value on a

The Company’s derivative instruments are primarily pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swaps based on the London
interbank offered rate (“LIBOR”) swap rate (see Note 5). The Company has elected to use the income approach to value these
derivatives, using observable Level 2 market expectations at the measurement date and standard valuation techniques to convert future
amounts to a single present amount assuming that participants are motivated but not compelled to transact. Level 2 inputs for interest
rate swap valuations are limited to quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets (specifically futures contracts on
LIBOR for the first two years) and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (specifically LIBOR
cash and swap rates at commonly quoted intervals and implied volatilities for options). According to Accounting Standards
Codification (“ASC”) 820, “Fair Value Measurement,” the fair value measurement of an asset or liability must reflect the
nonperformance risk of the entity and the counterparty. Therefore, the impact of the counterparty’s creditworthiness and the
Company’s creditworthiness has also been factored into the fair value measurement of the derivative instruments.

During the three months ended March 31, 2021, none of the Company’s instruments has transferred from one level to another.

**_Assets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis_**

The Company measures the fair value of certain assets on a non-recurring basis (utilizing Level 3 inputs), generally on an annual
basis, in connection with acquisitions, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may
not be recoverable. These assets include goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets (see Note 4).  The Company did not make
any such measurements during the three months ended March 31, 2021 or 2020.

As of March 31, 2021, there were no indications of impairment of the Company’s intangible assets.

Other accrued liabilities consist of the following:


The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) provided for qualified healthcare providers to receive


advanced payments under the existing Medicare Accelerated and Advance Payments Program (“MAAPP”) during the COVID-19
pandemic. Under this program, healthcare providers could choose to receive advanced payments for future Medicare services
provided. During 2020, the Company applied for and received approval to receive MAAPP funds from Centers for Medicare &
Medicaid Services. The Company recorded these payments as a liability until all performance obligations have been met, as the
payments were made on behalf of patients before services were provided. MAAPP funds received are required to be applied to future
Medicare billings commencing in April 2021, with all such remaining amounts required to be repaid by September 2022. Included in
other accrued liabilities at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 is $6.1 million of MAAPP funds.


In addition, the CARES Act provided waivers, reimbursement, grants and other funds to assist healthcare providers during the


COVID-19 pandemic, including $100 billion in appropriations for the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund, also
referred to as the Provider Relief Fund, to be used for preventing, preparing, and responding to the coronavirus, and for reimbursing
eligible healthcare providers for lost revenues and healthcare related expenses that are attributable to COVID-19. During 2020, the
Company received $6.6 million of payments (“Relief Funds”) under the CARES Act, of which $6.2 million were recorded in other
income, net in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2020, and $0.4
million were recorded in other accrued liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2021 and December
31, 2020 pending the achievement of certain requirements. The Relief Funds do not have to be repaid.

and December 31, 2020, with 50% of the deferred amount due December 31, 2021 and the remaining 50% due December 31, 2022.
The Company elected to defer depositing the employer’s share of Social Security taxes beginning in April 2020. As of March 31,
2021 and December 31, 2020, $5.7 million related to these deferred payments are included in accrued compensation and related

Company’s controlled joint ventures. The equipment debt outstanding under this arrangement as of March 31, 2021 was $7.1 million.
A waiver was obtained from the equipment lender for the violation of the minimum debt service coverage ratio for the trailing 12month period as of March 31, 2021.

**5. Derivatives and Cash Flow Hedges**

The Company has multiple interest rate swap agreements to hedge the future cash interest payments on portions of its variablerate bank debt in order to avoid volatility in operating results due to fluctuations in interest rates.

The Company established five single-year interest rate swap agreements (“JPM Interest Rate Swaps”) with JPMorgan Chase
Bank, NA, the administrative agent of the First Lien Credit Agreement. The JPM Interest Rate Swaps, which mature on June 30, 2019,
June 30, 2020, June 30, 2021, June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, respectively, have notional amounts of $300.0 million each and were
designated as cash flow hedges of future cash interest payments associated with a portion of the Company’s variable rate debt
included in the Credit Agreements. Under the terms of these swap agreements, the Company receives one-month LIBOR and pays
fixed rates ranging from 2.483% to 3.167% on the notional amounts. The net effect of the hedges is to record interest expense at these
fixed rates plus the applicable margin of the underlying debt.

bank debt or approximately 54% of total variable-rate debt. At December 31, 2020, the Company had interest rate swap agreements to
hedge $307.9 million of its variable-rate bank debt or approximately 54% of total variable-rate debt. The amount that the Company

**6. Stock Appreciation Rights**

During 2018, the Company adopted a long-term incentive program (“2018 LTIP”) pursuant to which certain key management
personnel and non-employee consultants are eligible to receive Stock Appreciation Rights (“SARs”). SARs have 10-year terms and
vest in three equal installments on each of the three anniversaries following the vesting commencement date. SARs are granted with a
base price of not less than 100% of the fair value of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant. Once vested, SARs can be
exercised to acquire shares of the Company’s common stock during the specified annual exercise period. The number of shares to be
issued upon exercise of the SARs is based on the aggregate appreciation of the SARs value, calculated as the difference between the
fair market value of the Company’s common stock as of the specified valuation date preceding the exercise date and the SARs base
price. SARs are subject to accelerated vesting provisions upon certain change in control and other specified events. Upon termination
of employment or service, unvested awards are generally cancelled and vested awards may be exercised for a limited period of time.
Under the plan, up to 750,000 SARs may be granted and SARs that are exercised, forfeited or canceled or otherwise not paid will not
again be available for grant under the plan.

During the three months ended March 31, 2021, 121,657 SARs vested. No SARs were exercised during the three months ended
March 31, 2021. Compensation costs associated with the SARs were not material during the three months ended March 31, 2021 and
2020.

As of March 31, 2021, a total of 383,381 SARs vested and there were no unvested SARs.

**7. Commitments and Contingencies**

**_Purchase Commitments_**

The Company has certain binding purchase commitments primarily for the purchase of equipment from various suppliers. As of
March 31, 2021, the obligations for these future purchase commitments totaled $30.4 million, of which $21.9 million is expected to be
paid during the remaining nine months of 2021 and $8.5 million is expected to be paid in 2022.

**_Leases_**

The Company leases office and warehouse space and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. The office and
warehouse leases generally call for minimum monthly payments plus maintenance and inflationary increases. As of March 31, 2021,
future minimum payments under operating leases are as follows:


**(in thousands)**


Year ending December 31:


2021 (remaining nine months) $ 13,868

2022 17,573

2023 16,059

2024 13,682

2025 9,360

Thereafter 42,196

$ 112,738

Rent expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease term and those renewal periods that are reasonably
assured as determined at lease inception. The Company’s total rental expense, which includes short-term equipment rentals, for the
three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 was $4.5 million and $5.2 million, respectively.

**_Guarantees and Indemnities_**

The Company has applied the disclosure provisions of ASC 460, “Guarantees,” to its agreements that contain guarantee or
indemnification clauses. These disclosure provisions expand those required by ASC 440, “Commitments,” and ASC 450,
“Contingencies,” by requiring a guarantor to disclose certain types of guarantees, even if the likelihood of requiring the guarantor’s
performance is remote. The following is a description of arrangements in which the Company is the guarantor or indemnifies a party.


-----

**NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**

**March 31, 2021**

**(Unaudited)**

In the normal course of business, the Company has made certain guarantees and indemnities, under which it may be required to
make payments to a guaranteed or indemnified party, in relation to certain transactions. The Company indemnifies other parties,
including customers, lessors, and parties to other transactions with the Company, with respect to certain matters. The Company has
agreed to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract, which may
include, for example, litigation or claims arising from a breach of representations or covenants. In addition, the Company has entered
into indemnification agreements with its executive officers and directors and the Company’s bylaws contain similar indemnification
obligations. Under these arrangements, the Company is obligated to indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, its
current or former officers and directors for various amounts incurred with respect to actions, suits or proceedings in which they were
made, or threatened to be made, a party as a result of acting as an officer or director.

It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history
of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments
made related to these indemnifications have been immaterial. At March 31, 2021, the Company has determined that no liability is
necessary related to these guarantees and indemnities.

**_Other Matters_**

The Company from time to time is involved in routine litigation and regulatory matters incidental to the conduct of its business.
The Company believes that resolution of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on its condensed consolidated financial
statements.

**8. Supplemental Statement of Operations Information**

The majority of the Company’s revenues are derived directly from hospitals and healthcare providers and are primarily for
radiology and oncology services (“Wholesale”). To a lesser extent, revenues are generated from direct billings to third-party payers or
patients, which are recorded net of contractual discounts, estimated uncollectible amounts associated with patients, and other
arrangements for providing services at less than established patient billing rates (“Retail”). The following table summarizes the
components of the Company’s revenues:

December 31, 2020, the unpaid balance totaled $0.1 million and $0.4 million, respectively, and is expected to be paid during the
remainder of 2021.

**9. Investment in Unconsolidated Investee**

The Company has direct ownership in one unconsolidated investee at March 31, 2021 and 2020. The Company owns 15% of
this investee and provides management services under a management agreement with the investee. Revenues from the management
agreement were $0.4 million for each of the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020.

The Company provides services as part of its ongoing operations for and on behalf of the unconsolidated investee, which
reimburses the Company for the actual amount of the expenses incurred. The Company records the expenses in cost of revenues and
the reimbursement as revenue in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Reimbursed expenses
related to the Company’s unconsolidated equity investee were $0.2 million and $0.3 million for the three months ended March 31,
2021 and 2020, respectively.

The financial position and results of operations of the unconsolidated investee are not material to the Company’s condensed
consolidated financial statements.

To the Board of Directors of Alliance HealthCare Services, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Alliance HealthCare
Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries, which comprise the consolidated balance sheets as of December

loss, of equity and of cash flows for the years then ended.

**_Management's Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements_**

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant
to the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

**_Auditors’ Responsibility_**

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements based on our
audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material
misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on our
judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated
financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we
consider internal control relevant to the Company's preparation and fair presentation of the
consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant
accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

**_Opinion_**

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Alliance HealthCare Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries
as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**December 31, 2020 and 2019**

**1. Description of the Company and Basis of Financial Statement Presentation**

**_Description of the Company_**

Alliance HealthCare Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company” or “Alliance”) is a leading national provider of
outsourced and joint venture healthcare services to hospitals and healthcare providers. The Company also operates freestanding
outpatient radiology, oncology and interventional healthcare clinics and ambulatory surgical centers that are not owned by hospitals
or providers. Diagnostic imaging services are delivered through the Radiology Division (Alliance Radiology), radiation oncology
services are delivered through the Oncology Division (Alliance Oncology), and interventional and pain management services are
delivered through the Interventional Division (Alliance Interventional). The Company is the nation’s largest provider of advanced
diagnostic mobile imaging services, an industry-leading operator of fixed-site radiology centers, and a leading provider of
stereotactic radiosurgery (“SRS”) nationwide. As of December 31, 2020, the Company operated 559 diagnostic imaging and
radiation therapy systems, including 68 fixed-site imaging centers across the country, and 35 radiation therapy centers and SRS
facilities. With a strategy of partnering with hospitals, health systems and physician practices, the Company provides quality
healthcare services for approximately 1,000 hospitals and healthcare partners in 45 states, where approximately 2,300 Alliance team
members are committed to providing exceptional patient care and exceeding customer expectations. The Company was incorporated
in the state of Delaware on May 27, 1987.

**_Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Financial Statement Presentation_**

The audited consolidated financial statements of the Company include the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of all
subsidiaries over which the Company exercises control. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The Company evaluates
participating rights in its assessment of control in determining consolidation of joint venture partnerships. The Company records
noncontrolling interest related to its consolidated subsidiaries that are not wholly-owned. Investments in non-consolidated investees
over which it exercises significant influence but does not control are accounted for under the equity method and are included in other
assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“generally accepted accounting principles” or “GAAP”).

The Company has evaluated events subsequent to December 31, 2020 through March 15, 2021, the date the consolidated
financial statements were available to be issued.

Since 2017, the Company has been controlled by Tahoe Investment Group Co., Ltd., an entity organized under the laws of the

People’s Republic of China (“Tahoe”). Tahoe, through certain wholly-owned subsidiaries, owns 19,250,000 of the Company’s
common stock. During 2020, Tahoe transferred its ownership interest in the Company to Tahoe Healthcare Management Limited, an
entity under common control.

**_Prior Period Adjustment_**

The consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, not presented herein, were audited by
other independent auditors, whose report dated March 29, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. The
Company has revised the December 31, 2018 consolidated financial statements to reflect the correction of an error related to the
accounting for the tax effects of an outside basis difference in two joint ventures that resulted in an understatement of deferred tax
assets that should have been recognized as a deferred tax benefit through the consolidated statement of operations in periods prior to
2018 to conform with generally accepted accounting principles. As a result of this correction, accumulated deficit has been reduced
and deferred tax assets increased by $2.4 million to the previously reported December 31, 2018 balances. The Company determined
that the error was not material to any previously issued consolidated financial statements.

**_COVID-19_**

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared a novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) a pandemic and
recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant volatility and
uncertainty, which has resulted in a prolonged economic downturn that has disrupted and is expected to continue to disrupt the
Company’s business. As of December 31, 2020, the virus continues to spread and many countries are experiencing a resurgence in


-----

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**

**December 31, 2020 and 2019**

infection rates. Although vaccines have recently been approved for use, the availability and distribution of the vaccines continue to
provide challenges to the control of the virus.

During 2020, many of the Company-owned and customer operating sites were impacted by temporary closures or reduced
operating hours. As a result, the Company experienced a reduction in procedure volumes and corresponding revenues. The Company
cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate length or severity of this pandemic, nor the impact on its future procedure volumes and
revenues. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic ultimately impacts the Company’s business, financial condition, results of
operations, cash flows, and liquidity may differ from management’s current estimates due to inherent uncertainties regarding the
duration and further spread of the outbreak, its severity, actions taken to contain the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and to
what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume.

In response to this market condition, the Company took a number of actions in 2020 to mitigate the impact to the Company’s
future results of operations and cash flows, as well as to protect its financial position. These actions included, but are not limited to,
the following:

   - Furloughed, reduced the hours for or eliminated the positions of a substantial number of employees;

   - Reduced compensation for executive and management employees;

   - Implemented certain other cost reductions;

   - Deferred spending on capital expenditures; and

   - Borrowed on its revolving loan facility as a precautionary measure to increase the Company’s cash position and help
maintain financial flexibility.

In addition, the Company entered into amendments to its Credit Agreements (see Note 7) during 2020. The amendments
provided for, among other things, the amendment to certain financial covenants. As a result of the actions taken by the Company and
its projected operating results, management expects that the Company will be in compliance with the debt covenants under the Credit
Agreements for at least the next twelve months.

On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) was signed into law. The
CARES Act includes, among other things, a number of benefits that are applicable to the Company and other healthcare providers,
provisions relating to the deferment of the employer portion of social security tax payments, as well as changes to federal income tax
law including increases to the limit on the deduction for net interest expense and acceleration of the timing for refunds of alternative
minimum tax credits. In addition, the Company received payments in connection with certain provisions of the CARES Act
including: (i) advanced Medicare payments and (ii) government grants to compensate for healthcare related expenses or lost revenues
[attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic (see Note 6). On December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 was signed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_Appropriations_Act,_2021)
into law, which provided additional stimulus relief and renewed some CARES Act programs that had expired.

**2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies**

**_Cash and Cash Equivalents_**

The Company classifies short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less as cash equivalents.

**_Accounts Receivable_**

The Company provides shared and single-user diagnostic imaging and oncology equipment and technical support services to
the healthcare industry and directly to patients on an outpatient basis. Substantially all of the Company’s accounts receivable are due
from hospitals, other healthcare providers and health insurance providers, including Medicare, located throughout the U.S. A
substantial portion of the Company’s services are provided pursuant to long-term contracts with hospitals and other healthcare
providers or directly to patients. Estimated credit losses are provided for in the consolidated financial statements.


-----

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**

**December 31, 2020 and 2019**

Accounts receivable are reported at realizable value, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, which are estimated and recorded
in the period the related revenue is recorded. The Company has a standardized approach to estimate and review the collectability of
its receivables based on a number of factors, including the age of the receivable balances. Changes to the allowance for doubtful
accounts estimates are recorded as an adjustment to bad debt expense within selling, general and administrative expenses in the
consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. Receivables deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the
allowance for doubtful accounts at the time such receivables are written-off.

**_Concentration of Credit Risk_**

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk principally consist of cash, cash
equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company maintains its cash in high-credit-quality financial institutions. Cash and cash
equivalents in excess of federally insured limits were $20.0 million and $15.7 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

The Company’s accounts receivable are primarily from clients in the healthcare industry and third-party payers. No individual
customer represented more than 10% of the Company’s accounts receivable at December 31, 2020 and 2019. To reduce credit risk,
the Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers but does not generally require advance payments or collateral.
Credit losses from customers in the healthcare industry have not been material.

**_Property and Equipment_**

The majority of the Company’s property and equipment is stated at cost and is depreciated using the straight-line method over
the following estimated useful lives:


**Estimated Useful Life**


Major equipment 2 to 10 years

Transportation and service equipment 3 to 10 years

Office equipment 2 to 7 years

Furniture and fixtures 5 to 10 years


Tenant improvements


Shorter of the lease term or

estimated useful life


Buildings 7 years

Routine maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major repairs and purchased software and hardware
upgrades, which extend the life of or add value to the equipment, are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining useful life.

**_Assets Held Under Capital Leases_**

Assets held under capital leases are recorded at the lower of the net present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair
value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease. Amortization expense is recognized using the straight-line method generally
over the estimated useful life of the asset and is included in depreciation expense in the consolidated statement of operations and
comprehensive loss.

**_Goodwill and Intangible Assets_**

Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 350, “Intangibles – Goodwill and Other,” requires that goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but instead tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level. In addition,
ASC 350 defines a reporting unit as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (also known as a component). A
component of an operating segment is a reporting unit under ASC 350 if the component constitutes a business for which discrete
financial information is available and reviewed by management. The Company has evaluated ASC 350 and concluded there are three
operating segments: Radiology, Oncology and Interventional. The Company has assessed that each component listed above meets the
definition of a reporting unit based on the conclusions that each component constitutes a business, discrete financial information is
available for each component, and management regularly reviews the results of such financial information.


-----

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**

**December 31, 2020 and 2019**

In accordance with ASC 350, the Company performs an annual impairment test in the fourth quarter for goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not
reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Such indicators include a significant decline in expected future
cash flows due to changes in company-specific factors or the broader business climate.

In evaluating goodwill for impairment, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likelythan-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company concludes that it is more-likely-thannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company conducts a quantitative goodwill impairment
test. First, for each reporting unit, the Company compares its estimated fair value with its net book value. If the estimated fair value
exceeds its net book value, goodwill is deemed not to be impaired, and no further testing is necessary. If the estimated fair value does
not exceed its net book value, goodwill is deemed to be impaired. The Company records an impairment charge for the amount by
which the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value.

The quantitative impairment analysis utilizes two primary approaches to calculate the fair value of the reporting unit: the
discounted cash flow (“DCF”) method and the Guideline Public Company (“GPC”) method.

Under the DCF method, fair value is measured as the present worth of anticipated future net cash flows generated by a business. In
a multi-period model, net cash flows attributable to a business are forecast for an appropriate period and then discounted to present value
using an appropriate discount rate. In a single-period model, net cash flow or earnings for a normalized period are capitalized to reach a
determination of present value. The methods, key assumptions, degree of uncertainty associated with the key assumptions and the
potential events or changes in circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the key assumptions with respect to
the reporting unit are the estimated future net cash flows generated and the discount rate applied to capture the associated risks. The
ability to achieve anticipated future net cash flows is subject to numerous assumptions and risks, including company-specific risks such
as the ability to maintain and grow revenues, maintain or improve operating margins, control costs and anticipate working capital
requirements. The anticipated future net cash flows are also dependent on industry-level factors, such as the impact of legislature, on
patient volumes and cost-reimbursement levels and continued availability of qualified doctors and other medical professionals who are
necessary to staff the Company’s operations, among other potential impacts.

Under the GPC method, value is estimated by comparing the subject company to similar companies with publicly-traded
ownership interests. Guideline companies are selected based on comparability to the subject company, and valuation multiples are
calculated and applied to subject company operating data. The key assumption used in connection with the GPC method focuses on
identifying guideline companies that operate in the same (or similar) line of business as the reporting units with the same (or similar)
operating characteristics. Eligible companies are selected based on Global Industry Classification Standard codes, Standard Industrial
Classification codes, company descriptions, and industry affiliations. Considered factors include relative risk, profitability, and growth
considerations of the reporting unit relative to the guideline companies. Value estimates for the reporting unit involve using multiples of
market value of invested capital excluding cash to revenue and earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization
(“EBITDA”). Valuations derived using the GPC method rely on information primarily obtained from available industry market data and
publicly available filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

In testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether
it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If the Company
concludes that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, the
Company conducts a quantitative impairment test, which consist of a comparison of the fair value to its carrying amount. If the
carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.

Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis and are reviewed
for impairment in accordance with ASC 360, “Property, Plant, and Equipment.”

**_Impairment of Long-Lived Assets_**

The Company accounts for long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of ASC 360, which requires that long-lived
assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to
undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated


-----

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**

**December 31, 2020 and 2019**

undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset
exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to
sell.

**_Purchase Accounting_**

In accordance with GAAP, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquired business are recorded at their estimated
fair values on the date of acquisition. The difference between the purchase price amount and the net fair value of assets acquired and
liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill if it exceeds the estimated fair value and as a bargain purchase gain if it is below the
estimated fair value. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment, often
utilizes independent valuation experts and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and
amounts of future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, market prices and asset lives, among other items. The judgments made
in the determination of the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as the estimated useful
life of each asset and the duration of each liability, can materially impact the financial statements in periods after acquisition, such as
through depreciation and amortization expense.

Acquisitions of entities over which the Company exercises control have been recorded using the acquisition method of
accounting and, accordingly, results of their operations have been included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of
the effective date of each respective acquisition.

**_Revenue Recognition_**

On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted the new revenue recognition standard issued by the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) and codified in the ASC as topic 606 (“ASC 606”). The revenue recognition standard in ASC 606 outlines a single
comprehensive model for recognizing revenue when (or as) performance obligations, defined in a contract with a customer as goods
or services transferred to the customer in exchange for consideration, are satisfied. In addition, ASC 606 provides implementation
guidance on several other important topics, including the accounting for certain revenue-related costs. The standard also requires
expanded disclosures regarding the Company’s revenue recognition policies and significant judgments employed in the
determination of revenue.

The majority of the Company’s revenues are derived directly from hospitals and healthcare providers and are primarily for
radiology and oncology services (“Wholesale”). To a lesser extent, revenues are generated from direct billings to third-party payers
or patients, which are recorded net of contractual discounts, estimated uncollectible amounts associated with patients, and other
arrangements for providing services at less than established patient billing rates (“Retail”). The following table summarizes the
components of the Company’s revenues:

**Year Ended December 31,**

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**

**December 31, 2020 and 2019**

Pursuant to ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue in the period in which performance obligations are satisfied by
transferring goods or services to customers. The Company records the amount of revenue that reflects the consideration that it
expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company applies the following five-step model in order to determine
this amount: (i) identification of the contract with a customer; (ii) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract and
determination of whether they represent performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract;
(iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to
the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation.

The Company applied the modified retrospective approach when adopting ASC 606 and applied the practical expedient
permitted under ASC 606 to those contracts that were not completed as of the date of initial adoption. Under the modified
retrospective approach, the Company recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard as an adjustment to opening
retained earnings at the date of initial application. The Company was required to capitalize costs to acquire new contracts, whereas
previously, the Company expensed those costs as incurred. As a result, as of January 1, 2019, the Company capitalized $1.3 million
($1.0 million net of tax) of deferred sales commissions related to open contracts, which are included in other assets in the
consolidated balance sheet, and are amortized over the remaining weighted average contract term of three years. Sales commissions
for contracts obtained after December 31, 2018 are capitalized and amortized over the service period of the respective contract. For
the year ended December 31, 2019, the impact of recording sales commission expense under ASC 606 was not materially different
from what would have been recorded under legacy GAAP. In addition, as a result of adopting ASC 606, uncollectible balances
associated with patient responsibility from the Company’s Retail operations are now reflected as implicit price concessions (as
defined in ASC 606) and therefore included as a reduction to net revenues whereas historically these amounts were classified as bad
debt expense and included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations and
comprehensive loss. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded $1.6 million of implicit price concessions as a
direct reduction of net revenues that would have been recorded as bad debt expense prior to the adoption of ASC 606. Other than
these changes in presentation on the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss, the
adoption of ASC 606 did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December
31, 2019.

Wholesale

Wholesale revenues are derived from services provided under an outsourced contract arrangement with hospitals, physician
groups and other healthcare providers. Under outsourced service contracts with wholesale customers, the Company provides medical
services to patients at a fixed site facility or mobile unit. The Company typically bundles its services in providing diagnostic imaging
or radiation therapy services, staffing, supplies and other patient related administrative tasks depending on the customers’ needs. The
majority of the Company’s contracts have a single performance obligation, as a series of distinct services that are substantially the
same are provided and are transferred with the same pattern to the customer. The Company bills customers either on a fee per
procedure, percentage of collections, or fixed-payment methodology. Service fees based on fee per procedure and fixed-payment
methodology are negotiated and agreed upon by both parties. The Company does not have a business practice of accepting less than
contractual amounts. Any amounts not collected do not represent implicit price concessions and instead are due to general credit risk
and therefore, Company treats the allowance for doubtful accounts related to these arrangements as bad debt expense, which is
recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. For
service fees based on a percentage of collections, the Company receives payment after the hospital and other healthcare provider
customers are paid by third-party payers and patients. Revenue is recognized over time as medical services are provided and the
measurement of the transaction price is generally consistent with the methodology used with Retail customers (see Retail below).

For the majority of its wholesale contracts, the Company has the right to invoice the customer in an amount that directly
corresponds with the value to the customer of the Company’s performance to date. The Company uses the practical expedient under
ASC 606 to recognize revenue corresponding with amounts it has the right to invoice for services performed.

Retail

Retail revenues are generated from freestanding facilities managed and operated by the Company, who submit billings and
collect fees directly from the patients and third-party payers that are managed by the center. The Company’s performance obligations
are to provide outpatient medical services to patients, such as diagnostic services, radiation therapy, pain management treatment, or
the provision of goods and services during a patient visit. Revenues are recorded during the period the obligations to provide medical


-----

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**

**December 31, 2020 and 2019**

services are satisfied. Performance obligations for medical services are generally satisfied over a period of less than one day. The
contractual relationships with patients, in most cases, also involve a third-party payer (Medicare, Medicaid, managed care health
plans and commercial insurance companies, including plans offered through the health insurance exchanges) and the transaction
prices for the services provided are dependent upon the terms provided by (Medicare and Medicaid) or negotiated with (managed
care health plans and commercial insurance companies) the third-party payers. The payment arrangements with third-party payers for
the services the Company provides to the related patients typically specify payments at amounts less than standard charges and
generally provide for payments based upon predetermined rates per diagnostic services or discounted fee-for-service rates. Uninsured
patients are billed based on established patient fee schedule or fees negotiated. Management continually reviews the contractual
estimation process to consider and incorporate updates to laws and regulations and the frequent changes in contractual terms resulting
from contract renegotiations and renewals.

Revenue recorded is based upon the estimated amounts the Company expects to be entitled to receive from patients and thirdparty payers. Estimates of contractual adjustments under managed care and commercial insurance plans are based upon the payment
terms specified in the related contractual agreements. Revenues related to uninsured patients, uninsured copayment, and deductible
amounts for patients who have healthcare coverage may have discounts applied (uninsured discounts and contractual discounts). The
Company also records estimated implicit price concessions (based primarily on historical collection experience) related to uninsured
accounts to record self-pay revenues at the estimated amounts ultimately expected to be collected. The Company considers all readily
available information when preparing its estimates.

As part of its adoption of ASC 606, the Company elected the available practical expedient to recognize revenue using the
portfolio approach as the Company does not expect the financial statement effects of this approach to materially differ from an
individual contract approach.

Other

For certain contracts, the Company generates revenue from the rental of equipment and accounts for such contracts as
operating leases. The revenue for these arrangements is recognized over the term of the related contract based on the use of the asset
and at the amounts expected to be collected. In addition, the Company also records revenue from management services that it
performs based upon management service contracts with predetermined pricing and records such revenues in the period in which the
service is performed and at the amounts expected to be collected.

No single customer accounted for more than 10% of consolidated revenues during the years ended December 31, 2020 and
2019.

**_Share-based Compensation_**

Share-based compensation expense is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with ASC 718,
“Compensation—Stock Compensation.” The Company uses the Black-Scholes pricing model to value the compensation expense
associated with share-based awards. Share-based compensation is recognized for the portion of the award that is ultimately expected
to vest and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.

**_Derivatives_**

The Company accounts for derivative instruments and hedging activities in accordance with the provisions of ASC 815,
“Derivatives and Hedging.” On the date the Company enters into a derivative contract, management may designate the derivative as a
hedge of the identified exposure. The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items,
as well as the risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. In this documentation, the
Company specifically identifies the firm commitment or forecasted transaction that has been designated as a hedged item and states
how the hedging instrument is expected to hedge the risks related to the hedged item. The Company formally measures effectiveness
of its hedging relationships at hedge inception in accordance with its risk management policy. The Company’s derivatives are
recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.

Effective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2017-12, "Targeted Improvements to
Accounting for Hedging Activities" (ASU 2017-12). As a result of the adoption of ASU 2017-12, the Company updated its


-----

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**

**December 31, 2020 and 2019**

Derivatives and Hedging accounting policies. See below for additional details related to the adoption of ASU 2017-12. Prior to the
adoption of ASU 2017-12, for derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges, the Company was required to separately measure and
reflect the amount by which the hedging instrument did not offset the changes in the cash flows of hedged items, which was referred
to as the ineffective amount. The Company assessed hedge effectiveness at each reporting period and recorded the gain or loss related
to the ineffective portion of derivative instruments, if any, in interest expense, net, in the consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive loss. Pursuant to the provisions of ASU 2017-12, the Company is no longer required to separately measure and
recognize hedge ineffectiveness. Upon adoption of ASU 2017-12, the Company no longer recognizes hedge ineffectiveness in its
consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, but instead recognizes the entire change in the fair value of cash flow
hedges in other comprehensive loss. The amounts recorded in other comprehensive loss are subsequently reclassified to earnings in
the same line item in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as impacted by the hedged item when the
hedged item affects earnings. In addition, the Company has elected to assess the effectiveness of its hedging relationships
qualitatively in subsequent reporting periods after the initial quantitative assessment as permitted by the new standard.

**_Income Taxes_**

The provision for income taxes is determined in accordance with ASC 740, “Income Taxes.” Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying
enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Future income tax benefits are
recognized only to the extent that the realization of such benefits is considered to be more likely than not. The Company regularly
reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance, when it is more likely than not that such
deferred tax assets will not be recoverable, based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, and the expected
timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences.

**_Fair Values of Financial Instruments_**

The Company uses the following methods and assumptions in estimating fair value disclosure for financial instruments:

   - **Cash and cash equivalents: The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value due to the short-**
term maturity or variable rates of these instruments.

   - **Debt: The carrying amounts of debt are recorded at historical cost. The carrying amounts of variable-rate borrowings**
approximate fair value estimates based on current market rates and credit spreads for similar debt instruments.

   - **Derivative instruments: Fair value is determined based on the income approach and standard valuation techniques to**
convert future amounts to a single present amount and approximates the net gains and losses that would have been
realized if the contracts had been settled at each period-end.

ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurement,” applies to all assets and liabilities that are being measured and reported at fair value on a
recurring basis. ASC 820 requires disclosure that establishes a framework for measuring fair value by establishing a hierarchy for
ranking the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values. ASC 820 requires that assets and liabilities carried
at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:

**Level 1** Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

**Level 2** Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs, including identical securities in inactive markets or similar
securities in active markets that are corroborated by market data; or

**Level 3** Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.

**_Self-Insurance_**

The Company has purchased large deductible insurance policies for its workers’ compensation, auto liability, general liability,
and professional liability exposures. The Company currently retains the first $0.5 million of loss for workers’ compensation, $0.3
million for auto liability and $0.1 million for general and professional liability.

The Company’s policy is to accrue amounts equal to the actuarially estimated costs to settle open claims of insureds, as well as
an estimate of the cost of insured claims that have been incurred but not reported. The Company develops information about the size


-----

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**

**December 31, 2020 and 2019**

of the ultimate claims based on historical experience, current industry information and actuarial analysis, and evaluates the estimates
for claim loss exposure on an annual basis.

The Company believes that adequate provision has been made in the consolidated financial statements for these liabilities. The
most significant assumptions used in the estimation process include determining the trend in costs, the expected cost of claims
incurred but not reported and the expected costs to settle or pay damage awards with respect to unpaid claims. Recorded liabilities are
based upon estimates, and while management believes the estimates of loss are reasonable, the ultimate liability may be in excess of
or less than the recorded amounts.

**_Advertising Costs_**

The Company expenses all advertising costs as incurred. Advertising costs were $1.1 million and $2.2 million for the years
ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

**_Use of Estimates_**

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could
differ from those estimates. The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced significant additional uncertainty with respect to estimates,
judgments and assumptions, which may materially impact our estimates.

**_Comprehensive Income_**

The Company reports comprehensive income in accordance with ASC 220, “Comprehensive Income.” The Company has
multiple interest rate swap agreements to hedge the future cash interest payments on portions of its variable-rate debt. Any unrealized
gains and losses related to the swaps that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting are classified as a component of comprehensive
income, net of taxes.

**_Segment Reporting_**

Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is
evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing
performance. In accordance with ASC 280, “Segment Reporting,” and based on the nature of the financial information that is
received by the CODM, the Company operates in three reportable segments: Radiology, Oncology and Interventional. Each of these
segments, on a stand-alone basis, provides and makes available its respective medical services in similar settings and operates within
a singular regulatory environment. Further, management assesses the Company’s segment operations and each segment’s degree of
efficiency and performance based on this structure of financial reporting and primarily makes operating decisions from these
reportable segment results. All intercompany revenues, expenses, payables and receivables are eliminated in consolidation and are
not reviewed when evaluating segment performance. Each segment’s performance is evaluated based on revenue and Adjusted
EBITDA. There is no aggregation of operating segments in the Company’s determination of reportable segments.

**Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted**


**_Derivatives and Hedging_**


In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, “Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to

Accounting for Hedging Activities,” which was designed to refine and expand hedge accounting for both financial (e.g., interest rate)
and commodity risks. Its provisions create more transparency around how economic results are presented, both on the face of the
financial statements and in the notes thereto. It also makes certain targeted improvements to simplify the application of hedge
accounting guidance. The Company adopted ASU 2017-12 during the year ended December 31, 2020. In accordance with the
transition provisions of ASU 2017-12, the Company is required to eliminate the separate measurement of ineffectiveness for its cash
flow hedging instruments existing as of the adoption date through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the
Application Date (as defined in ASU 2017-12). The Company did not record a cumulative effect adjustment to eliminate


-----

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**

**December 31, 2020 and 2019**

ineffectiveness amounts as all such amounts were not material. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.


In October 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-16, “Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Inclusion of the Secured Overnight


Financial Rate (SOFR) Overnight Index Swap (OIS) Rate as a Benchmark Interest Rate for Hedge Accounting Purposes,” which
expands the list of U.S. benchmark interest rates permitted in the application of hedge accounting to include the Overnight Index
Swap (“OIS”) rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”). SOFR is a new index calculated by reference to shortterm repurchase agreements backed by Treasury securities. It was selected as a preferred replacement for U.S. dollar London
Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), which will be phased out by June of 2023. The amendments in this ASU are required to be adopted
concurrently with the amendments in ASU 2017-12. The Company adopted this ASU concurrently with ASU 2017-12 during the
year ended December 31, 2020, but will continue to use LIBOR while available. The adoption did not have a material impact on the
Company’s consolidated financial statements.


**_Fair Value Measurements_**


In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework Changes to the

Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement.” This standard modifies certain disclosure requirements on fair value
measurements. ASU 2018-13 is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim
periods within those years. The Company adopted ASU 2018-13 during the year ended December 31, 2020. The adoption did not
have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.


**_Income Taxes_**


In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income


Taxes,” which is intended to simplify various aspects related to accounting for income taxes. ASU 2019-12 removes certain
exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and also clarifies and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application.
ASU 2019-12 is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within fiscal year
beginning after December 15, 2022. Early adoption is permitted. The Company early adopted the standard effective January 1,
2020. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

**3. Transactions**


**_e+CancerCare_**


In January 2018, the Company entered into a definitive acquisition agreement to acquire e+CancerCare, a leading provider of
cancer care services in the U.S., from Kohlberg & Company, L.L.C. and various other equity holders. Completion of the transaction
was subject to satisfaction or waiver of various financial, regulatory and other conditions. The Company had expected to fund a large
portion of the acquisition with an equity investment from Tahoe. In addition, in connection with the proposed acquisition, the
Company entered into an agreement outlining its intent to establish an incremental term facility of $100 million (“Incremental Term
Facility”), under the Company’s existing credit agreements, to finance a portion of the acquisition. Under the terms of the agreement
related to the Incremental Term Facility, the Company agreed to pay certain ticking fees to the administrative agent for the account of
the lenders in the syndicate until the debt was funded.

In March 2019, the agreement to acquire e+CancerCare was terminated due to challenges in executing upon the anticipated
equity funding from Tahoe. Pursuant to the terms in the agreement, the Company paid a termination fee of $11.0 million to the equity
holders of e+CancerCare in March 2019, which was recorded in transaction costs in the consolidated statement of operations and
comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition, the Company terminated the Incremental Term Facility and
paid all ticking fees incurred through the termination date, which totaled $4.2 million, in March 2019.


**_Acquisition of Molecular Imaging Technologies, LLC_**


On September 15, 2020, the Company through its Radiology Division, completed the purchase of 100% membership interest in
three radiology centers and a 51% membership interest in a fourth radiology center from Molecular Imaging Technologies, LLC
(“MIT”). The purchase price for this acquisition was $7.4 million and was funded with proceeds from the Company’s existing cash

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**

**December 31, 2020 and 2019**

balance. The estimated fair value of the identifiable assets acquired at the acquisition date was $6.5 million, including identifiable
intangible assets of $5.4 million. The excess purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired was $1.4 million and was
recorded in goodwill. The amounts recorded for goodwill and intangible assets are being amortized over 15 years for tax purposes.
Acquired intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The fair values of the identifiable
intangible assets were estimated using a valuation methodology representing Level 3 fair value measurements.

The values assigned to the identifiable intangible assets acquired are preliminary and may be subject to adjustment upon the

final determination of their respective fair values.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, the post-acquisition results associated with the MIT acquisition include net
revenues and income before income taxes of $1.4 million and $0.3 million, respectively.


**_Disposition of Alliance Interventional, LLC_**


On December 31, 2020, the Company sold its 77.28% membership interest in Alliance Interventional, LLC (“AI”) to its joint
venture partners (“AI Sale”) who owned the remaining 22.72% membership interest. AI is the sole owner of The Pain Center of
Arizona (“TPC”). Prior to the AI Sale, AI owned 60% of the membership interests in Alliance Interventional-Florida, LLC (“AHIPFL”). Prior to the AI Sale, the joint venture partners of AI assigned their indirect membership interest in AHIP-FL to the Company so
that AI no longer had a membership interest in AHIP-FL. In connection with the joint venture partners’ assignment of their indirect
ownership in AHIP-FL, the Company reclassified $2.2 million from noncontrolling interest to additional paid-in capital, which
primarily represents the accumulated deficit allocated to the assigned noncontrolling interest.

The total consideration received for the AI Sale was $15.0 million, consisting of $1.25 million in cash paid at closing and a
$13.75 million promissory note due from the joint venture partners. The promissory note requires various principal payments during
its term and is due on December 31, 2023. The promissory note bears interest at an annual interest rate of 9% through December 31,
2022 and 10% from January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2023. The promissory note is collateralized by a first priority security
interest in all assets of AI and subsidiaries and secured by a pledge from the joint venture partners of a first priority security interest
in their equity interests in AI.

As a result of the sale, the Company wrote-off $15.2 million related to the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest, $17.3
million of intangible assets, and $8.4 million related to goodwill allocated to the disposed business. The Company recognized a gain
on sale of $0.3 million, which was recorded in other income, net in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss
for the year ended December 31, 2020.


**_Other_**


In July 2019, the Company sold its interest in a consolidated joint venture for $1.2 million. As a result of the disposition, the
Company wrote-off $1.8 million related to the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest. The net impact to earnings in connection
with the sale was immaterial.

In August 2020, the Company sold substantially all of the assets of a radiology center for $0.5 million. As a result of the
disposition, the Company recognized a gain on sale of $0.4 million, which was recorded in other income, net in the consolidated
statement of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2020.

In November 2020, the Company sold its 50% membership interest in a consolidated joint venture for $2.2 million. As a result
of the disposition, the Company wrote-off $0.2 million related to the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest and $0.2 million
related to goodwill allocated to the disposed business. In addition, the Company recognized a gain on sale of $1.8 million, which was
recorded in other income, net in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31,
2020.

**4. Fair Value of Financial Instruments**

**_Instruments Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis_**

The following table summarizes the valuation of the Company’s financial instruments that are reported at fair value on a
recurring basis:

**Fair Value as of December 31, 2020** **Fair Value as of December 31, 2019**

**(in thousands)** **Total** **Level 1** **Level 2   Level 3** **Total** **[ Level 1  ]** **Level 2** **Level 3**

Financial liabilities:

Interest rate contracts (included in other
accrued liabilities) $ 6,196   $ —   $ 6,196   $ —   $ 4,218   $ —   $ 4,218   $ —

Interest rate contracts (included in other
liabilities) 8,156 — 8,156 — 9,620 —    9,620 —

Total financial liabilities $ 14,352   $ —   $ 14,352   $ —   $ 13,838   $ —   $ 13,838   $ —

The Company’s derivative instruments are primarily pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swaps based on the London
interbank offered rate (“LIBOR”) swap rate (see Note 8). The Company has elected to use the income approach to value these
derivatives, using observable Level 2 market expectations at measurement date and standard valuation techniques to convert future
amounts to a single present amount assuming that participants are motivated but not compelled to transact. Level 2 inputs for interest
rate swap valuations are limited to quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets (specifically futures contracts on
LIBOR for the first two years) and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (specifically LIBOR
cash and swap rates at commonly quoted intervals and implied volatilities for options). According to ASC 820, the fair value
measurement of an asset or liability must reflect the nonperformance risk of the entity and the counterparty. Therefore, the impact of
the counterparty’s creditworthiness and the Company’s creditworthiness has also been factored into the fair value measurement of the
derivative instruments.

None of the Company’s instruments has transferred from one level to another.

**_Assets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis_**

The Company measures the fair value of certain assets on a non-recurring basis (utilizing Level 3 inputs), generally on an
annual basis, in connection with acquisitions, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the
assets may not be recoverable. These assets include goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets (see Notes 5 and 11).

During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company also measured the fair value of the term loans and warrants (utilizing
Level 3 inputs) in connection with the tax treatment of the debt modification resulting from the amendment to the Credit Agreements
(see Note 7).

Balance at December 31, 2020 $ 49,326   $ 44,670   $ —   $ 93,996

The Company tests its goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually or more frequently depending on certain

impairment indicators. There were no interim impairment tests performed. Goodwill was tested for impairment at the reporting unit
level as of October 1, 2020 and October 1, 2019, the dates of the Company’s annual impairment review for the years ended
December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company performed a quantitative test as part of its annual impairment review. In
estimating fair values, the Company used a combination of the income approach (the DCF method) and the market approach (the GPC
method).

Specifically, the Company utilized the following Level 3 estimates and assumptions in its analyses:

**October 1, 2020** **October 1, 2019**

Discount rate 10.5% to 12.5% 8.5% to 10.5%

Perpetual growth rate 2.00% 2.00%

Tax rate 25.00% 25.00%

Risk-free rate 1.20% 3.50%

EBITDA multiple 6.5x to 7.0x 6.0x to 7.5x

In both 2020 and 2019, the respective annual impairment tests yielded individual fair values for the Radiology and Oncology
reporting units that exceeded their respective carrying values; therefore, these reporting units were not considered at risk of
impairment. The estimated fair values at October 1, 2020 exceeded their carrying values by 99% and 87% for the Radiology and
Oncology reporting units, respectively. In connection with its 2020 annual impairment test, the Company concluded that the carrying
value of the Interventional reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value based on management’s assessment of the outlook and longterm business plans for this division. Consequently, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $19.0 million related to goodwill in
the Interventional reporting unit. In connection with the AI sale (see Note 3), the remaining Interventional goodwill balance of $8.4
million was written off as of December 31, 2020.

In connection with its 2019 annual impairment test, the Company concluded that the carrying value of the Interventional
reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value based on management’s assessment of the outlook and long-term business plans for this
division. Consequently, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $3.9 million related to goodwill in the Interventional reporting
unit.

Changes in estimates or assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and the conclusions of the

Company’s impairment test. In addition to its annual review, the Company performs a test of impairment when indicators of
impairment are present. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no indications of impairment of the Company’s goodwill
balances.

As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company’s total accumulated goodwill impairment was $197.2 million and $178.2
million, respectively.

Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consist of Certificates of Need and regulatory authority rights, were tested for

impairment as of October 1, 2020 and October 1, 2019, the dates of the Company’s annual impairment review for the years ended
December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company elected to perform a qualitative assessment of factors to determine whether
further impairment testing was required. Based on its testing, the Company concluded there was no impairment of indefinite-lived
intangible assets as of October 1, 2020 and October 1, 2019.

In addition to its annual review, the Company performs an impairment test when indicators of impairment are present. During
December 2020, the Company re-evaluated its finite-lived intangible assets associated with the Interventional division due to the
projected outlook and long-term business plans for the division, as well as in connection with the divestiture of a portion of this division
through the AI Sale (see Note 3). Consequently, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $10.0 million for the remaining
carrying value of its intangible assets associated with the Interventional Division during the year ended December 31, 2020.

As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no indications of impairment of the Company’s intangible assets balances.

The CARES Act provided for qualified healthcare providers to receive advanced payments under the existing Medicare


Accelerated and Advance Payments Program (“MAAPP”) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Under this program, healthcare providers
could choose to receive advanced payments for future Medicare services provided. During 2020, the Company applied for and
received approval to receive MAAPP funds from Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The Company recorded these payments
as a liability until all performance obligations have been met, as the payments were made on behalf of patients before services were
provided. MAAPP funds received are required to be applied to future Medicare billings commencing in April 2021, with all such
remaining amounts required to be repaid by September 2022. Included in other accrued liabilities at December 31, 2020 is
$6.1 million of MAAPP funds.


In addition, the CARES Act provided waivers, reimbursement, grants and other funds to assist healthcare providers during the


COVID-19 pandemic, including $100 billion in appropriations for the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund, also
referred to as the Provider Relief Fund, to be used for preventing, preparing, and responding to the coronavirus, and for reimbursing
eligible healthcare providers for lost revenues and healthcare related expenses that are attributable to COVID-19. During 2020, the
Company received $6.6 million of payments (“Relief Funds”) under the CARES Act, of which $6.2 million were recorded in other
income, net in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2020, and $0.4

**_Credit Agreements_**

On October 24, 2017, the Company established two credit facilities. The Company entered into a first lien credit agreement
with JPMorgan Chase Bank, NA (“JPM”), as administrative agent, Bank of America, NA and Barclays Bank PLC, as syndication
agents, and other lenders party thereto (the “First Lien Credit Agreement”). The Company also entered into a second lien credit
agreement with Wilmington Trust, National Association, as administrative agent, JPM, as syndication agent, and other lenders party
thereto (the “Second Lien Credit Agreement”). Collectively, the two agreements are referred to as the “Credit Agreements” herein.
Under the Credit Agreements, the lenders provided the Company with: (i) a senior first lien credit facility in an aggregate principal
amount of $530.0 million, consisting of a $405.0 million, six-year term loan facility and a $125.0 million, five-year revolving loan
facility, including a $10.0 million sublimit for letters of credit; (ii) a $120.0 million, six-and one-half year second lien term loan
facility; and (iii) uncommitted incremental loan facilities of $100.0 million, which are shared between the First Lien Credit
Agreement and Second Lien Credit Agreement.


-----

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**

**December 31, 2020 and 2019**

Borrowings under the First Lien Credit Agreement bear interest through maturity at a variable rate based upon, at the
Company’s option, either the LIBOR or the base rate (which is the highest of (a) the administrative agent’s prime rate, (b) the rate
which is one-half of 1.00% in excess of the New York Federal Reserve Bank Rate (“NYFRB Rate”) (as defined in the First Lien
Credit Agreement), or (c) the rate which is 1.00% in excess of the one-month LIBOR rate), plus, in each case, an applicable margin.
With respect to the first lien term loan facility, the applicable margin for LIBOR loans is 4.50% per annum, with a LIBOR floor of
1.00%, and with respect to the first lien revolving loan facility, the applicable margin for LIBOR loans ranges from 3.00% to 4.25%
per annum, based on the applicable leverage ratio. The applicable margin for base rate loans under the first lien term loan facility is
3.50% per annum and under the first lien revolving loan facility ranges from 2.00% to 3.25% per annum, based on the applicable
leverage ratio. The Company is required to pay a commitment fee which ranges from 0.40% to 0.50% per annum, based on the
applicable leverage ratio, on the undrawn portion available under the first lien revolving loan facility and variable per annum fees
with respect to outstanding letters of credit.

Borrowings under the Second Lien Credit Agreement bear interest through maturity at a variable rate based upon, at the
Company’s option, either the LIBOR or the base rate (which is the highest of (a) the administrative agent’s prime rate, (b) the rate
which is one-half of 1.00% in excess of the Federal Funds Effective Rate (as defined in the Second Lien Credit Agreement), or (c)
the rate which is 1.00% in excess of the one-month LIBOR rate), plus, in each case, an applicable margin. With respect to the second
lien term loan facility, the applicable margin is 10.00% per annum for LIBOR loans, with a LIBOR floor of 1.00%, and 9.00% for
base rate loans.

Obligations under the Credit Agreements are guaranteed by substantially all the Company’s direct and indirect domestic and
foreign subsidiaries. The obligations under the Credit Agreements and the guarantees are secured by a lien on substantially all
tangible and intangible property and by a pledge of all of the shares of stock and limited liability company interests of the Company’s
direct and indirect subsidiaries, subject to limited exceptions. In the case of subsidiaries that are either (i) a direct Material Foreign
Subsidiary or (ii) a direct CFC Holdco (as defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement), up to but not exceeding 65% of the total
shares will be pledged as security.

In addition to other covenants, the Credit Agreements place limits on the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to declare
dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock, prepay, redeem or purchase debt, incur liens and engage in sale-leaseback
transactions, make loans and investments, incur additional indebtedness, amend or otherwise alter debt and other material
agreements, engage in mergers, acquisitions and asset sales, transact with affiliates and alter the business conducted by the Company
and its subsidiaries.

Prior to the amendment discussed below, the Credit Agreements contained financial covenants, including a maximum leverage
ratio and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, and other customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. Under
the First Lien Credit Agreement, the leverage ratio covenant required the Company to maintain a maximum Consolidated Leverage
Ratio (as defined in the agreement) that ranged from 5.00 to 1.00 to 4.50 to 1.00. Under the Second Lien Credit Agreement, the
Consolidated Leverage Ratio covenant ranged from 5.50 to 1.00 to 5.00 to 1.00. Under the First Lien Credit Agreement, the
minimum Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement) was 1.50. Failure to comply
with the covenants in the Credit Agreements could permit the lenders under the Credit Agreements to declare all amounts borrowed
under the Credit Agreements, together with accrued interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable and to terminate all
commitments under the Credit Agreements. The Company was in compliance with all such covenants as of December 31, 2019.

The outstanding principal balance of the term loans under the First Lien Credit Agreement is subject to repayment in quarterly
installments. No amortization payment is required with respect to the first lien revolving loan facility or the second lien term loan
facility. The Company is required to make mandatory prepayments of term loans under the Credit Agreements, subject to specified
exceptions, from Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the Credit Agreements) and with the proceeds of asset sales, debt issuances and
specified other events.

**_2020 Amendment to Credit Agreements_**

The Company has historically relied on cash flows from operations as well as borrowings under its credit facilities as the
primary sources of liquidity. The Credit Agreements contain certain financial covenants, including a Consolidated Leverage Ratio
and a Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio. Due to the unfavorable impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s business
operations, the Company was not in compliance with the Consolidated Leverage Ratio for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2020


-----

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**

**December 31, 2020 and 2019**

and June 30, 2020. On July 10, 2020 and August 10, 2020, the Company obtained waivers for the Specified Defaults and Related
Event of Default (as defined in the waivers) that occurred pursuant to the Credit Agreements. The waived covenants included, among
others, the Consolidated Leverage Ratio for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020 and the timely delivery of
audited financial statements and other information.

On October 13, 2020, the Company entered into amendments to the Credit Agreements that provided for, among other things,
an amendment to the Consolidated Leverage Ratio and the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio commencing for the fiscal
quarter ended September 30, 2020. In addition, a new monthly financial covenant was established to provide for a Minimum
Liquidity (as defined in the amendments). The required Minimum Liquidity is $40 million and $32 million for the First Lien Credit
Agreement and the Second Lien Credit Agreement, respectively. Commencing on November 30, 2021, the required Minimum
Liquidity is reduced to $32 million and $25 million for the First Lien Credit Agreement and the Second Lien Credit Agreement,
respectively.

Covenants under the amended First Lien Credit Agreement require the Company to maintain a maximum Consolidated
Leverage Ratio that ranges from 7.00 to 1.00 to 6.00 to 1.00, as well as a minimum Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio that
ranges from 1.25 to 1.00 to 1.50 to 1.00. Under the amended Second Lien Credit Agreement, the maximum Consolidated Leverage
Ratio covenant ranges from 7.50 to 1.00 to 6.50 to 1.00. The Company was in compliance with all such covenants as of December
31, 2020.

Principal payments due under the amended first lien term loan are subject to deferral of 40% of the principal payment, under
certain conditions, at the option of the Company for payments due through December 31, 2020; thereafter, principal payments are
dependent upon the Company’s Liquidity (as defined in the amendment). Borrowings under the amended first lien term loan bear
additional interest ranging from 1% to 4% per annum and may be payable-in-kind (subject to certain conditions), and added to the
outstanding principal balance at the option of the Company. During 2020, interest payable-in-kind of $0.8 million was added to the
principal balance of the first lien term loan. The amended first lien revolving loan facility bears interest at a rate of 0.25% per annum
higher than the terms in the original agreement and added a LIBOR floor of 1%.

Borrowings under the amended Second Lien Credit Agreement bear additional interest of 1% per annum. Interest aggregating
10% per annum for LIBOR loans and 9% for base rate loans is payable-in-kind (subject to certain conditions) and added to the
outstanding principal balance at the option of the Company. During 2020, interest payable-in-kind of $2.1 million was added to the
principal balance of the second lien term loan.

The amendments to the Credit Agreements provide for a Capital Event (as defined in the amendments), which requires the
Company to (i) repay at least $75 million of the outstanding first lien term loan principal balance (from sources specified in the
amendment) on or prior to November 15, 2021, or (ii) have achieved a Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 4.50 to 1.00 or less as of any
single fiscal quarter ending prior to November 1, 2021. In connection with the amendments, the Company paid a 1% consent fee to
the consenting lenders under the Credit Agreements.

In connection with the amendments to the Credit Agreements, the Company’s immediate parent company, THAIHOT
Investment Company US Limited (“THAIHOT”) issued warrants to purchase shares of THAIHOT common stock for the benefit of
the lenders of the first lien term loan facility and the second lien term loan facility. The warrants granted represent 25% of the shares
of THAIHOT’s common stock (“Initial Warrant Grant”) at a purchase price per share of $0.01. The warrants may be repurchased by
THAIHOT on or prior to a Capital Event (as defined in the amendments to the Credit Agreements) for $25 million. If the repurchase
occurs after a Capital Event, the price will be the then-current fair market value as determined by an independent third-party appraisal
firm. In the event the Company does not complete a Capital Event by November 15, 2021 (“Triggering Event”), THAIHOT will be
required to issue warrants to purchase additional shares of THAIHOT common stock at a price per share of $0.01. The aggregate
amount of warrants to be granted from the Initial Warrant Grant and the Triggering Event represents 95% of the shares of
THAIHOT’s common stock. All warrants expire seven years from the original issue date.

Based on a third-party valuation of the fair value of the warrants, the Company recorded $19.7 million in additional paid-in
capital as a contribution from THAIHOT during 2020. The fair value of the warrants was determined with a Monte Carlo Simulation
model utilizing the following estimates and key assumptions:


-----

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**

**December 31, 2020 and 2019**

Discount rate 10.5%

Common equity value $144 million

Expected daily return 0.02%

EBITDA multiple 7.1x

Volatility 2.6%

As a result of the amendment, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a $14.6 million loss on
extinguishment or modification of debt, based on an analysis of the underlying lender parties. The Company incurred fees totaling
$39.7 million (including $19.7 million fair value of the warrants), of which $27.1 million were capitalized and are being amortized
using the effective interest method as interest expense over the term of the Credit Agreements.

As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $39.5 million of available borrowings under its revolving loan facility, net of
$80.0 million outstanding on the revolving loan facility and $5.5 million outstanding in letters of credit.

**_Equipment Debt_**

Equipment debt is composed of financing arrangements between the Company and various lenders. Equipment debt obligations
are collateralized by equipment and have interest rates ranging from 1.55% to 8.75%. These debt obligations are generally payable in
various monthly principal and interest payments through 2031. Certain of the Company’s financing arrangements consisted of
interest-only equipment lines of credit. Upon completion of the related equipment projects, amounts advanced under these equipment
line of credit arrangements were converted into fixed term loans. All interest-only equipment lines of credit expired during 2020 and
the Company has no borrowings outstanding under these arrangements as of December 31, 2020.

Certain of the Company’s equipment debt obligations are subject to covenants with which it must comply on a quarterly or
annual basis. The Company was in compliance with all such covenants as of December 31, 2020.

**_Obligations Under Capital Leases_**

Obligations under capital leases are collateralized by equipment and have interest rates ranging from 3.72% to 6.54%. These
obligations are payable in various monthly principal and interest payments through 2024.

**_Principal Payments on Debt_**

The annual principal maturities of long-term debt and obligations under capital leases as of December 31, 2020 are as follows:

**8. Derivatives and Cash Flow Hedges**

The Company has multiple interest rate swap agreements to hedge the future cash interest payments on portions of its variablerate bank debt in order to avoid volatility in operating results due to fluctuations in interest rates.

The Company established five single-year interest rate swap agreements ("JPM Interest Rate Swaps") with JPM, the
administrative agent of the First Lien Credit Agreement. The JPM Interest Rate Swaps, which mature on June 30, 2019, June 30,
2020, June 30, 2021, June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, respectively, have notional amounts of $300.0 million each and were
designated as cash flow hedges of future cash interest payments associated with a portion of the Company’s variable rate debt
included in the Credit Agreements (see Note 7). Under the terms of these swap agreements, the Company receives one-month LIBOR
and pays fixed rates ranging from 2.483% to 3.167% on the notional amounts. The net effect of the hedges is to record interest
expense at these fixed rates plus the applicable margin of the underlying debt.

At December 31, 2020, the Company had interest rate swap agreements to hedge $307.9 million of its variable-rate bank debt
or approximately 54% of total variable-rate debt. At December 31, 2019, the Company had interest rate swap agreements to hedge
$309.3 million of its variable-rate bank debt or approximately 55% of total variable-rate debt. The amount that the Company expects
to reclassify from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense over the next twelve months is $6.2 million.

A summary of the Company’s derivative liabilities is as follows:

**9. Equity and Related Transactions**

**_Capital Contributions_**

During 2020, the Company recorded a capital contribution of $19.7 million related to the fair value of the warrants issued by

THAIHOT in connection with the 2020 Amendment to Credit Agreements (see Note 7).

During 2019, the Company received a capital contribution of $8.5 million from its parent company.

**_Stock Appreciation Rights_**

During 2018, the Company adopted a long-term incentive program (“2018 LTIP”) pursuant to which certain key management
personnel and non-employee consultants are eligible to receive Stock Appreciation Rights (“SARs”). SARs have 10-year terms and
vest in three equal installments on each of the three anniversaries following the vesting commencement date. SARs are granted with a
base price of not less than 100% of the fair value of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant. Once vested, SARs can be
exercised to acquire shares of the Company’s common stock during the specified annual exercise period. The number of shares to be
issued upon exercise of the SARs is based on the aggregate appreciation of the SARs value, calculated as the difference between the
fair market value of the Company’s common stock as of the specified valuation date preceding the exercise date and the SARs base
price. SARs are subject to accelerated vesting provisions upon certain change in control and other specified events. Upon termination
of employment or service, unvested awards are generally cancelled and vested awards may be exercised for a limited period of time.
Under the plan, up to 750,000 SARs may be granted and SARs that are exercised, forfeited or canceled or otherwise not paid will not
again be available for grant under the plan.

In connection with the 2018 LTIP program, 29,935 SARs were exercised during the year ended December 31, 2019 and, as a
result, the Company issued 1,869 shares of common stock in full satisfaction of the exercised SARs. No SARs were exercised during
the year ended December 31, 2020.

The Company engaged a third-party valuation firm to estimate the fair value of its common stock as of the specified valuation
date preceding the 2019 exercise date, which used a combination of the income and market approach. The valuation utilized the
following Level 3 estimates and assumptions in its analyses:

Discount rate 12.0%

Perpetual growth rate 2.0%

Tax rate 25.0%

Risk-free interest rate 3.5%

Peer company beta 0.8

Revenue multiple 1.4x

EBITDA multiple 6.8x

As of December 31, 2020, the Company had total unrecognized compensation cost of $0.1million related to non-vested
awards, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of 0.25 years.
Share-based compensation expense related to the SARs was $0.5 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and
December 31, 2029, and was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations
and comprehensive loss.

**_Other Equity Transactions_**

During 2019, the Company entered into an agreement with one of its joint venture partners to forego a mandatory redemption
provision allowing the noncontrolling interest holder to sell 10% of its noncontrolling interest to Alliance as part of the terms of the
original joint venture acquisition. The fair value of the mandatory redemption provision was estimated by a third-party appraisal at
$2.4 million and was recorded as a liability. Upon the mutual agreement to forego the redemption provision, the liability was
determined to be extinguished and the Company reclassified $2.4 million from other liabilities to additional paid-in capital during the
year ended December 31, 2019.

**10. Commitments and Contingencies**

**_Purchase Commitments_**

The Company has certain binding purchase commitments primarily for the purchase of equipment from various suppliers. As
of December 31, 2020, the obligations for these future purchase commitments totaled $37.8 million, of which $29.5 million is
expected to be paid in 2021 and $8.3 million is expected to be paid in 2022.

**_Leases_**

The Company leases office and warehouse space and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. The office and
warehouse leases generally call for minimum monthly payments plus maintenance and inflationary increases. The future minimum
payments under operating leases are as follows:


**(in thousands)**


Year ending December 31:


2021 $ 16,198

2022 15,771

2023 15,395

2024 13,982

2025 9,683

Thereafter 42,727

$ 113,756

Rent expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease term and those renewal periods that are reasonably
assured as determined at lease inception. The Company’s total rental expense, which includes short-term equipment rentals, for the
years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $20.0 million and $22.2 million, respectively.

**_Guarantees and Indemnities_**

The Company has applied the disclosure provisions of ASC 460, “Guarantees,” to its agreements that contain guarantee or
indemnification clauses. These disclosure provisions expand those required by ASC 440, “Commitments,” and ASC 450,
“Contingencies,” by requiring a guarantor to disclose certain types of guarantees, even if the likelihood of requiring the guarantor’s
performance is remote. The following is a description of arrangements in which the Company is the guarantor or indemnifies a party.

In the normal course of business, the Company has made certain guarantees and indemnities, under which it may be required to
make payments to a guaranteed or indemnified party, in relation to certain transactions. The Company indemnifies other parties,
including customers, lessors, and parties to other transactions with the Company, with respect to certain matters. The Company has
agreed to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract, which may
include, for example, litigation or claims arising from a breach of representations or covenants. In addition, the Company has entered
into indemnification agreements with its executive officers and directors and the Company’s bylaws contain similar indemnification
obligations. Under these arrangements, the Company is obligated to indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law,
its current or former officers and directors for various amounts incurred with respect to actions, suits or proceedings in which they
were made, or threatened to be made, a party as a result of acting as an officer or director.

It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited
history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically,
payments made related to these indemnifications have been immaterial. At December 31, 2020, the Company has determined that no
liability is necessary related to these guarantees and indemnities.

**_Other Matters_**

The Company from time to time is involved in routine litigation and regulatory matters incidental to the conduct of its
business. The Company believes that resolution of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial
statements.

**December 31, 2020 and 2019**

As of December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $27.9 million (an increase of $16.5 million in 2020)
against its deferred tax assets, principally related to its net operating losses. Based on the Company's earnings history and available
objectively verifiable positive and negative evidence, the Company determined that it is more likely than not that a portion of its
deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future.

As of December 31, 2020, the Company has provided a liability of $0.1 million for unrecognized tax benefits related to various
federal and state income tax matters. The tax-effected amount that would reduce the Company's effective income tax rate if
recognized is $0.1 million.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

**(in thousands)** **2020** **2019**

Unrecognized tax benefits at January 1 $ 112   $ 140

Increases for positions taken in current year 23 25

The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax benefit in the
consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as
of December 31, 2020 were not material.

The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state tax jurisdictions. The Company's
federal tax returns are currently open to audit under the statute of limitations by the Internal Revenue Service for the years ended
December 31, 2017 through 2020. The Company's state income tax returns are open to audit under the applicable statutes of
limitations for the years ended December 31, 2016 through 2020. The Company does not anticipate a significant change to the total
amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months.

**14. Investment in Unconsolidated Investee**

The Company has direct ownership in one unconsolidated investee at December 31, 2020 and 2019. The Company owns 15%
of this investee and provides management services under a management agreement with the investee. Revenues from the
management agreement were $1.5 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.

The Company provides services as part of its ongoing operations for and on behalf of the unconsolidated investee, which
reimburses the Company for the actual amount of the expenses incurred. The Company records the expenses in cost of revenues and
the reimbursement as revenue in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Reimbursed expenses related to
the Company’s unconsolidated equity investee were $1.0 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
