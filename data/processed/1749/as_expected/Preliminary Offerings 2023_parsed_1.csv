The foregoing authorities have not confirmed the accuracy or determined the adequacy of this document. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense. There are no registration rights associated with the Notes or the related guarantees.,26.1.1,,"We are making this offering in reliance on an exemption from registration under the Securities Act for offers and sales of securities that do not involve a public offering. The Notes may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws. Laws in certain jurisdictions may restrict the distribution of this offering circular and the offer and sale of the Notes. Persons into whose possession this offering circular or any of the Notes are delivered must inform themselves about, and observe, those restrictions. You must comply with all applicable laws and regulations in force in any applicable jurisdiction, and you must obtain any consent, approval or permission required for the purchase, offer or sale by you of the Notes under the laws and regulations in force in the jurisdiction to which you are subject or in which you make such purchase, offer or sale, and neither we nor the initial purchasers will have any responsibility therefor. The Notes are subject to restrictions on transferability and resale and may not be transferred or resold except as permitted under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws pursuant to registration or exemption therefrom. As a prospective purchaser, you should be aware that you may be required to bear the financial risks of this investment for an indefinite period of time. See “Plan of Distribution” and “Transfer Restrictions.” By purchasing the Notes, you will be deemed to have made acknowledgments, representations, warranties and agreements as set forth under “Transfer Restrictions” in this offering circular. We are not, and the initial purchasers are not, making an offer to sell the Notes in any jurisdiction except where an offer or sale is permitted. The offering is being made on the basis of this offering circular and is subject to the terms described in this offering circular and the indenture relating to the Notes. In making an investment decision, prospective investors must rely on their own examination of the Issuer and the terms of the offering, including the merits and risks involved. Prospective investors should not construe anything in this offering circular as legal, business or tax advice. Each prospective investor should consult its own advisors as needed to make its investment decision and to determine whether it is legally permitted to purchase the securities under applicable legal investment or similar laws or regulations. ----- We do not intend to apply for listing of the Notes on any securities exchange or for inclusion of the Notes in any automated dealer quotation system. The Notes will initially be available in book-entry form only. We expect that the Notes will be issued in the form of one or more registered global notes. The global notes will be deposited with the registrar, as custodian for DTC as depositary, and registered in the name of Cede & Co. or another nominee of such depositary. Beneficial interests in the global notes will be shown on, and transfers of beneficial interests in the global notes will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC and its participants. After the initial issuance of the global notes, certificated notes will be issued in exchange for global notes only in the limited circumstances set forth in the indenture that will govern the Notes. See “Book Entry, Delivery and Form.” The Issuer reserves the right to withdraw this offering of Notes at any time and the Issuer and the initial purchasers reserve the right to reject any commitment to subscribe for the Notes, in whole or in part. The Issuer and the initial purchasers also reserve the right to allot to you less than the full amount of Notes sought by you. The initial purchasers and certain related entities may acquire for their own account a portion of the Notes. In connection with this offering, the initial purchasers may purchase and sell Notes in the open market. These transactions may include over allotment, covering transactions and stabilizing transactions. Any of these transactions may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the marker prices of the Notes. They may also cause the price of the Notes to be higher than the price that otherwise would exist in the open market in the absence of these transactions. The initial purchasers may conduct these transactions in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. If the initial purchasers commence any of these transactions, they may discontinue them at any time. See “Plan of Distribution.” We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about , 2023, which will be the     business day following the date of pricing of the Notes (such settlement cycle being herein referred to as “T+     “). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes prior to the date that is two business days preceding the settlement date will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will settle T+    , to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of Notes who wish to trade the Notes during such period should consult their own advisor.

1749_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,2674,USE OF UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION,2674.1,,2674.1.1,,"This offering circular contains unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information for the Issuer, in order to give effect to the Transactions, which has been derived from the historical financial statements of Syneos Health included in this offering circular. The assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments are described in the notes accompanying the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information included elsewhere in this offering circular and should be read together with the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information has been prepared on a basis that is generally consistent with Article 11 of Regulation S-X but does not comply with all requirements of the SEC that would apply in a public filing with the SEC. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information gives effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on (i) June 30, 2023, for purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance ----- sheet, and (ii) January 1, 2022 for the purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022, the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 and the twelve months ended June 30, 2023. The historical financial statements of Syneos Health have been adjusted in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information included elsewhere in this offering circular to give effect to pro forma events that are transaction accounting adjustments, which is necessary to account for the Transactions and the issuance of the Notes offerred hereby in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The unaudited pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions that Syneos Health’s management believes are reasonable. We have not made any adjustments in the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information to reflect any expected cost savings arising from the Transactions. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information has been prepared using the acquisition method of accounting under the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standard Codification Topic 805, Business Combinations. The purchase price will be allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date with the exception of contract assets and liabilities, which are recognized in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts _with Customers; any excess value of the consideration transferred over the net assets will be recognized as goodwill._ Syneos Health has made a preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date based on management’s preliminary estimates of the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed using information currently available, such as comparable industry transactions. Differences between these preliminary estimates and the final acquisition accounting will occur and these differences could have a material impact on the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information and Syneos Health’s future results of operations and financial position. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information has been prepared by our management team for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the consolidated financial position or results of operations that would have been realized had the Transactions and the issuance of the Notes occurred on the dates indicated, nor is it meant to be indicative of any future consolidated financial position or future results of operations that Syneos Health will experience. The pro forma adjustments are based on the preliminary assumptions and information available that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The actual results of Syneos Health may differ significantly from those reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information has no impact on Syneos Health’s previously reported consolidated balance sheets or statements of operations, cash flows or equity. See “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated and Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information.” In this offering circular, references to financial or other data presented as “pro forma” or “on a pro forma basis” refer to a presentation that applies adjustments to give pro forma effect to the Transactions.",N/A,as_expected,2023,344

We anticipate that each of the non-GAAP measures noted in this offering circular will be used by management and the Board to evaluate the Company’s core operating results because they exclude certain items whose fluctuations from period-to-period do not necessarily correspond to changes in the core operations of the business. ----- Such non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared with a view towards compliance with published guidelines of the SEC, and are not measures of net income, operating income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, and are subject to important limitations. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude or include amounts from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statements of operations, balance sheets, or statements of cash flows of the Company, and they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. Also, other companies might calculate these measures differently. For a reconciliation of such non-GAAP financial measures to the most closely comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, see “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated and Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information.” The financial information included in this offering circular is not intended to comply with the requirements of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder, in particular with respect to (a) the omission of certain consolidating financial information regarding the guarantor and non-guarantor subsidiaries, (b) the presentation of the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information in the section entitled “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information” and (c) the exclusion of historical financial information of the Issuer, which has no historical operations. We have included Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA in this offering circular for illustrative purposes, to present certain normalizing adjustments and estimated run-rate cost savings, inclusive of savings from commercial expense, operations expense, technology, general and administrative and third-party spend that are planned, but have not been actioned to date. Further, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with a view toward complying with the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, but, in the view of the management of Syneos Health, have been prepared on a reasonable basis, reflect the best currently available estimates and judgments, and present, to the best of Syneos Health’s knowledge and belief, the expected course of action and what Syneos Health believes its financial performance would have been had these actions been fully accounted for or implemented at the start of the applicable period. However, this information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results, and readers of this offering circular are cautioned not to place undue reliance on Adjusted EBITDA or Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA. None of Syneos Health, the Issuer or Syneos Health’s independent auditors, or any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined, or performed any procedures with respect to the estimated cost savings included in the Adjusted EBITDA or Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA information contained herein, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its achievability. The assumptions and estimates underlying the Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA figures are inherently uncertain and, though considered reasonable by the management of Syneos Health and the Issuer as of the date of preparation, are subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic, and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual cost savings to differ materially from the estimated cost savings included in Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, including, among others, risks and uncertainties including those discussed under “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in this offering circular. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that Adjusted EBITDA or Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is indicative of the future performance of the Issuer or that actual results will not differ materially from the estimates included in Adjusted EBITDA or Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA.",N/A,as_expected,2023,344

1749_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Our Solutions,9.4.1,,"## 2[nd] _Largest Contract Commercial Organization (CCO) by Net Revenue_ We provide services through two reportable segments: Clinical Solutions (CRO) and Commercial Solutions (CCO). Our Clinical Solutions segment offers comprehensive global services for the development of diagnostics, drugs, biologics, devices, and digital therapeutics that span Phases I to IV of clinical development. This segment also offers customized individual services including regulatory consulting, project management, protocol development, 1 ----- investigational site recruitment, clinical monitoring, technology-enabled patient recruitment and engagement, clinical home health services, clinical trial diversity and biometrics, all across a wide range of therapeutic areas (“TAs”). Our Commercial Solutions segment offers solutions including field team deployment and communications and full-service integrated offerings to the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and healthcare industries. Together, our services cover the entire spectrum of clinical development and marketing and related support, from early-stage clinical development through FDA approval and ultimately commercialization. We believe this collaboration across the development and commercialization continuum facilitates unique insights impacting patient populations, therapeutic environments, product launch timelines, and the competitive landscape. Clinical Solutions_** _(76% of 2022 Revenue) Our extensive range of clinical solutions supports the entire clinical development process from Phase I to Phase IV. We have strengths in complex TAs such as central nervous system (“CNS”), cell and gene therapy, infectious disease and vaccines, immunology, inflammation and oncology, with the latter representing the largest and fastest growing TA. Our solutions can be delivered on a full-service project basis, on a functional service basis, or through a hybrid approach depending on the needs of our customers. Our Clinical Solutions segment had average annual net revenue growth of 8% from 2019 to 2022. Our suite of clinical development services includes the following, among others: Full Service (“FSO”). Our Full-Service clinical development offering (73% of Clinical Solutions 2022 Net Revenue) provides comprehensive solutions to address the clinical development needs of our customers, focused on Phase IIB to Phase III clinical trials. FSO clinical study services are highly technical in nature, with multi-year average contract lengths and high switching costs for customers mid-study. Our full suite of clinical development services includes the following, among others: patient recruitment and retention, site start-up services, project management, clinical monitoring, decentralized solutions (e.g., remote engagement and mobile research nursing clinical trial services), drug safety and pharmacovigilance, quality assurance, regulatory and medical writing, clinical data management, electronic data capture, and biostatistics. 2 ----- Functional Service (“FSP”). Our Functional Service Provider offering (19% of Clinical Solutions 2022 Net Revenue) allows pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical sponsors to outsource specific functional areas of clinical research and/or selectively augment their internal resources. As part of the FSP delivery method, we provide highly skilled and technical personnel to build “centers of excellence” within the customer’s organization that provide functional support for executing clinical trials. Through the FSP model, we can provide customized support to customers within an individual clinical study, a single function, multiple functions within a single TA, or across a customer’s entire product portfolio. This business is highly recurring in nature, because our personnel are deeply embedded in customers’ clinical trial organizations. This integration typically results in the customers staying with the same FSP service provider for multiple years, with underlying FSP master services agreements (“MSAs”) typically lasting approximately three years. Historically, our growing FSP business has also helped us win incremental FSO business over time, particularly with the large pharmaceutical customers that represent a significant portion of the FSP market. Early Phase & Other Solutions. Our Early Phase & Other Solutions offerings (8% of Clinical Solutions 2022 Net Revenue) consist of our Early Phase offering, our Real World Evidence (“RWE”) & Late Phase offering, and our Clinical Technology & Data businesses. Our Early Phase offering provides a full range of services for early phase to Phase IIA clinical trials, including bioanalytical assay development and analysis, targeted translational science offerings, and clinical pharmacology services, including modeling and simulation. We also provide validation and sample analysis services from preclinical development through post-marketing support and purpose-built early phase biometrics support. We have robust expertise with an array of investigational products, including those of biological origin and with multiple delivery methods. We collaborate with leading hospitals for the conduct of early development and clinical pharmacology studies that require access to patients. We have a large base of available subjects, including patient populations with specific medical conditions and healthy volunteers, which provides efficient and rapid patient recruitment. Our Early Phase services require sites and staff that are specifically set up and trained for early stage trials. Our Other Solutions include our Real World Evidence (“RWE”) and Late Phase businesses that provide outsourced, long-term longitudinal studies focused on tracking the health impact of medicines in patient populations. Our Technology & Data business, which launched and ramped up in 2021, includes predictive analytics and AI-based applications that facilitate pharmaceutical customers’ trial processes (e.g. country and site selection, patient recruitment and enrollment, and site activation). The TAs that we cover include CNS, oncology, general medicine, cardiovascular and metabolic, and respiratory, among others. CNS and oncology made up approximately 50% of Clinical Solutions net revenue in 2022. Within CNS, our specialties include analgesia, neurology, psychiatry, clinical surveillance, and training. Within oncology, our offerings extend from preclinical and translational science to clinical development, regulatory, and commercialization/marketing capabilities. We have extensive experience across a range of cancer therapies ranging from targeted, to immuno-oncology, to novel and emerging treatments. Commercial Solutions_** _(24% of 2022 Revenue) Our Commercial Solutions segment provides a broad suite of complementary commercialization services including field team deployment solutions, communications services (advertising, public relations, and medical communications), and consulting services. Additionally, these capabilities provide behavioral and patient insights that allow us to design smarter clinical trials and accelerate patient recruitment in our Clinical Solutions segment. Our Commercial Solutions segment had average annual net revenue growth of 4% from 2019 to 2022. 3 ----- These services are enhanced by Kinetic, our modern customer engagement capability. We use an intelligent and dataenabled approach to digitally enhance our commercialization services by understanding the audiences for our customers’ products, synchronizing their experiences across multiple personal and digital channels, and decoding the performance of these interactions to adapt in real-time.

Given the critical nature of the services that we provide and the long-term nature of clinical development trials our FSO customers typically face high switching costs once they’ve entered into a contract. Through our FSP model we provide customized support to customers where our personnel are deeply embedded in customer’s clinical trial organizations, with master service agreements that typically have approximately three years duration. The long-term nature of our service offerings results in an existing backlog that provides a high degree of revenue visibility for the CRO business. Deep Expertise and Differentiated Value Proposition Across Therapeutic Areas and Delivery Models._** We are differentiated by our significant experience, deep therapeutic knowledge, and ability to manage complex trials, including in oncology and CNS, which are two of the largest and fastest growing therapeutic areas. Oncology is Syneos’ largest therapeutic area at 33% of clinical net revenue and is the highest growth therapeutic area for CRO spend, while CNS is one the fastest growing therapeutic areas due to increased investment from pharmaceutical R&D spend and biotech funding in the space. Oncology FSO net revenue has grown at a CAGR of approximately 24% from 2019 to 2022, while the overall market grew 10% during this same time period, with recent RFPs and awards suggesting that CNS is well-positioned to grow. Our net promotor scores (“NPS”) for both Oncology and CNS are ahead of or in-line with leading players. We also have a leading position in FSP and were an early entrant in the market. Our portfolio of services is integrated with many customers’ drug development processes. This allows us to be well positioned to provide customized FSP solutions to meet customers’ demands. Moreover, FSP delivery as a portion of the outsourcing market is growing, driven primarily by large pharmaceutical customers who want to maintain oversight and influence over their drug development pipeline while outsourcing key mission-critical services to CROs. From 2018 to 2021, FSP penetration of total outsourced clinical trial activities increased from 28% to 41%, representing approximately 13% growth per year.

We have made significant progress,"in undertaking a number of high-impact initiatives that have already resulted in improved business performance and are expected to lead to continued growth. Following an approximate 40% growth in bookings from 2019 to 2022 as a result of our leadership in growing segments of the market, our Clinical Solutions business experienced a decline in performance in the second half of 2022 driven by industry-high turnover and a lack of sufficient investment in our administrative systems after years of rapid growth. We have since made significant progress to address the performance challenges the company experienced in 2022. Across the industry, employee attrition increased through 2020 and 2021 due to a combination of the “Great Resignation” (the ongoing economic trend where employees voluntarily resigned from their jobs in mass in early 2021, sparked by the COVID pandemic) and cross-competitor recruiting of talent. Syneos experienced above-market attrition, driven by high utilization, underinvested administrative systems and operational volatility, with an approximate 95% increase in trailing 6-month voluntary attrition from June 2020 to September 2021. Over the last 18 months we have worked to improve employee engagement and reduce turnover by increasing wages to be in-line with or above market, centralizing resource management, and focusing on employee satisfaction. As a result, employee attrition has consistently trended down and has normalized to pre-2020 levels. To improve our underinvested administrative systems we initiated targeted upgrades of critical operational and backoffice systems, which are already improving workflow, and also took steps to improve customer-facing technology. This has resulted in recent quarterly results showing indications of significant progress, two indicators of which are First Site Activation (“FSA”) to target and Last Patient In (“LPI”) to target. FSA are new projects where we had the first trial active prior to the target start date, and LPI are projects where we met the target date for completion of the last patient in the trial. Both metrics represent our ability to deliver on customers’ required timelines and are an important purchasing factor for pharmaceutical companies when choosing a CRO. In the quarter ended June 30, 2023, our FSA and LPI to target metrics hit their highest levels since 2021, with FSA to target improving by approximately 45% from its trough in the first half of 2022 and LPI to target improving by approximately 50% since the second half of 2021 which, amongst other key performance indicators, is an indication of the improvements made in our delivery model. 7 IQVIA ----- We have also streamlined operations by reducing business unit siloing, encouraging cross-team collaboration, and dedicating significant resources to address customer delivery challenges. These actions have also resulted in a projectcentric delivery model focused on operational discipline, appropriate staffing, and trial performance, and have resulted in improved performance scorecards and new awards. As a result of our recent operational initiatives, we have seen a consistent improvement in RFP flow and book-to-bill after a trough in the quarter ended September 30, 2022. Clinical Solutions RFP flow was up approximately 26% in the quarter ended June 30, 2023 compared to the trough in the quarter ended September 30, 2022. This increase was driven by strong performance across both Top 50 and SMID customers. Clinical Solutions book-to-bill has also increased significantly compared to the trough in the quarter ended September 30, 2022, growing for three consecutive quarters and reaching 0.9x in the quarter ended June 30, 2023.

Some of the terms and conditions described below are subject to important limitations and exceptions. You should carefully read the “Description of the Notes” for a more detailed description of the offering and the Notes._ Issuer............................................................

Interest will accrue from the issue date of the Notes. Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption .................................................. This offering may be consummated prior to the consummation of the Merger. Unless the Merger will be consummated on the closing date of this offering, the Issuer will, on the closing date of this offering, deposit, or cause to be deposited, the applicable Escrowed Property into the Escrow Account for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes, pending the consummation of the Merger, and the Notes will be secured by a first-priority security interest in the Escrow Account and all deposits and investment property therein. The release of the Escrowed Property from the Escrow Account will be subject to satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions. If the Merger is not consummated on or prior to the Escrow Outside Date and we notify the Trustee and the Escrow Agent in writing that the Merger Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption at the Special Mandatory Redemption Price. Additional cash in respect of interest that would accrue on the Notes from and after the issue date of the Notes will not be pre-funded into the Escrow Account on the issue date of the Notes, but the Sponsors (directly or through one or more of their affiliates) will commit on or prior to the date of the consummation of this offering, in the event of a special mandatory redemption, to fund the Shortfall Redemption Amount. See “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.” Guarantees ................................................... Prior to the consummation of the Merger and the release of the Escrowed Property (if applicable), the Notes will be guaranteed on a senior secured basis only by Holdings and will not be the beneficiary of any credit support from Syneos Health and its subsidiaries. From and after the consummation of the Merger and following the release of the Escrowed Property (if applicable), the Notes will be, jointly and severally, unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by Holdings and each existing and future wholly-owned subsidiary of the Issuer that will guarantee the Issuer’s obligations under the New Credit 16 ----- Facilities. See “Description of the Notes—Guarantees.” See “Description of the Notes—Limitation on Guarantees.” Claims of holders of the Notes will be structurally subordinated to claims of creditors of certain of our subsidiaries that will not guarantee the Notes, including our foreign subsidiaries. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes.” As of and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, our nonguarantor subsidiaries generated approximately 32.9% of our consolidated revenues, generated approximately 33.8% of our EBITDA, held approximately 19.9% of our consolidated assets and had no long-term debt outstanding, in each case after intercompany eliminations. Ranking ........................................................ Prior to the consummation of the Merger and the release of the Escrowed Property (if applicable), the Notes will be the Issuer’s senior secured obligations secured by a first priority security interest in the applicable escrow account and all deposits and investment property therein. From and after the consummation of the Merger and following the release of the Escrowed Property (if applicable), the Notes and the related guarantees will be the Issuer’s and the guarantors’ senior secured obligations and will be: - secured on a first-priority basis by the Collateral on a pari _passu basis with the New Credit Facilities and all future_ indebtedness of the Issuer and the guarantors secured by a first-priority lien on the Collateral; - _pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future senior indebtedness of the Issuer and the guarantors; - effectively senior to the Issuer’s and the guarantors’ indebtedness that is unsecured or that is secured by junior liens on the Collateral, in each case, to the extent of the value of the Collateral; - senior in right of payment to any of the Issuer’s and the guarantors’ future subordinated indebtedness; - effectively subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness of the Issuer or any guarantor that is secured by assets that are not Collateral; and - structurally subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of any subsidiary that does not guarantee the Notes, including our foreign subsidiaries. As of June 30, 2023, on a pro forma basis as described under “Capitalization,” (i) we would have had approximately $3,700 million of total debt outstanding, all of which would have been secured by first priority liens on the Collateral, and (ii) we would have had approximately $485.8 million available for borrowing under the New Revolving Facility (after taking account of undrawn letters of credit), subject to customary conditions. The aggregate amount of undrawn letters of credit is 17 ----- expected to increase after the Effective Time. See “Risk Factors – Risks related to Our Business – Downgrades of our credit ratings could adversely affect us.” Any borrowings under the New Revolving Facility, once made, would constitute senior secured indebtedness. As of June 30, 2023, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, after intercompany eliminations, our nonguarantor subsidiaries would have had no long-term debt outstanding. Collateral ..................................................... From and after the consummation of the Merger and following the release of the Escrowed Property (if applicable), the Notes and related guarantees will be secured by first-priority liens on the Collateral, which consists of substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and guarantors, all of which will also secure the Issuer’s and the guarantors’ obligations under the New Credit Facilities, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens as described herein. The Collateral will exclude certain Excluded Property (as defined under “Description of the Notes”). See “Description of the Notes—Security for the Notes.” Intercreditor Agreement............................... Citibank, N.A., a national banking association organized and existing under the laws of the United States, acting through its Agency & Trust business not in its individual capacity but solely as collateral agent for the Notes (such collateral agent, the “Notes Collateral Agent” will become a party to an intercreditor agreement (the “Intercreditor Agreement”) with the collateral agent under the New Credit Facilities (the “New Credit Agreement Collateral Agent”), setting forth therein the relative rights with respect to the Shared Collateral (as defined under “Description of the Notes”) and covering certain other matters relating to the administration of security interests. Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the New Credit Agreement Collateral Agent will initially control substantially all matters related to the Shared Collateral, including with respect to decisions or enforcement, and may take actions that the holders of the Notes may disagree with or that may be contrary to the interests of the holders of the Notes. The Intercreditor Agreement will also include waivers of certain important rights that holders of secured debt would otherwise have. Optional Redemption ................................... The Issuer may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time on or after     , 2026 at the redemption prices set forth in this offering circular, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

(b) Restructuring and other costs consist primarily of termination costs associated with abandonment and closure of redundant facilities and other lease-related charges and severance costs associated with reduction/optimization of our workforce as part of our business transformation initiatives. (c) Represents fees associated with acquisitions, debt placement and refinancings, and other corporate costs that management believes are not representative of our operating performance, including one-time costs associated with our business transformation initiatives, the pending Merger, implementation costs associated with a new enterprise resource planning system, and incremental costs resulting from the war in Ukraine. (d) Represents non-cash share-based compensation expense related to awards granted under equity incentive plans. (e) Other expense (income), net is comprised primarily of foreign currency exchange gains and losses, other gains and losses related to investments, and contingent consideration related to divested businesses. (f) Loss on extinguishment of debt is associated with debt prepayments and refinancing activities. (g) Represents the income tax effect of the non-GAAP adjustments made to arrive at adjusted net income using an estimated effective tax rate of approximately 23.5% for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022.

These rates have been adjusted to exclude tax impacts related to valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets. (2) Clinical Solutions net new business awards represent new business awards of the Clinical Solutions segment, net of cancellations and are presented on a trailing twelve month basis. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations— New Business Awards and Backlog—Net New Business Awards.” 24 ----- (3) Clinical Solutions backlog is presented as of the last day of the period shown and represents anticipated revenue for work not yet completed or performed under executed contracts and other forms of written confirmation, where there is sufficient or reasonable certainty about the customer’s availability and intent to fund. Our backlog also reflects any cancellation or adjustment activity related to these awards. The Company’s backlog policy is conservative relative to the industry, as the Clinical Solutions awards and backlog policy requires that work must be expected to begin within six months of the end of the quarter in which the award was recognized in order to be added to the backlog. FSP awards are only booked on a twelve-month basis. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations— New Business Awards and Backlog—Net New Business Awards.” (4) Clinical Solutions book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of Clinical Solutions net new business awards for the relevant period divided by Clinical Solutions revenue for the same period. (5) This is a non-GAAP financial measure. Reported EBITDA represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The Company defines Management Adjusted EBITDA as Reported EBITDA, further adjusted to exclude expenses and transactions that the Company believes are not representative of its core operations, namely: restructuring and other costs; transaction, integration-related, and other expenses; share-based compensation expense; and other income (expense), net. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as Management Adjusted EBITDA, further adjusted to add expenses or exclude gains that the Company believes are not representative of its normal operations, namely: adding certain bonus costs, excluding certain gains on sales of fleet vehicles, and accounting for other normalizing adjustments. The Company defines Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA, further adjusted to (a) include the full-year run rate benefit of cost savings actions implemented during the trailing twelve month period and (b) exclude costs that the Company believes can be avoided or reduced following the Merger, namely: certain public company to private cost savings, operational cost savings, and real estate cost savings. The Company defines Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenue, expressed as a percentage. The Company presents Reported EBITDA and Management Adjusted EBITDA because it believes they are useful metrics for investors as they are commonly used by investors, analysts and debt holders to measure the Company’s ability to fund capital expenditures and meet working capital requirements. Adjusted net income and Management Adjusted EBITDA are used by management and the Board to assess the performance of the Company’s business. The Company presents Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA to present, to the best of its knowledge and belief, the expected course of action and what Syneos Health believes its financial performance would have been had certain normalizing adjustments and estimated run-rate cost savings been fully accounted for and implemented at the start of the applicable period. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings and expect to incur substantial expenses related to the Merger, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.” The below table reconciles net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to Reported EBITDA, Management Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin.

Our inability to generate new business awards on a timely basis and subsequently enter into contracts for such awards could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. For example, in our Clinical Solutions segment, we have experienced lower flow of requests for proposals. In the SMID market specifically, we have also experienced delays in award decisions. For larger pharmaceutical companies specifically, we have started experiencing slower pipelines. These headwinds have been caused by the current macroeconomic conditions and our ability to win repeat business, among other factors. There is risk of cancelability in both the clinical and commercial businesses. The time between when a clinical study is awarded and when it goes to contract is typically several months and, prior to a new business award going to contract, our customer can cancel the award without notice. Once an award goes to contract, the majority of our customers can terminate the contract without cause with a notice period that generally ranges from 30 to 90 days. Our contracts have been and may in the future be delayed or terminated by our customers or reduced in scope for a variety of reasons, including factors beyond our control, including but not limited to: - decisions to forego or terminate a particular trial; - budgetary limits or changing priorities; - macroeconomic conditions, including but not limited to interest rate increases and inflation; - actions by regulatory authorities; - production problems resulting in shortages of the candidate drug being tested; - failure of products being tested to satisfy safety requirements or efficacy criteria; - unexpected or undesired clinical results for products; - insufficient patient enrollment in a trial; - insufficient principal investigator recruitment; - production problems resulting in shortages of the product being tested; - the customers’ decision to terminate or scale back the development or commercialization of a product or to end a particular project; ----- - challenges with customer engagement or satisfaction; - shift of business to a competitor or internal resources; or - product withdrawal following market launch. Our commercial services contracts typically have a significantly shorter wind down period than clinical contracts, particularly within our Deployment Solutions offerings. Furthermore, many of our communications services and consulting services projects are tied to a customer’s annual marketing budget or ad hoc service requests, which can lead to seasonal variability in revenue and less predictability in future revenues. In addition, many of our biopharmaceutical Deployment Solutions service contracts provide our customers with the opportunity to internalize the resources provided under the contract and terminate all or a portion of the services we provide under the contract. Our customers may also decide to shift their business to a competitor. Each of these factors results in less visibility to future revenue and may also result in high volatility in future revenue. Contract terminations, delays and modifications are a regular part of our business across each of our segments. Our full-service offering within our Clinical Solutions business has been, and may continue to be, negatively impacted by project delays, which impact near term revenue disproportionately. In addition, project delays, downsizings and cancellations, particularly within our Deployment Solutions and communications offerings, which are part of our Commercial Solutions business, have impacted our results in the past and might impact them in the future. The loss, reduction in scope or delay of a large project or of multiple projects could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, we might not realize the full benefits of our backlog if our customers cancel, delay, or reduce their commitments to us. In the event of termination, our contracts often provide for fees for winding down the project, which include both fees incurred and actual and non-cancellable expenditures and may include a fee to cover a percentage of the remaining professional fees on the project. These fees might not be sufficient for us to maintain our margins, and termination may result in lower resource utilization rates and therefore lower operating margins. In addition, cancellation of a contract or project for the reasons noted above may result in the unwillingness or inability of our customer to satisfy its existing obligations to us such as payments of accounts receivable, which may in turn result in a material impact to our results of operations and cash flow. Historically, cancellations and delays have negatively impacted our operating results, and they might again. In addition, we might not realize the full benefits of our backlog if our customers cancel, delay, or reduce their commitments to us, which may occur if, among other things, a customer decides to shift its business to a competitor or revoke our status as a preferred provider. Thus, the loss or delay of a large business award or the loss or delay of multiple awards could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. Additionally, a change in the timing of a new business award could affect the period over which we recognize revenue and reduce our revenue in any one quarter.",N/A,as_expected,2023,344

Once work begins on a project, revenue is recognized over the duration of the project, provided the award has gone to contract. Projects may be canceled or delayed by the customer or delayed by regulatory authorities. To the extent projects are delayed, the timing of our revenue could be adversely affected. In addition, if a customer terminates a contract, we typically would be entitled to receive payment for all services performed up to the termination date and subsequent customer-authorized services related to terminating the canceled project. Typically, however, we have no contractual right to the full amount of the future revenue reflected in our backlog in the event of a contract termination or subsequent changes in scope that reduce the value of the contract. The duration of the projects included in our backlog, and the related revenue recognition, typically range from a few months to several years. Our backlog might not be indicative of our future revenues, and we might not realize all the anticipated future revenue reflected in that backlog. A number of factors may affect backlog, including: - the size, complexity, and duration of projects or strategic relationships; ----- - the cancellation or delay of projects; - the failure of one or more business awards to go to contract; and - changes in the scope of work during the course of projects. The rate at which our backlog converts to revenue may vary over time. The revenue recognition on larger, more global projects could be slower than on smaller, more regional projects for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, an extended period of negotiation between the time the project is awarded to us and the actual execution of the contract, as well as an increased time frame for obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals. In addition, we provide certain services to our customers before they pay us. There is a risk that we may initiate a clinical trial or commercial offering for a customer, and the customer subsequently becomes unwilling or unable to fund the completion of the services. In such a situation, we may have a risk of non-payment or non-collection on invoicing. Additionally, notwithstanding the customer’s ability or willingness to pay for or otherwise facilitate the completion of the services, we may be legally or ethically bound to complete or wind down the services at our own expense. Our backlog as of June 30, 2023 was $9.65 billion, a decrease from $11.46 billion as of June 30, 2022. A decrease in backlog may lead to lower revenue. Although an increase in backlog will generally result in an increase in revenues over time, an increase in backlog at a particular point in time does not necessarily correspond directly to an increase in revenues during any particular period, or at all. The extent to which contracts in backlog will result in revenue depends on many factors, including, but not limited to, delivery against project schedules, scope changes, customer engagement and satisfaction, contract terminations, and the nature, duration, and complexity of the contracts, and can vary significantly over time. As described above, we have experienced decreases in backlog over the past twelve months and therefore expect our revenues to decline (on a period over period basis) during the remainder of 2023. In the first and second quarters of 2023 we believe we began to experience stabilization, relative to the prior periods, in the trend reversals with increases in backlog and of the net new business awards which contribute to backlog.",N/A,as_expected,2023,344

Other pandemics or outbreaks of disease may have similar impacts in the future. Any ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to adversely impact our business and results of operations in a number of ways, including but not limited to: - delays or difficulties in commencing new and operating ongoing clinical trials: - restrictions on the ability of our field teams to visit HCPs and difficulty securing appropriate PPE and testing and other tools required for client-facing engagements and visits to sites/HCPs; - diversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trials, including the diversion of hospitals serving as our clinical trial sites and hospital staff supporting the conduct of our clinical trials, as well as the reduction of our customers’ operating budgets; - interruption of key clinical trial activities, such as clinical trial site data monitoring, due to social distancing requirements, quarantine and isolation protocols or interruption of clinical trial subject visits and study procedures, which may impact the collection and integrity of study data and ability to measure clinical trial endpoints; - business disruptions at our customers; - limitations on our employee resources; - diversion of management resources; and - impacts from prolonged remote work arrangements, such as strains on our business continuity plans, cybersecurity risks, and inability of certain employees to perform their work remotely. These and other impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic or other pandemics or outbreaks of disease could also have the effect of heightening many of the other risk factors included elsewhere in this offering circular.

In particular, our large pharma customer base is smaller than our peers and the loss of one large pharma customer may have an outsize impact on our results of operations or cash flows as compared to our peers. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, our top ten customers, based on revenue, accounted for approximately 39% of our consolidated revenue and our top ten Clinical Solutions customers, based on backlog, accounted for approximately 39% of our total backlog. No single customer accounted for greater than 10% of our total consolidated revenue for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 and for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. It is possible that an even greater portion of our revenues will be attributable to a smaller number of customers in the future, including as a result of our entering into strategic provider relationships with customers. Also, consolidation in our potential customer base results in increased competition for important market segments and fewer available customer accounts. A significant concentration of our customers are categorized as SMID companies, which represented approximately 45% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. Economic conditions that adversely impact this customer group may have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations or cash flows as compared to our peers. In particular, a portion of our SMID customer base is pre-revenue companies that do not generate cash flows from operations and is reliant on outside funding sources, which may be limited in a ----- recessionary environment. Additionally, conducting multiple clinical trials for different sponsors in a single therapeutic class involving drugs with the same or similar chemical action may adversely affect our business if some or all of the trials are canceled because of new scientific information or regulatory judgments that affect the drugs as a class. Similarly, marketing and selling products for different sponsors with similar drug action subjects us to risk if new scientific information or regulatory judgment prejudices the products as a class, leading to compelled or voluntary prescription limitations or withdrawal of some or all of the products from the market.",N/A,as_expected,2023,344

We bear the financial risk if we initially underprice our contracts or otherwise overrun our cost estimates, which could adversely affect our cash flows and financial performance. In addition, contracts with our customers are subject to change orders, which occur when the scope of work we perform needs to be modified from that originally contemplated in our contract with the customers. This can occur, for example, when there is a change in a key study assumption or parameter or a significant change in timing. We may be unable to successfully negotiate changes in scope or change orders on a timely basis or at all, which could require us to incur cost outlays ahead of the receipt of any additional revenue. In addition, under GAAP we cannot recognize additional revenue anticipated from change orders until appropriate documentation is received by us from the customer authorizing the change. However, if we incur additional expense in anticipation of receipt of that documentation, we must recognize the expense as incurred.

1749_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.8,"Our business depends on the continued effectiveness and availability of our information systems, including the information systems we use to provide services to our customers and to store employee data, and failures of these systems may materially limit our operations or have an adverse effect on our reputation.","Our information systems consist of systems we have purchased or developed, legacy information systems from organizations we have acquired and, increasingly, web-enabled and other integrated information systems. In using these information systems, we frequently rely on third-party vendors to provide hosting and system management services, where our infrastructure is dependent upon the reliability of their underlying platforms, facilities, and communications systems. We also utilize integrated information systems that we provide customers access to or install for our customers in conjunction with our delivery of services. As the breadth and complexity of our information systems continue to grow, we will increasingly be exposed to the risks inherent in maintaining the stability of our legacy systems due to prior customization, attrition of employees or vendors involved in their development, and obsolescence of the underlying technology, as well as risks from external cybersecurity attacks or data breaches on multi-national companies, usage errors by our employees, and software bugs. Because certain customers, clinical trials, and other long-term projects depend upon these legacy systems, we also face an increased level of embedded risk in maintaining the legacy systems and ----- limited options to mitigate such risk. We are also exposed to risks associated with the availability of all our information systems, including: - disruption, impairment or failure of data centers, telecommunications facilities or other key infrastructure platforms, including those maintained by our third-party vendors; - security breaches of, cyberattacks on, and other failures or malfunctions in our information technology (“IT”) systems, including our employee data and communications, critical application systems or their associated hardware, software, and databases; - excessive costs, excessive delays, or other deficiencies in systems development and deployment; and - potential for encryption based “Ransomware” attacks that could hinder our ability to access our systems and data until we are able to recover from backups. In addition to these availability risks, due to the interconnectedness of IT systems across platforms and hosts, we could see disruptions to our systems as “collateral damage” from attacks targeting our connected partners. The materialization of any of these risks may impede the processing of data, the delivery of databases and services, and the day-to-day management of our business and could result in the corruption, loss, or unauthorized disclosure of proprietary, confidential, or other data. In addition, a security breach could require that we expend substantial additional resources related to the security of our technical infrastructure, databases, and services, diverting resources from other projects and disrupting our business. Despite any precautions we take, our IT systems and those of our third-party vendors, strategic partners, and other contractors are vulnerable to attack, damage, or interruption from fire, floods, hurricanes, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, break-ins, hacking, phishing attacks and other social engineering schemes, employee theft or misuse, human error, fraud, denial or degradation of service attacks, sophisticated nation-state and nation-state-supported actors, or unauthorized access or use by persons inside our organization, or persons with access to systems inside our organization. Corruption or loss of data may result in the need to repeat a project at no cost to the customer, but at significant cost to us, the termination of a contract, civil or criminal enforcement actions and penalties, or damage to our reputation. Additionally, significant delays in system enhancements or inadequate performance of new or upgraded systems once completed could damage our reputation and harm our business. Finally, long-term disruptions in the infrastructure caused by events such as natural disasters, the outbreak of war, the escalation of hostilities and acts of terrorism, particularly involving cities in which we have offices, and cyberattacks such as those recently faced by other multi-national companies could adversely affect our businesses. As our business continues to expand globally, these types of risks may be further increased by instability in the geopolitical climate of certain regions, underdeveloped and less stable utilities and communications infrastructure, and other local and regional factors. Although we carry property, cyber incident, and business interruption insurance that we believe is customary for our industry, our coverage might not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur. We have been and expect that we will continue to be subject to attempts to gain unauthorized access to or through our information systems or those we internally or externally develop for our customers. We also rely on service providers for certain information systems who have experienced attempts to gain such unauthorized access. In addition, we and our service providers may be susceptible to physical or computer-based attacks by terrorists, nation states, or hackers due to our role in the biopharmaceutical service industry. Bad actors may be motivated by a desire to access or steal our or our clients’ intellectual property. These concerns about security are increased when information is transmitted over the Internet. Increased frequency of remote work may increase the risk of such attacks. If such attacks are not detected immediately, their effect could be compounded. Even if identified, we may be unable to adequately investigate or remediate incidents or breaches due to attackers increasingly using tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, to avoid detection, and to remove or obfuscate forensic evidence. To date these attacks have not had a significant impact on our operations or financial results. However, successful attacks in the future could result in negative publicity, significant remediation and recovery costs, legal liability and damage to our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. We maintain cyber insurance; however, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial, legal, business, or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our systems. ----- Additionally, we rely on service providers for the timely transmission of information across our global data network. If a service provider fails to provide the communications capacity or services we require for similar reasons, the failure could interrupt our services. Because of the centrality of our processing systems to our business, any interruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of our brands’ reliability and harm our business. If a service provider experiences the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential data they are processing on our behalf, whether through systems failure or employee actions, cyberattacks, fraud, or misappropriation, it could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers. Similarly, such disclosure could result in negative publicity, significant remediation and recovery costs, legal liability, and damage to our reputation, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, contractual indemnity, the service provider’s liability insurance and our liability insurance might not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyberattacks, and other related breaches.",N/A,as_expected,2023,344

For example, the war in Ukraine has not had a material impact on our revenue to date; however, that could change depending on the magnitude of the conflict and the imposition of additional sanctions by the U.S. and other countries or the spread of the conflict to surrounding areas. Banking and economic sanctions imposed on Russia continue to present challenges to clinical trials. We are monitoring these sanctions to ensure we are in compliance and we are adapting our operations to address both the sanctions and the increasing logistical challenges of conducting trials in Russia. At this time, we are continuing to service patients in Ukraine and Russia in existing trials where possible.

Tax authorities in the U.S. and in international markets have the right to examine our corporate structure and how we account for intercompany transactions. If such authorities challenge our corporate structure, transfer pricing mechanisms or intercompany transactions and the resulting assessments are upheld, our operations may be negatively impacted, and our effective tax rate may increase. Tax rates vary from country to country and if a tax authority determines that our profits in one jurisdiction should be increased, we might not be able to realize the full tax benefits in the event we cannot utilize all foreign tax credits that are generated, or we do not realize a compensating offsetting adjustment in another taxing jurisdiction. The effects of either would increase our effective tax rate. The U.S. or other jurisdictions may also change their tax laws from time to time, which could cause our effective tax rate to increase or decrease. For example, the U.S. Congress recently enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which was signed into law by President Biden on August 16, 2022. Among other things, the Inflation Reduction Act provided funding for increased tax enforcement, imposed a 1% excise tax on certain share repurchases by publicly traded corporations, and imposed a 15% minimum tax on certain large corporations. We are unable to predict whether or when any other tax changes will be enacted. The UK R&D tax relief regime has in recent years been, and continues to be, subject to review and amendment. On July 21, 2022, draft legislation was published setting out, among other things, details of proposed restrictions that (if enacted) could limit our ability (except in limited circumstances) to make claims under the existing relief programs with respect to accounting periods beginning on or after April 1, 2023 for expenditures ----- incurred on foreign sub-contracted R&D work and externally provided workers that are not paid through UK payroll. These and other potential future changes to the UK research and development tax relief regime may limit the extent to which we qualify and can make claims under the regime. Additionally, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has issued certain guidelines regarding base erosion and profit shifting. As these guidelines continue to be formally adopted by separate taxing jurisdictions, we may need to change our approach to intercompany transfer pricing in order to maintain compliance under the new guidelines. Our effective tax rate may increase or decrease depending on the current location of global operations at the time of the change. Finally, we might not always be in compliance with all applicable customs, exchange control, Value Added Tax, and transfer pricing laws despite our efforts to be aware of and to comply with such laws.

If such vendors or their products fail to perform as required or if there are substantial delays in developing, implementing, securing, and updating our IT platforms, our customer delivery may be impaired, and we may have to make substantial further investments, internally or with third parties, to achieve our objectives. For example, we rely on an external vendor to provide the clinical trial management software used in managing the completion of our customer clinical trials. If that externally provided system is not properly maintained, we might not be able to meet the obligations of our contracts or may need to incur significant costs to replace the system or capability. Additionally, our progress may be limited by parties with existing or claimed patents who seek to enjoin us from using preferred technology or seek license payments from us. Meeting our objectives is dependent on a number of factors which might not take place as we anticipate, including obtaining adequate technology-enabled services, depending upon our third-party vendors to develop and enhance existing applications to adequately support our business, creating IT-enabled services that our customers will find desirable, and implementing our business model with respect to these services.

Our services include monitoring clinical trials, data and laboratory analysis, project management, patient recruitment, safety reporting, product launch consulting, product deployment solutions, advertising, publications, and medical communications, and other related services. Such services are complex and subject to contractual requirements, regulatory standards, and ethical considerations. For example, we must adhere to applicable regulatory requirements such as those required by the FDA, the EMA and the competent authorities of the member states of the EU, and the MHRA in the UK, including those laws and regulations governing the promotion, sales, and marketing of biopharmaceutical products, and GCP requirements, which govern, among other things, the design, conduct, performance, monitoring, auditing, recording, analysis, and reporting of clinical trials. Once initiated, clinical trials must be conducted pursuant to and in accordance with the applicable investigational new drug/device application or clinical trial application, the requirements of the relevant institutional review boards (as defined herein) or ethics committees, and GCP requirements. For studies involving controlled substances, we are also subject to regulation by the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) which regulates the distribution, recordkeeping, handling, security, and disposal of controlled substances. If we fail to perform our services in accordance with applicable requirements, regulatory agencies may take action against us or our customers. Such actions may include sanctions such as injunctions or refusal of such regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of products, imposition of clinical holds or delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, rejection of data collected in studies, license revocation, product seizures or recalls, operational restrictions, civil or criminal penalties or prosecutions, damages, or fines. Additionally, there is a risk that actions by regulatory authorities, if they result in significant inspectional observations or other measures, could harm our reputation and cause customers not to award us future contracts or to cancel existing contracts. Customers may also bring claims against us for breach of our contractual obligations, and patients in the clinical trials and patients taking drugs/using devices approved on the basis of those trials may bring personal injury claims against us. Any such action could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or reputation. Such consequences could arise if, among other things, the following occur: _Improper performance of our services. The performance of our clinical development and other biopharmaceutical_ services is complex and time-consuming. For example, we may make mistakes in conducting a clinical trial that could negatively impact or obviate the usefulness of the clinical trial or cause the results of the clinical trial to be reported improperly. If the clinical trial results are compromised, we could be subject to significant costs or liability, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to perform our services and our reputation could be harmed. For example: - significant non-compliance generally could result in the termination of ongoing clinical trials or the disqualification of data for submission to regulatory authorities; - a compromise of patient safety and/or the scientific integrity of the trial could require us to repeat the clinical trial under the terms of our contract at no further cost to our customer, but at a substantial cost to us; and - a material breach of a contractual term could result in liability for damages or termination of the contract. Large clinical trials can cost hundreds of millions of dollars and improper performance of our services could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, damage our reputation, and result in the termination of current contracts or failure to obtain future contracts from the affected customer or other customers. _Interactive Voice/Web Response Technology malfunction. We develop, maintain, and use third-party computer-_ based interactive voice/web response systems to automatically manage the randomization of patients in a given clinical trial to different treatment arms and regulate the supply of investigational drugs, all by means of interactive voice/web response systems. An error in the design, programming, or validation of these systems could lead to inappropriate assignment or dosing of patients which could give rise to patient safety issues, invalidation of the trial, or liability claims against us. Furthermore, negative publicity associated with such a malfunction could have an ----- adverse effect on our business and reputation. Additionally, errors in randomization may require us to repeat the clinical trial at no further cost to our customer, but at a substantial cost to us. _Investigation of customers. From time to time, one or more of our customers have been, and may in the future be,_ audited or investigated by regulatory authorities or enforcement agencies with respect to regulatory compliance of their clinical trials, programs, or the marketing and sale of their drugs. In these situations, we have often provided services to our customers with respect to the clinical trials, programs, or activities being audited or investigated, and we are called upon to respond to requests for information by the authorities and agencies. There is a risk that either our customers or the regulatory authorities could claim that we performed our services improperly or that we are responsible for clinical trial or program compliance. If our customers or the regulatory authorities make such claims against us and prove them, we could be subject to damages, fines, or penalties. In addition, negative publicity regarding regulatory compliance of our customers’ clinical trials, programs, or drugs could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation. _Insufficient customer funding to complete services. As noted above, clinical trials can cost hundreds of millions of_ dollars. There is a risk that we may initiate a clinical trial or commercial offering for a customer, and then the customer becomes unwilling or unable to fund the completion of the service. In such a situation, we may have a risk of non-payment or non-collection on invoicing. Additionally, notwithstanding the customer’s ability or willingness to pay for or otherwise facilitate the completion of the service, we may be legally or ethically bound to complete or wind down the services at our own expense. This risk is heightened in a recessionary or weak funding environment for our customers, who may be unable to raise or expend funds necessary to complete a trial, and our services may account for large portions of their budgets. Our SMID customer base, some of which are in pre-revenue operational positions, may experience heightened exposure during this environment. In addition to the above U.S. laws and regulations, we must comply with the laws of all countries where we do business, including laws governing clinical trials in the jurisdiction where the trials are performed.

Some of these trials involve the administration of investigational drugs to known substance abusers or volunteers and patients that are already seriously ill and are at risk for further illness or death. Failure to operate any of our early phase facilities in accordance with applicable regulations could result in that facility being shut down, which could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and reputation.

Principal investigators are typically located at hospitals, clinics, or other sites and supervise the administration of the investigational drug to patients during the course of a clinical trial. Patients generally include people from the communities in which the clinical trials are conducted. Several of our competitors have purchased site networks or site management organizations as a strategy for priority access to a specific site, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Our clinical development business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract suitable and willing principal investigators or recruit and enroll patients for clinical trials on a consistent basis. The expanding global nature of clinical trials increases the risk associated with attracting suitable principal investigators and patients, especially if these trials are conducted in regions where our resources or experience may be more limited. For example, if we are unable to engage principal investigators to conduct clinical trials as planned or enroll sufficient patients in clinical trials, we might need to expend additional funds to obtain access to more principal investigators and patients than planned or else be compelled to delay or modify the clinical trial plans, which may result in additional costs to us or cancellation of the clinical trial by our customer.

Our primary exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is related to the following risks: _Foreign Currency Risk from Differences in Customer Contract Currency and Operating Costs Currency. The_ majority of our global contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars or Euros while our operating costs in foreign countries are denominated in various local currencies. Fluctuations in the exchange rates of the currencies we use to contract with our customers and the currencies in which we incur cost to fulfill those contracts can have a significant impact on our results of operations. Foreign Currency Translation Risk._ The revenue and expenses of our international operations are generally denominated in local currencies and translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes.

Our goodwill is principally related to the acquisition of inVentiv completed in August 2017. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is one level below the operating segment level. This test requires us to determine if the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is less than its carrying amount. The impairment analysis requires significant judgments, estimates and assumptions. There is no assurance that the actual future earnings or cash flows of the reporting units will not decline significantly from the projections used in the impairment analysis. Goodwill impairment charges may be recognized in future periods in one or more of the reporting units to the extent changes in factors or circumstances occur, including deterioration in the macroeconomic environment or industry, deterioration in our performance or our future projections, or changes in plans for one or more of our reporting units. As of June 30, 2023, our goodwill is assigned to four reporting units. We completed our annual impairment test as of October 1, 2022 for all of our reporting units and concluded that there were no impairments. However, during the fourth quarter of 2022, we performed a quantitative analysis for our Communications reporting unit, which had a goodwill balance of $529.1 million as of December 31, 2022. We concluded that the estimated fair value of our Communications reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately $19.0 million, or 3%, and therefore no impairment existed. Given this small excess in the estimated fair value over the carrying value, the Company may be at increased risk of a non-cash impairment charge in the future. Intangible assets consist of customer relationships, acquired backlog, trade names, trademarks, patient communities, and acquired technologies. We review intangible assets at the end of each reporting period to determine if facts and circumstances indicate that the useful life is shorter than originally estimated or that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. If such facts and circumstances exist, we assess the recoverability of identified assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives to their respective carrying amounts. Impairments, if any, are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets and occur in the period in which the impairment determination was made. We have experienced material impairment losses in the past, and could experience additional material impairment losses in the future. The process of testing intangible assets for impairment involves numerous judgments, assumptions, and estimates made by management including expected future profitability, cash flows, and the fair values of assets and liabilities, which inherently reflect a high degree of uncertainty and may be affected by significant variability. If the business climate deteriorates, then actual results may not be consistent with these judgments, assumptions, and estimates, and our intangible assets may become impaired in future periods. Various factors could reasonably be expected to unfavorably impact the assumptions underlying our impairment analysis, including delays in awards and the related delay in revenue, increases in termination activity, continued deterioration of macroeconomic conditions, or increases in operating costs.

As a consequence, we may not be able to realize cost savings within the timeframe expected or at all. In addition, we may incur additional and/or unexpected costs in order to realize these cost savings. Failure to achieve the expected cost savings could significantly reduce the expected benefits associated with the Merger. Our presentation of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA in this offering circular reflects such cost savings but does not reflect such expenditures. Accordingly, you should not view our presentation of these adjustments in our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as a projection that we will achieve these cost savings but rather only as an indication of our current expectations and to show how Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA will be calculated for the purposes of monitoring covenant compliance in the credit agreements governing our New Credit Facilities and the indenture that will govern the Notes. In addition, we have incurred and will incur substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and consummation of the Transactions. We expect to continue to incur non-recurring costs associated with consummating the Merger and achieving the desired cost savings. These fees and costs have been, and will continue to be, substantial. The substantial majority of non-recurring expenses will consist of transaction costs related to the Merger and include, among others, fees paid to financial, legal and accounting advisors, employee benefit costs and filing fees.

While the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information presented in this offering circular is based on assumptions regarding the Transactions and other estimates that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, this information is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to, and does not purport to, represent what our actual results or financial condition would have been if the Transactions had been consummated. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information presented in this offering circular reflects the impact of the Merger on our historical financial information using the acquisition method of accounting, as required under GAAP. Pursuant to the acquisition method, we will record our tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of consideration transferred (i.e., purchase price) over the fair value of net assets acquired will be recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment.

1749_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Risks Related to Our Industry,13.2.1,The biopharmaceutical services industry is highly competitive and our business could be materially impacted if we do not compete effectively or rapidly adapt to technological change.,"The biopharmaceutical services industry is highly competitive. Our business often competes with other biopharmaceutical services companies, internal discovery departments, development departments, sales and marketing departments, IT departments, and other departments within our customers, some of which could be considered large biopharmaceutical services companies in their own right with greater resources than ours. To the extent that our clients choose to internally perform the clinical development and commercialization tasks that we provide or to work with our competitors, our business will suffer. We also compete with universities, teaching hospitals, governmental agencies, and others. If we do not compete successfully, our business will suffer. The industry is highly fragmented, with numerous smaller specialized companies and a handful of companies with global capabilities similar to certain of our own capabilities. Increased competition has led to price and other forms of competition (such as acceptance of less favorable contract terms) that could adversely affect our operating results. There are few barriers to entry for companies considering offering any one or more of the services we offer. Because of their size and focus, these companies might compete effectively against us, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. In recent years, our industry has experienced increased consolidation which may continue and might put us at risk of growing more slowly than our competitors that make acquisitions. This trend is likely to produce more competition from the resulting larger companies, and ones without the cost pressures of being public, for both customers and acquisition candidates. One specific aspect of this consolidation competition involves CROs entering into transactions to attempt to control more access to clinical trial participants, like acquisition of site networks and data. These trends could make it harder for us to compete successfully. In addition, the emergence of the use of RWE and new approaches such as machine learning and artificial intelligence that capitalize on the availability of large data sets may reduce the time and costs of the discovery and development process, may allow our clients to more readily perform clinical development tasks and services that we provide themselves, or may cause price competition. More broadly, our current competitors or other businesses might develop technologies or services that are more effective or commercially attractive than, or render obsolete, our current or future technologies and services. We may also fail to fully leverage the technologies available to us or develop technologies quickly enough to be competitively useful, which we have experienced to a certain degree. Our failure to develop and offer competitive services that address these and other technological advances in a timely, cost-effective manner or to keep pace with rapid technological change could adversely affect our competitive position and our results of operations. Our future growth and success will depend on our ability to successfully compete with other companies that provide similar services in the same markets, some of which may have financial, marketing, technical, staffing, and other advantages. We also expect that competition will continue to increase as a result of consolidation among these various companies. Large technology companies with substantial resources, technical expertise, and greater brand power could also decide to enter or further expand in the markets where our business operates and compete with us. If one or more of our competitors or potential competitors were to merge or partner with another of our competitors, or if a new entrant emerged with substantial resources, the change in the competitive landscape could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. We compete on the basis of various factors, including breadth and depth of services, customer engagement, reputation, reliability, quality, innovation, security, price, and industry expertise and experience. In addition, our ability to compete successfully may be impacted by the growing availability of health information from social media, government health information systems, and other free or lowcost sources. In addition, consolidation or integration of wholesalers, retail pharmacies, health networks, payers, or other healthcare stakeholders may lead any of them to provide information services directly to customers or indirectly through a designated service provider, resulting in increased competition from firms that may have lower ----- costs to market (e.g., no data supply costs). Any of the above may result in lower demand for our services, which could result in a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2023,344

Accordingly, economic factors and industry trends that affect biopharmaceutical companies affect our business. Biopharmaceutical companies continue to seek long-term strategic collaborations with global CROs with favorable pricing terms. Competition for these collaborations is intense and we might not be selected, in which case a competitor may enter into the collaboration and our business with the customer, if any, may be limited. Our success depends in part on our ability to establish and maintain preferred provider relationships with large biopharmaceutical companies. Our failure to develop or maintain these preferred provider relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Furthermore, in order to obtain preferred provider relationships or other large contracts for commercialization services, we may have to reduce the prices for our services, which could negatively impact our gross margin for these services. Our SMID biopharmaceutical company clients may rely on funding from venture capital and other sources to drive their business. During the year ended December 31, 2022, this funding was lower than historical periods. When this funding is reduced, our SMID biopharmaceutical company clients have been and may in the future be forced to reduce their outsourced R&D and commercialization expenditures or may be unable to pay for services rendered, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, when the biopharmaceutical industry reduces its outsourcing of clinical trials or commercialization services or such outsourcing fails to grow at projected rates, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. We may also be negatively impacted by consolidation and other factors in the biopharmaceutical industry, which may slow decision making by our customers, result in the delay or cancellation of existing projects, cause reductions in overall R&D expenditures, or lead to increased pricing pressures. Further, in the event that one of our customers combines with a company that is using the services of one of our competitors, the combined company could decide to use the services of that competitor or another provider. All of these events could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2023,344

Similarly, customers may act to voluntarily limit the sales of biopharmaceutical products or withdraw them from the market. Actions by payers to limit a product on a formulary list or restrict coverage or reimbursement for a product can influence customer decisions to withdraw or limit market support for a product. In the past, we have provided services with respect to products that have been limited or withdrawn. If we are providing services to customers for products that are limited or withdrawn, we may be required to narrow the scope of or terminate our services with respect to such products, which would prevent us from earning the full amount of revenues anticipated under the related contracts with negative impacts to our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2023,344

Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exceptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If we or our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could materially adversely affect our ability to operate our business, our financial results, and our reputation.",N/A,as_expected,2023,344
1749_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Risks Related to Our Industry,13.2.5,We may be affected by healthcare reform and potential additional reforms which may adversely impact the biopharmaceutical industry and reduce the need for our services or negatively impact our profitability.,"Numerous government bodies are considering or have adopted healthcare reforms and may undertake, or are in the process of undertaking, efforts to control healthcare costs through legislation, regulation, and agreements with HCPs and biopharmaceutical companies, including many of our customers. As governmental administrations change and reforms take place, we are unable to predict what legislative proposals, if any, will be adopted in the future. If regulatory cost-containment efforts limit the profitability of new drugs by, for example, continuing to place downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing and/or increasing regulatory burdens and operating costs of the biopharmaceutical industry, our customers may reduce their commercialization and R&D spending, which could reduce the business they outsource to us. In addition, if regulatory requirements are relaxed or simplified drug approval procedures are adopted, the demand for our services could decrease. Government bodies have adopted and may continue to adopt new healthcare legislation or regulations that are more burdensome than existing regulations. For example, product safety concerns and recommendations by the Drug Safety Oversight Board could change the regulatory environment for drug products, and new or heightened regulatory requirements may increase our expenses or limit our ability to offer some of our services. We might have to incur additional costs to comply with these or other new regulations, and failure to comply could harm our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and reputation, and result in adverse legal action(s). Additionally, new or heightened regulatory requirements may have a negative impact on the ability of our customers to conduct industry-sponsored clinical trials, which could reduce the need for our post-approval development services. For instance, in the EU, the Clinical Trials Regulation (“CTR”), which was adopted in April 2014, became applicable on January 31, 2022. While the Clinical Trials Directive required a separate clinical trial application (“CTA”) to be submitted in each member state, to both the competent national health authority and an independent ethics committee, the CTR introduces a centralized process and only requires the submission of a single application to all member states concerned. The CTR allows sponsors to make a single submission to both the competent authority and an ethics committee in each member state, leading to a single decision per member state. The assessment procedure of the CTA has been harmonized as well, including a joint assessment by all member states concerned, and a separate assessment by each member state with respect to specific requirements related to its own territory, including ethics rules. Each member state’s decision is communicated to the sponsor via the centralized EU portal. Once the CTA is approved, clinical study development may proceed. The CTR foresees a three-year transition period. The extent to which ongoing and new clinical trials will be governed by the CTR varies. For clinical trials whose CTA was made under the Clinical Trials Directive before January 31, 2022, the Clinical Trials Directive will continue to apply on a transitional basis for three years. Additionally, sponsors were permitted to choose to submit a CTA under either the Clinical Trials Directive or the CTR until January 31, 2023 and, if authorized, those were governed by the Clinical Trials Directive until January 31, 2025. By that date, all ongoing trials will become subject to the provisions of the CTR. Compliance with the CTR requirements by us and our thirdparty service providers, such as CROs, may impact our development plans. It is currently unclear to what extent the UK will seek to align its regulations with the EU. The UK regulatory framework in relation to clinical trials is derived from existing EU legislation (as implemented into UK law, through secondary legislation). On January 17, 2022, the MHRA launched an eight-week consultation on reframing the UK legislation for clinical trials. The consultation closed on March 14, 2022 and aims to streamline clinical trials approvals, enable innovation, enhance clinical trials transparency, enable greater risk proportionality, and promote patient and public involvement in clinical trials. The outcome of the consultation will be closely watched and will determine whether the UK chooses to align with the regulation or diverge from it to maintain regulatory flexibility. A decision by the UK not to closely align its regulations with the new approach that has been adopted in the EU may have an effect on ----- the cost of conducting clinical trials in the UK as opposed to other countries and/or make it harder to seek a marketing authorization in the EU for product candidates on the basis of clinical trials conducted in the UK.",N/A,as_expected,2023,344
1749_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Risks Related to Our Industry,13.2.6,Current and proposed laws and regulations regarding the protection of personal data could result in increased risks of liability or increased cost to us or could limit our service offerings.,"The global data protection landscape is rapidly evolving, and we are or may become subject to numerous state, federal and foreign laws, requirements, and regulations governing the collection, use, disclosure, retention, and security of personal information, such as information we may collect about individuals in the U.S., the EEA, the UK, and other countries where we have operations, including but not limited to Japan, China, South Korea, Brazil, and Singapore. Federal, state, and foreign governments may propose or have adopted additional legislation governing the collection, possession, use, storage, or disclosure of personal data, including but not limited to health and financial data, as well as security breach notification rules for loss or theft of such data. Additional legislation or regulation of this type might, among other things, require us to implement additional security measures and processes or to anonymize or de-identify health or other personal data in excess of what we are already obliged to do, each of which may require substantial expenditures or limit our ability to offer some of our services. Failure to comply with these data protection and privacy laws, rules, and regulations, or to resolve any privacy or security complaints, could subject us to regulatory sanctions, fines, delays in clinical trials, criminal prosecution, or civil liability, as well as reputational damage. In the U.S., we are subject to certain state privacy and data security laws and regulations in the states in which we operate, such as the CCPA, which became effective as of January 2020, and creates individual privacy rights for California consumers and increases the privacy and security obligations of entities handling certain personal information. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”) recently passed in California. The CPRA will impose additional data protection obligations on covered businesses, including additional consumer rights processes, limitations on data uses, new audit requirements for higher risk data, and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It will also create a new California data protection agency authorized to issue substantive regulations and could result in increased privacy and information security enforcement. The majority of the provisions will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and additional compliance investment and potential business process changes may be required. Similar laws have passed in Virginia and Colorado, and have been proposed in other states and at the federal level, reflecting a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the U.S. The enactment of such laws could have potentially conflicting requirements that would make compliance challenging. In the event that we are subject to or affected by the CCPA, the CPRA, or other domestic privacy and data protection laws, any liability from failure to comply with the requirements of these laws could adversely affect our financial condition. In the EEA, we are subject to the EU GDPR, and in the UK, we are subject to the UK data protection regime consisting primarily of the UK General Data Protection Regulation, or UK GDPR, and the UK Data Protection Act 2018, (collectively, the GDPR), in each case in relation to our collection, control, processing, sharing, disclosure, and other use of data relating to an identifiable living individual (personal data). The GDPR contains provisions specifically directed at the processing of health data, rights of data subjects, data breach notification, and extra-territoriality measures intended to extend the applicability of the law to certain activities performed by non-EEA/UK organizations (such as the targeting or monitoring of individuals located in the EEA/UK by organizations located in other locations). Failure by us, or by our partners, our service providers, or our employees or contractors, to comply with the GDPR could result in regulatory investigations, reputational damage, orders to cease/ change our use of data, enforcement notices and/ or fines of the greater of €20 million/£17.5 million or 4% of total global annual revenue, as well as potential civil claims including class actions where individuals suffer harm. These changes may lead to additional compliance costs and could increase our overall risk. As we expand into other foreign countries and jurisdictions, we may be subject to additional laws and regulations that may affect how we conduct business. In addition to data protection laws and regulations, regulators are considering (or are adopting) other laws, regulations and guidelines that impact the processing of personal information. For example, the evolving landscape surrounding the use of artificial intelligence and online advertising may lead to additional compliance costs and could increase our overall risk. ----- In addition, we operate on a global basis and may transfer personal data to our affiliates and service providers in the course of administering our business and performing our services. As a result, we are subject to legal requirements that govern the cross-border transfer of personal data. For example, the GDPR prohibits the transfer of personal data outside the EEA and the UK to third countries that have not been found to provide adequate protection to such personal data, including the U.S., in the absence of certain safeguards. We rely upon Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”) and other appropriate safeguards or derogations for such transfers of personal data. The European Commission issued revised SCCs on June 4, 2021 to account for the decision of the CJEU and recommendations made by the European Data Protection Board. The revised SCCs must be used for relevant new data transfers from September 27, 2021; existing standard contractual clauses arrangements must be migrated to the revised clauses by December 27, 2022. The new SCCs apply only to the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA and not the UK; the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office launched a public consultation on its draft revised data transfers mechanisms in August 2021. There is some uncertainty around whether the revised clauses can be used for all types of data transfers, particularly whether they can be relied on for data transfers to non-EEA entities subject to the GDPR. As noted in prior disclosures, certain of our clinical entities relied in part on the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks to transfer certain personal data from the EU and Switzerland, respectively, to the U.S. On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”) invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield. Similarly, on September 8, 2020, Switzerland’s Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (“FDPIC”) issued an opinion concluding that the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework does not provide an adequate level of protection to transfer Personal Data from Switzerland to the U.S. Because of these developments, we no longer leverage these frameworks to support the transfer of personal data from the EU and Switzerland to the U.S., although we continue participation in them, in an effort to demonstrate our commitment to the protection of personal data. We are accountable for the acts and omissions of our third-party service providers we engage to process personal data on our behalf, subject to limitations and exclusions provided by law. There is no assurance that contractual measures and our own privacy and security-related safeguards will protect us from the risks associated with the third-party processing, storage, and transmission of such information. Any violation of data protection laws by our third-party processors could have a material adverse effect on our business and result in the fines and penalties outlined above. Although we work to comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards, our contractual obligations, and other legal obligations, these requirements are evolving and may be modified, interpreted, and applied in an inconsistent manner from one jurisdiction to another, and may conflict with one another or other legal obligations with which we must comply. Any failure or perceived failure by us or our employees, representatives, contractors, consultants, collaborators, or other third parties to comply with such requirements or adequately address privacy and security concerns, even if unfounded, could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, and adversely affect our business and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2023,344

In the U.S., the EU and Japan, political pressure to reduce spending on prescription products has led to legislation and other measures which encourage the use of generic products. In addition, proposals emerge from time to time in the U.S. and other countries for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic products. Loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by generic substitutes, reducing our customers’ sales of that product and their overall profitability. Availability of generic substitutes for our customers’ products or other competing products may cause them to lose market share and, as a result, may adversely affect their results of operations and cash flow, which in turn may mean that they would not have adequate capital to purchase our services.

Our high degree of leverage could have important consequences, including: - making it more difficult for us to make payments on the New Credit Facilities, the Notes and our other obligations; - increasing our vulnerability to general economic and market conditions and to changes in the industries in which we compete; - requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, future working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, future strategic business opportunities, or other general corporate requirements; - making it difficult for us to optimally capitalize and manage the cash flow for our businesses; - restricting us from making acquisitions or causing us to make divestitures or similar transactions; - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, investments, acquisitions, and general corporate or other purposes; - limiting our ability to plan for, and adjust to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and for changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged; and ----- - increasing our cost of borrowing. Borrowings under our New Credit Facilities will be subject to variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations may increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. Additionally, our ability to comply with the financial and other covenants contained in our debt instruments may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions or other events beyond our control.

Under federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws, which may vary from state to state, the Notes or the guarantees thereof and any related security could be voided as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance if the Issuer or a guarantor, as applicable, (i) issued the Notes or incurred its guarantee with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or (ii) received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for either issuing the Notes or incurring the guarantee or any related security and, in the case of clause (ii) only, one of the following is also true at the time thereof: - the Issuer or such guarantor, as applicable, was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the Notes or the incurrence of its guarantees (and any related security); - the issuance of the Notes or the incurrence of its guarantees (or related security) left the Issuer or such guarantor, as applicable, with an unreasonably small amount of capital or assets to carry on the business as engaged in or anticipated; - the Issuer or such guarantor intended to, or believed that it would, incur indebtedness beyond its ability to pay as they mature; or ----- - the Issuer or such guarantor was a defendant in an action for money damages, or had a judgment for money damages docketed against it if, in either case, the judgment is unsatisfied after final judgment. As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is secured or satisfied. A court would likely find that a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for its guarantee or security interest to the extent the guarantor did not obtain a reasonably equivalent benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the Notes. Thus, if the guarantees were legally challenged, any guarantee could be subject to the claim that, since the guarantee was incurred for the Issuer’s benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit of the guarantor, the obligations of the applicable guarantor were incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration. Therefore, a court could void the obligations under the guarantees (and any related security interest), subordinate them to the applicable guarantor’s other debt or take other action detrimental to the holders of the Notes. The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon the law of the jurisdiction that is being applied, such that we cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether or not the Issuer or a guarantor was insolvent at the relevant time or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, that the Issuer or a guarantor was indeed insolvent on that date; that any payments to the holders of the Notes (including under the guarantees) did not constitute preferences, fraudulent conveyances or fraudulent transfers on other grounds; or whether the Notes or the guarantees and any related security would be subordinated to our or a guarantor’s other indebtedness. In general, however, a court would deem an entity insolvent if: - the sum of its indebtedness, including contingent and unliquidated liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all of its assets; - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing indebtedness, including contingent and unliquidated liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its indebtedness as they became due. If a court were to find that the issuance of the Notes or the incurrence of a guarantee and any related security was a fraudulent transfer or conveyance or other reviewable or avoidable transaction, the court could void the payment obligations under the Notes or that guarantee or security interest, could subordinate the Notes or that guarantee or security interest to presently existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer or of the relevant guarantor or could require the holders of the Notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the Notes or that guarantee or security interest. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent transfer or conveyance or other reviewable transaction occurred, you may not receive any repayment on the Notes. The indenture that will govern the Notes will also permit guarantees by foreign subsidiaries to be limited to the extent necessary to comply with applicable local law, and these limitations could limit the value of the guarantees. Further, the avoidance of the Notes could result in an event of default with respect to our and our subsidiaries’ other indebtedness that could result in acceleration of that indebtedness. Although the indenture that will govern the Notes will contain a “savings clause” intended to limit a guarantor’s liability under its guarantee to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the guarantee to be a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under applicable law, this provision may not be effective as a legal matter or otherwise to protect those guarantees from being avoided under fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer law or otherwise, or may reduce that guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its guarantee worthless. In addition, any payment by the Issuer or the relevant guarantors under the Notes or a guarantee could be avoided and required to be returned to such Issuer or guarantors, as the case may be, or deposited in a fund for the benefit of the creditors of such Issuer or guarantor. Among other things, a payment could potentially be avoided if such payment is made to an insider within a one-year period prior to a bankruptcy filing or within 90 days for any ----- non-insider party, and such payment would give such insider or non-insider party more than such party would have received in a distribution in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Finally, as a court of equity, the bankruptcy court may subordinate the claims in respect of the Notes to other claims against us under the principle of equitable subordination if the court determines that (i) the holder of Notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct, (ii) the inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holders of Notes and (iii) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.",N/A,as_expected,2023,344

Moreover, bankruptcy law permits the debtor to continue to retain and to use collateral (including cash collateral), and the proceeds, products, rents or profits of the collateral, even if the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection.” The meaning of the term “adequate protection” may vary according to circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the value of the secured creditor’s interest in the collateral and may include cash payments or the granting of additional or replacement security, if and at such time as the court in its discretion determines, for any diminution in the value of the collateral as a result of the stay of repossession or disposition or any use of the collateral by the debtor during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. In view of the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection” and the broad discretionary powers of a bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under the Notes could be made following the commencement of a bankruptcy case (or the length of the delay in making any such payment), whether or when the applicable collateral agent would repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value of the Collateral as of the commencement of a bankruptcy case or at any point in time thereafter, or whether or to what extent holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment of loss of value of the Collateral through the requirements of “adequate protection” or otherwise. Furthermore, in the event the bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes and all of our debts secured thereby on a senior or pari passu basis, the holders of the Notes would have “undersecured claims” as to the difference and would not be entitled to post-petition interest, fees, or expenses or “adequate protection” with respect to such difference.

None of the Trustee for the Notes, the Notes Collateral Agent or any other applicable collateral agent has any obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that could constitute Collateral securing the Notes or monitor the perfection of any security interest, or make any filings to perfect or maintain the perfection of any security interest. This may result in the loss of the security interest in the Collateral securing the Notes or the priority of the security interest in favor of the Notes against third parties. In addition, even if the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent does properly perfect such security interests, any such security interests perfected after the issue date for the Notes may potentially be avoidable as a preference in any bankruptcy proceeding under certain circumstances. See “—Any future pledge of Collateral or guarantee provided after the Notes are issued might be avoided in a bankruptcy.” In addition, the security interest of the applicable collateral agent will be subject to practical challenges generally associated with the realization of security interests in Collateral. For example, the applicable collateral agent may need to obtain the consent of third parties and make additional filings. If we are unable to obtain these consents or make these filings, the security interests may be invalid and the holders will not be entitled to the affected Collateral or any recovery with respect thereto. We cannot assure you that the applicable collateral agent will be able to obtain any such consent. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure or other security enforcement on such assets. Accordingly, the applicable collateral agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon or otherwise enforce against those assets and the value of the affected Collateral may significantly decrease. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,344

As a result, it is possible that the insurance proceeds will not compensate us fully for our losses in the event of a catastrophic loss.

In addition, certain assets, including Excluded Assets, will be excluded from the Collateral.","Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the New Credit Facilities, the security documents allow us to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from, the Collateral. For example, so long as no default or event of default under the indenture that will govern the Notes would result therefrom, we may, among other things, without any release or consent by the Trustee for the Notes, conduct activities with respect to the Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of the Collateral and making cash payments (including repayments of indebtedness). The lien on the Collateral will be automatically released upon any permitted disposition thereof to a person that is not the issuer or guarantor of the Notes. Any such actions could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes. See “Description of the Notes.” In addition, certain assets, including Excluded Assets, will be excluded from the Collateral. Some of these assets may be material to us and such exclusion could have a material adverse effect on the value of the Collateral.

1749_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.5,Risks Related to the Collateral Securing the Notes,13.5.10,Any future pledge of Collateral or guarantee provided after the Notes are issued might be avoided in a bankruptcy.,"The indenture that will govern the Notes and the Collateral documents will require us to cause any subsidiary that guarantees the New Credit Facilities to provide a guarantee of the Notes and will require us to cause such guarantor to grant liens on certain assets that we or any such guarantor holds at the time the Notes are issued or acquires after the Notes are issued. Any future guarantee or additional lien in favor of the applicable collateral agents for the benefit of the holders of the Notes might be avoidable by the grantor (as debtor-in possession) or by a trustee in bankruptcy or other third parties if certain events or circumstances exist or occur. For instance, if the entity granting a future guarantee or additional lien was insolvent at the time of the grant and if such grant was made within 90 days before that entity commenced a bankruptcy proceeding (or one year before commencement of a bankruptcy proceeding if the creditor that benefited from the guarantee or lien is an “insider” under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code), and the granting of the future guarantee or additional lien enabled the holders of the Notes to receive more than they would if the grantor were liquidated under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, then such guarantee or lien could be avoided as a preferential transfer. Liens recorded or perfected after the issue date may be treated under bankruptcy law as if they were delivered to secure previously existing indebtedness. In bankruptcy proceedings commenced within 90 days of lien perfection (or a potentially longer time period), a lien given to secure previously existing indebtedness is materially more likely to be avoided as a preference by the bankruptcy court than if delivered and promptly recorded on the issue date (or within a 30-day safe harbor provided for in the U.S. Bankruptcy Code). Accordingly, if we or any guarantor of the Notes were to file for bankruptcy or other insolvency protection after the issue date with respect to the Notes being offered hereby and the liens had been perfected less than 90 days before the commencement of such bankruptcy proceeding (or potentially a longer period), the liens securing the Notes may be particularly subject to challenge as a preference as a result of having been delivered after the issue date of the Notes. To the extent that such challenge were to succeed, the holders of the Notes would lose the benefit of the security that the Collateral was intended to provide.",N/A,as_expected,2023,344

There are also certain other assets that are also excluded from the Collateral.","The indenture that will govern the Notes will permit liens in favor of third parties to secure additional indebtedness, including purchase money indebtedness and capital lease obligations, and, in the case of certain of such liens, the liens on the related assets securing the Notes and the related guarantees may, under certain circumstances, be either subordinated to such permitted liens or released. Our ability to incur additional indebtedness and liens on such additional indebtedness in favor of third parties is subject to limitations as described herein under the headings “Description of the Notes.” In addition, certain assets are excluded from the Collateral, as discussed under “Description of the Notes—Security for the Notes.” If an event of default occurs and the maturity of the Notes is accelerated, the Notes and the related guarantees will rank pari passu with the holders of other unsecured indebtedness of the relevant obligor with respect to such excluded assets. As a result, if the value of the assets pledged as security for the Notes is less than the value of the claims of the holders of the Notes, those claims may not be satisfied in full before the claims of our unsecured creditors are paid. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,344

Represents the historical statements of operations of Syneos Health for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, the six months ended June 30, 2023, the six months ended June 30, 2022, and the year ended December 31, 2022. The historical statement of operations of Syneos Health for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 was derived by adding the statements of operations data for the year ended December 31, 2022 and the six months ended June 30, 2023, and subtracting the statement of operations data for the six months ended June 30, 2022. 2. Represents the Transaction Accounting Adjustments, giving effect to the Merger, as follows: a. Reflects incremental amortization resulting from the adjustment of certain Syneos Health assets to fair value in connection with acquisition accounting, including incremental expense resulting from the amortization of identifiable finite-lived intangible assets. In addition, changes in the useful lives of the identified intangible assets could materially impact amortization expense upon finalization. For each 10% increase or decrease in the preliminary fair value of finite-lived intangible assets, annual amortization expense would increase or decrease by approximately $33.3 million. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized using an expected benefits method of amortization. The estimated weighted average useful life of the pro forma finite-lived intangible assets is 17.2 years. The pro forma amortization expense over the first five year period following the Merger is $1,161.3 million. A one-year reduction in the weighted average useful life of the finite-lived intangible assets would result in an additional $17.7 million of amortization expense over the first five year period following the Merger. b. Represents $21.3 million of cash payments to be made to certain employees after the close of the Merger whose terms require continued employment through the first anniversary of the Merger. This cash payment has been reflected as an expense recognized ratably over the twelve month vesting period on a pro forma basis. Expense related to these cash payments of $21.3 million is recognized on a pro forma basis during the year ended December 31, 2022, $10.6 million is recognized on a pro forma basis during the six months ended June 30, 2022, and $10.6 million is recognized on a pro forma basis during the twelve months ended June 30, 2023. Such costs will be incurred or expected to be incurred related to the Merger subsequent to June 30, 2023. These costs will not affect the statements of operations beyond twelve months after the acquisition date. c. Represents additional fees and expenses anticipated to be incurred related to advisory fees, sponsors fees, other transactional costs, and legal, accounting, and other professional fees and expenses of $91.7 million on a pro forma basis during the year ended December 31, 2022 and the six months ended June 30, 2022 as well as ongoing annual management fees payable to the Sponsors each quarter beginning one quarter after the close of the Merger. The ongoing management fee of $15.0 million is recognized on a pro forma basis during the year ended December 31, 2022, $5.0 million is recognized on a pro forma basis during the six months ended June 30, 2022, $10.0 million is recognized on a pro forma basis during the six months ended June 30, 2023, and $20.0 million is recognized on a pro forma basis during the twelve months ended June 30, 2023. A significant portion of this adjustment will not impact the statement of operations beyond the twelve months from the date of the Merger. ----- d.

The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information herein has been adjusted to reflect the impacts of the Transactions including the following: - Transaction Accounting Adjustments. This represents pro forma adjustments to reflect the application of the accounting required by GAAP, giving effect to the Merger in the historical consolidated financial statements. - Financing and Other Adjustments.

The Merger will be accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”). The acquisition method of accounting requires use of the fair value concepts defined in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements (“ASC 820”). ASC 820 defines fair value as “the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.” The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information presented herein, including the allocation of the purchase price, is based on preliminary estimates of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, available information as of the date of this offering circular and the Issuer’s assumptions, and will be revised as additional information becomes available. The final purchase price allocation is dependent on, among other things, the completion of the asset and liability valuations. The actual purchase price allocation will vary from the pro forma adjustments based on final analyses of the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, particularly in regard to definite-lived tangible assets and deferred tax assets and liabilities, which could be material.

Our operations are divided into two reportable segments, Clinical Solutions and Commercial Solutions. Our Clinical Solutions segment offers comprehensive global services for the development of diagnostics, drugs, biologics, devices, and digital therapeutics that span Phases I to IV of clinical development. Our Commercial Solutions segment provides commercialization services, including field team deployment solutions, communications services (public relations, advertising, and medical communications), and consulting services. We integrate our clinical and commercial capabilities into customized solutions by sharing knowledge, data, and insights. This collaboration across the development and commercialization continuum facilitates unique insights into patient populations, therapeutic environments, product timelines, and the competitive landscape. For further discussion, refer to “Note 11 – Segment Information” to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this offering circular. We are pursuing business transformation initiatives to improve customer engagement, increase innovation, and achieve operating efficiencies. However, in connection with the pendency of the Merger, we have suspended certain aspects of these initiatives and, accordingly, we may not incur previously anticipated material costs in connection with such initiatives. These initiatives, if implemented, may not yield their intended improvements, or be completed in a timely manner, which may impact our competitiveness and our ability to meet our growth objectives and, as a result, materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Fluctuations in our net new business award levels often result from the fact that we may receive a small number of relatively large orders in any given reporting period. Because of these large orders, our backlog and net new business awards in a reporting period may reach levels that are not sustainable in subsequent reporting periods. We have experienced increased flow of requests for proposal (“RFP flow”) in the first half of 2023 compared to the second half of 2022 in both our Clinical Solutions and Commercial Solutions segments. In Clinical Solutions, the increased RFP flow was primarily driven by large pharmaceutical companies, with RFP flow from small to midsized (“SMID”) companies remaining relatively consistent. In Commercial Solutions, the increased RFP flow was driven by both large pharmaceutical and SMID companies. Additionally, net new business awards have been, and we expect will continue to be affected by the broad effects of the current macroeconomic environment on the global economy and major financial markets, including but not limited to interest rate increases and inflation. We believe that our backlog and net new business awards might not be consistent indicators of future revenue for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, changes to the scope of work during the course of projects, including the variable size and duration of projects, and our ability to win repeat business. Additionally, projects may be canceled or delayed by the customer or regulatory authorities. We generally do not have a contractual right to the full amount of the awards reflected in our backlog. If a customer cancels an award, we might be reimbursed for the costs we have incurred. As we increasingly compete for and enter into large contracts that are more global in nature, the rate at which our backlog and net new business awards convert into revenue may decrease, and the duration of projects and the period over which related revenue is recognized may lengthen.

Direct costs (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) $ 4,138,816 $ 3,994,484 $ 3,398,142 $ 144,332 3.6% $ 596,342 17.5% % of revenue 76.7% 76.6% 77.0% Gross margin % 23.3% 23.4% 23.0% For the year ended December 31, 2022, our direct costs increased by $144.3 million, or 3.6%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. _Clinical Solutions_ Direct costs for our Clinical Solutions segment, excluding share-based compensation expense, were as follows (dollars in thousands): Direct costs $ 3,027,509 $ 3,013,955 $ 2,519,465 $ 13,554 0.4% $ 494,490 19.6% % of segment revenue 74.4% 75.0% 75.3% Segment gross margin % 25.6% 25.0% 24.7% For the year ended December 31, 2022, our Clinical Solutions segment direct costs increased by $13.6 million, or 0.4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily driven by increased billable headcount to support revenue growth, partially offset by positive impacts from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, lower reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses related to COVID-19 projects, and our margin enhancement initiatives. Gross margins for our Clinical Solutions segment were 25.6% and 25.0% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Gross margin was higher during 2022 as compared to the prior year primarily due to lower reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses and positive impacts from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by increased billable headcount costs and contract labor. _Commercial Solutions_ Direct costs for our Commercial Solutions segment, excluding share-based compensation expense, were as follows (dollars in thousands): Direct costs $ 1,078,745 $ 947,309 $ 847,330 $ 131,436 13.9% $ 99,979 11.8% % of segment revenue 81.6% 79.3% 79.2% Segment gross margin % 18.4% 20.7% 20.8% For the year ended December 31, 2022, our Commercial Solutions segment direct costs increased by $ 131.4 million, or 13.9%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily driven by increased billable headcount to support revenue growth and higher reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses. Gross margins for our Commercial Solutions segment were 18.4% and 20.7% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Gross margin was lower during 2022 as compared to the prior year primarily due to a less favorable revenue mix, driven by new deployments of field teams and higher reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses. ----- Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 547,254 $ 570,765 $ 472,726 $ (23,511) (4.1)% $ 98,039 20.7% % of total revenue 10.1% 10.9% 10.7% Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to lower transaction, integration-related, and other expenses and positive impacts from our margin enhancement initiatives.

The increase in total other expense, net was primarily due to higher other expense, net in 2022 as compared to 2021, which primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses that result from exchange rate fluctuations on our monetary asset balances denominated in currencies other than our functional currency. Other expense (income), net also includes other gains and losses related to investments and contingent consideration related to divested businesses. The increase in interest expense in 2022 as compared to 2021 was primarily due to increased interest rates on variable rate debt. Due to higher variable interest rates, including the expiration of interest rate swaps in March 2023, we expect to experience higher interest expense in 2023. The loss on extinguishment of debt was $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. These losses were incurred primarily as a result of our debt prepayments and refinancing transactions.

The decrease was primarily due to lower cash-related net income, partially offset by positive changes in operating assets and liabilities relative to the prior year period. Fluctuations in accounts receivable, unbilled services (including contract assets), and deferred revenue occur on a regular basis as we perform services, achieve milestones or other billing criteria, send invoices to customers, and collect outstanding accounts receivable. This activity varies by individual customer and contract. We attempt to negotiate payment terms that provide for payment of services prior to or soon after the provision of services, but the levels of accounts receivable, unbilled services (including contract assets), and deferred revenue can vary significantly from period to period. _Cash Flows from Investing Activities_ For the year ended December 31, 2022, we used $105.6 million in cash for investing activities, which included $93.5 million for purchases of property and equipment. We continue to closely monitor our capital expenditures while making strategic investments in the development of our IT infrastructure to meet the needs of our workforce, enable efficiencies, reduce business continuity risks, and conform to changes in governing rules and regulations. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we used $340.3 million in cash for investing activities, which consisted of $278.9 million of payments related to recent acquisitions and $56.8 million for purchases of property and equipment. _Cash Flows from Financing Activities_ For the year ended December 31, 2022, we used $339.2 million in cash for financing activities, which consisted primarily of net payments of long-term debt, repurchases of common stock, and payments related to tax withholdings for share-based compensation. These payments were partially offset by proceeds from our accounts receivable financing arrangement and Existing Revolving Facility. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we used $277.6 million in cash for financing activities, which consisted primarily of net repayments of long-term debt and repurchases of our common stock.

See “Note 3 – Long-Term Debt Obligations” of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this offering circular for additional details regarding our long-term debt arrangements. Our long-term debt arrangements contain customary restrictive covenants and, as of June 30, 2023, we were in compliance with all applicable debt covenants. _Interest Rates_ In March 2023, we entered into interest rate swaps with multiple counterparties. The interest rate swaps had an initial aggregate notional value of $650.0 million, an effective date of March 31, 2023, and will expire on March 31, 2026. As of June 30, 2023, the notional value of these interest rate swaps was $650.0 million. Upon termination of the interest rate swaps in conjunction with the consummation of the Merger, we expect that we will remit or receive the difference between the fair value of the interest rate swaps and the replacement value in cash. We have entered into these interest rate swaps to mitigate our exposure to changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt. As of June 30, 2023, the percentage of our total principal debt (excluding finance leases) that is subject to fixed interest rates was approximately 47%.

1749_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.31,Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates,17.31.2,Revenue Recognition,"We adopted ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers and all the related amendments (“new revenue standard” or “ASC 606”) on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method for all contracts not completed as of the date of adoption. In accordance with ASC 606, revenue is recognized when, or as, a customer obtains control of promised services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for these services. The majority of our Clinical Solutions segment revenue is for service offerings that range in duration from a few months to several years and typically represent a single performance obligation. Revenue for these service contracts is recognized over time using an input measure of progress. The input measure reflects costs (including investigator payments and pass-through costs) incurred to date relative to total estimated costs to complete the contract (“cost-tocost measure of progress”). Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress methodology, revenue is recorded proportionally to costs incurred. Contract costs principally include direct labor, investigator payments, and passthrough costs. The estimate of total revenue and costs to completion requires significant judgment. Contract estimates are based on various assumptions to project future outcomes of events that often span several years, as well as on evaluations and updates made on an ongoing basis. These estimates are reviewed periodically and any adjustments are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period they become known. Updates and adjustments to estimates are likely to result in variability in revenue recognized from period to period and may cause unexpected variability in our operating results. In addition, in certain instances a customer contract may include forms of variable consideration such as incentive fees, volume rebates or other provisions that can increase or ----- decrease the transaction price. This variable consideration is generally awarded upon achievement of certain performance metrics, program milestones or cost targets. For the purposes of revenue recognition, variable consideration is assessed on a contract-by-contract basis and the amount to be recorded is estimated based on the assessment of our anticipated performance and consideration of all information that is reasonably available. Variable consideration is recognized as revenue if and when it is deemed probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved in the future. The largest of the service offerings within the Commercial Solutions segment relates to Deployment Solutions. Deployment Solutions contracts consist of services to promote and sell commercial products on behalf of a customer. The remaining Commercial Solutions contracts are generally short-term, month-to-month contracts or time and materials contracts. As such, Commercial Solutions revenue is generally recognized as services are performed for the amount we estimate we are entitled to for the period. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time based on the proportion of labor costs expended to total labor costs expected to complete the contract. Most of our contracts can be terminated by the customer without cause with a notice period that generally ranges from 30 to 90 days. In the event of termination, our contracts generally provide that the customer pay us for: (i) fees earned through the termination date; (ii) fees and expenses for winding down the project, which include both fees incurred and actual expenses; (iii) non-cancellable expenditures; and (iv) in some cases, a fee to cover a portion of the remaining professional fees on the project. Our long-term clinical trial contracts contain implied substantive termination penalties because of the significant wind-down cost of terminating a clinical trial. These provisions for termination penalties result in these types of contracts being treated as long-term for revenue recognition purposes. Changes in the scope of work are common, especially under long-term contracts, and generally result in a renegotiation of future contract pricing terms and change in contract transaction price. If the customer does not agree to a contract modification, we could bear the risk of cost overruns. Most of our contract modifications are for services that are not distinct from the services under the existing contract due to the significant integration service provided in the context of the contract and therefore result in a cumulative catch-up adjustment to revenue at the date of contract modification. _Timing of Billing and Performance_ Differences in the timing of revenue recognition and associated billings and cash collections result in recording of billed accounts receivable, unbilled accounts receivable, contract assets, and deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet. Amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms either at periodic intervals or upon achievement of contractual milestones. Billings generally occur subsequent to revenue recognition, resulting in recording of unbilled accounts receivable in instances where the right to bill is contingent solely on the passage of time (e.g., in the following month) and contract assets in instances where the right to bill is associated with a contingency (e.g., achievement of a milestone). Accounts receivable are recorded at net realizable value. Unbilled accounts receivable (including contract assets) arise when services have been rendered for which revenue has been recognized but the customers have not been billed. In general, prerequisites for billings and payments are established by contractual provisions, including predetermined payment schedules, which may or may not correspond to the timing of the performance of services under the contract. Contract assets include unbilled amounts typically resulting from revenue recognized in excess of the amounts billed to the customer for which the right to payment is subject to factors other than the passage of time. These amounts may not exceed their net realizable value. Contract assets are generally classified as current. Deferred revenue represents contract liabilities and consists of customer payments received in advance of performance and billings in excess of revenue recognized, net of revenue recognized from the balance at the beginning of the period. Contract assets and deferred revenue are presented on the balance sheet on a net contractby-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.",N/A,as_expected,2023,344
1749_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.31,Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates,17.31.3,Goodwill and Intangible Assets,"----- Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and more frequently if impairment indicators arise, which requires significant judgment. Impairment indicators include events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit with assigned goodwill below its carrying amount. We monitor events and changes in circumstances on a continuous basis between annual impairment testing dates to determine if any events or changes in circumstances indicate impairment. Separate intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives or over the period in which economic benefit is received. Our finite-lived intangibles consist of customer relationships, acquired backlog, trade names, trademarks, patient communities, and acquired technologies. All finite-lived intangibles, excluding acquired backlog, are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. Acquired backlog is amortized on an accelerated basis, which coincides with the period of economic benefit received by us. The goodwill impairment test involves comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit, including goodwill, to its carrying value using a qualitative or quantitative analysis. If the qualitative analysis indicates that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value for the reporting unit, we perform a quantitative analysis of the reporting unit. If based on the qualitative analysis it is more likely than not that the reporting unit’s estimated fair value exceeds its carrying value, no further analysis is required. If after performing the quantitative analysis it is more likely than not that the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, a non-cash goodwill impairment loss must be recognized in an amount equal to that excess for that reporting unit, not to exceed the total goodwill amount for that reporting unit. The fair value of a reporting unit could be negatively impacted by future events and circumstances. Such events or circumstances include a future decline in our results of operations, a decline in the valuation of biopharmaceutical company stocks, an increase in weighted-average cost of capital, a significant slowdown in the worldwide economy, failure to meet the performance projections included in our forecasts of future operating results, loss of key customers, and a reduction in R&D spending or outsourcing by biopharmaceutical companies, among other events and circumstances. When performing the quantitative analysis, we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using the income approach. This approach incorporates a discounted cash flow model in which the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit are discounted using a risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital. The forecasts used in the discounted cash flow model for each reporting unit are based in part on strategic plans and represent our estimates based on current and forecasted business and market conditions. The determination of fair value for each reporting unit requires significant judgments and estimates and actual results could be materially different than those judgments and estimates, which may result in a non-cash impairment charge. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we performed a quantitative analysis for our Communications reporting unit, which had a goodwill balance of $529.1 million as of December 31, 2022. We concluded that the estimated fair value of our Communications reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately $19.0 million, or 3%, and therefore no impairment existed. Although we believe that the current assumptions and estimates used in our goodwill analysis are reasonable, supportable, and appropriate, continued efforts to maintain or improve the performance of our businesses, including our Communications reporting unit, could be impacted by unfavorable or unforeseen changes that could impact the existing assumptions used in the impairment analysis. Various factors could reasonably be expected to unfavorably impact existing assumptions: primarily delays in awards and the related delay in revenue, increases in termination activity, continued deterioration of macroeconomic conditions, and increases in operating costs or weighted-average cost of capital. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for the purposes of the goodwill impairment analysis will prove to be accurate predictions of future performance.",N/A,as_expected,2023,344

Our subsidiaries in international jurisdictions file tax returns in their respective jurisdictions. We provide for income taxes on all transactions that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements. Specifically, we estimate our tax liability based on current tax laws in the statutory jurisdictions in which we ----- operate. Accordingly, the impact of changes in income tax laws on deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are recognized in net earnings in the period during which such changes are enacted. We record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for tax benefit carryforwards using enacted tax rates in effect in the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. We provide valuation allowances against deferred tax assets for amounts that are not considered more likely than not to be realized. The valuation of the deferred tax asset is dependent on, among other things, our ability to generate a sufficient level of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we have considered both positive and negative evidence, such as historical and forecasted results of operations, and have considered the implementation of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. If the objectively verifiable negative evidence outweighs any available positive evidence (or the only available positive is subjective and cannot be verified), then a valuation allowance will likely be deemed necessary. If a valuation allowance is deemed to be unnecessary, such allowance is released and any related benefit is recognized in the period of the change. We recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if we believe it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position. Judgment is required in determining what constitutes an individual tax position, as well as the assessment of the outcome of each tax position. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating tax positions and tax benefits. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in domestic and foreign jurisdictions. We evaluate uncertain tax positions pursuant to the more likely than not standard, and benefits related to such uncertain tax positions are recognized as the largest amount of benefit, determined on a cumulative probability basis, to be realized upon ultimate settlement of the position. If the calculation of the liability related to uncertain tax positions proves to be more or less than the ultimate settlement, a tax expense or benefit, respectively, would result. Unrecognized tax benefits are presented as either a reduction to a deferred tax asset or as a separate liability.",N/A,as_expected,2023,344

Deep Expertise and Differentiated Value Proposition Across Therapeutic Areas and Delivery Models._** We are differentiated by our significant experience, deep therapeutic knowledge, and ability to manage complex trials, ----- including in oncology and CNS, which are two of the largest and fastest growing therapeutic areas. Oncology is Syneos’ largest therapeutic area at 33% of clinical net revenue and is the highest growth therapeutic area for CRO spend, while CNS is one the fastest growing therapeutic areas due to increased investment from pharmaceutical R&D spend and biotech funding in the space. Oncology FSO net revenue has grown at a CAGR of approximately 24% from 2019 to 2022, while the overall market grew 10% during this same time period, with recent RFPs and awards suggesting that CNS is well-positioned to grow. Our net promotor scores (“NPS”) for both Oncology and CNS are ahead of or in-line with leading players. We also have a leading position in FSP and were an early entrant in the market. Our portfolio of services is integrated with many customers’ drug development processes. This allows us to be well positioned to provide customized FSP solutions to meet customers’ demands. Moreover, FSP delivery as a portion of the outsourcing market is growing, driven primarily by large pharmaceutical customers who want to maintain oversight and influence over their drug development pipeline while outsourcing key mission-critical services to CROs. From 2018 to 2021, FSP penetration of total outsourced clinical trial activities increased from 28% to 41%, representing approximately 13% growth per year. Over the past three years our FSP business has grown from $344 million of net revenue in 2019 to $522 million in 2022, representing a 15% CAGR from 2019 to 2022.",N/A,as_expected,2023,344

EBITDA Margin vs. Peers,17.41.1,Performance Turnaround Driven by Initiatives that Support Continued Growth. We have made significant progress,"in undertaking a number of high-impact initiatives that have already resulted in improved business performance and are expected to lead to continued growth. Following an approximate 40% growth in bookings from 2019 to 2022 as a result of our leadership in growing segments of the market, our Clinical Solutions business experienced a decline in performance in the second half of 2022 driven by industry-high turnover and a lack of sufficient investment in our administrative systems after years of rapid growth. We have since made significant progress to address the performance challenges the company experienced in 2022. Across the industry, employee attrition increased through 2020 and 2021 due to a combination of the “Great Resignation” (the ongoing economic trend where employees voluntarily resigned from their jobs in mass in early 2021, sparked by the COVID pandemic) and cross-competitor recruiting of talent. Syneos experienced above-market attrition, driven by high utilization, underinvested administrative systems and operational volatility, with an approximate 95% increase in trailing 6-month voluntary attrition from June 2020 to September 2021. Over the last 18 months we have worked to improve employee engagement and reduce turnover by increasing wages to be in-line with or above market, centralizing resource management, and focusing on employee satisfaction. As a result, employee attrition has consistently trended down and has normalized to pre-2020 levels. To improve our underinvested administrative systems we initiated targeted upgrades of critical operational and backoffice systems, which are already improving workflow, and also took steps to improve customer-facing technology. This has resulted in recent quarterly results showing indications of significant progress, two indicators of which are FSA to target and LPI to target. FSA are new projects where we had the first trial active prior to the target start date, and LPI are projects where we met the target date for completion of the last patient in the trial. Both metrics represent our ability to deliver on customers’ required timelines and are an important purchasing factor for pharmaceutical companies when choosing a CRO. In the quarter ended June 30, 2023, our FSA and LPI to target metrics hit their highest levels since 2021, with FSA to target improving by approximately 45% from its trough in the first half of 2022 and LPI to target improving by approximately 50% since the second half of 2021 which, amongst other key performance indicators, is an indication of the improvements made in our delivery model. We have also streamlined operations by reducing business unit siloing, encouraging cross-team collaboration, and dedicating significant resources to address customer delivery challenges. These actions have also resulted in a projectcentric delivery model focused on operational discipline, appropriate staffing, and trial performance, and have resulted in improved performance scorecards and new awards. As a result of our recent operational initiatives, we have seen a consistent improvement in RFP flow and book-to-bill after a trough in the quarter ended September 30, 2022. Clinical Solutions RFP flow was up approximately 26% in the quarter ended June 30, 2023 compared to the trough in the quarter ended September 30, 2022. This increase was driven by strong performance across both Top 50 and SMID customers. Clinical Solutions book-to-bill has also increased significantly compared to the trough in the quarter ended September 30, 2022, growing for three consecutive quarters and reaching 0.9x in the quarter ended June 30, 2023. Both RFP flow and awards represent leading indicators for future revenue growth.",N/A,as_expected,2023,344

In addition to recruiting investigational sites and ultimately patients and managing clinical trial sites, CROs provide a variety of services to ensure that trial runs efficiently. They provide project and data management, research and regulatory compliance services, research education, and medical writing, in addition to other services. CROs play a pivotal role in the pharmaceutical and drug development process, improving speed and certainty of trial outcomes while providing critical services that assist in the navigation of complex regulatory environments. CCOs offer a wide array of commercialization services to their customers, typically related to preparing new products for launch and maximizing sales. Typically, CCOs operate across medical affairs, marketing, market access, and other commercialization services. Medical affairs teams focus on target customer analysis to find key stakeholders who they can leverage to make a successful brand. Market access is the practice of making the drug available to patients, covering the full range from pricing strategy to reimbursement.

1749_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.47,Government Regulation,17.47.1,,"The biopharmaceutical industry is subject to a high degree of governmental regulation in both domestic and international markets. Regardless of the country or region in which approval is being sought, before a marketing ----- application for a drug is ready for submission to regulatory authorities, the candidate drug must undergo rigorous testing in pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. The clinical trial process must be conducted in accordance with the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act in the U.S. and similar laws and regulations in the relevant foreign jurisdictions (e.g., the European Union Clinical Trials Regulation). These laws and regulations require the candidate drug to be tested and studied in certain ways prior to submission for approval. _Regulation of Our Clinical Solutions Segment_ In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) regulates the conduct of clinical trials of drug products in human subjects, and the form and content of regulatory applications. The FDA also regulates the development, approval, manufacture, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping, import, export, distribution, advertising, sale, and marketing of drug products. The FDA has similar authority and similar requirements with respect to the clinical testing of biological products and medical devices. In the European Union (“EU”) and other jurisdictions where our customers intend to apply for marketing authorization (of drug products) or seek certification (of medical devices), similar laws and regulations apply. Within the EU, these requirements are enforced by the EMA and competent authorities of the EU member states. Additional national requirements may vary slightly from one member state to another. In Canada, clinical trials are regulated by the Health Products Food Branch of Health Canada as well as provincial regulations. Similar requirements also apply in other jurisdictions, including Australia, Japan, and other Asia-Pacific countries, where we operate or where our customers intend to apply for marketing authorization. Sponsors of clinical trials also follow the International Council on Harmonisation (“ICH”) guidelines on Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”), which are enforced by the FDA and other comparable regulatory authorities, and may be amended from time to time. Our services are subject to various regulatory requirements designed to ensure the quality and integrity of the clinical trial process. In the U.S., we must perform our clinical development services in compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations, including GCP and Good Pharmacovigilance Practice, which govern, among other things, the design, conduct, performance, monitoring, auditing, recording, analysis, and reporting of clinical trials. Before a human clinical trial may begin, the manufacturer or sponsor of the investigational drug or biologic must file an investigational new drug application (“IND”) with the FDA, which contains, among other things, the results of pre-clinical tests, manufacturing information, and other analytical data. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during asset development. Each clinical trial conducted in the U.S. must be conducted pursuant to, and in accordance with, an effective IND. In addition, under GCP regulations, each human clinical trial we conduct is subject to the oversight of an independent institutional review board (“IRB”) which is an independent committee that has the regulatory authority to review, approve and monitor a clinical trial. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the study subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical trials conducted outside the U.S. are subject to the laws and regulations of the country where the trials are conducted. These laws and regulations might not be similar to the laws and regulations administered by the FDA and other laws and regulations regarding the protection of patient safety and privacy and the control of study pharmaceuticals, medical devices or other study materials. Studies conducted outside the U.S. can also be subject to regulation by the FDA if the studies are conducted pursuant to an IND, or in the case of a medical device, an investigational device exemption. It is the responsibility of the study sponsor or the parties conducting the studies to ensure that all applicable legal and regulatory requirements are fulfilled. To comply with GCP and other regulations, we must, among other things: - comply with specific requirements governing the selection of qualified principal investigators and clinical research sites; - obtain specific written commitments from principal investigators; - obtain review, approval, and supervision of the clinical trials by an IRB or ethics committee; - obtain favorable opinion from regulatory agencies to commence a clinical trial; ----- - verify that appropriate patient informed consents are obtained before the patient participates in a clinical trial; - ensure that adverse drug reactions resulting from the administration of a drug or biologic during a clinical trial are medically evaluated and reported in a timely manner; - monitor the validity and accuracy of data; - monitor drug, biologic or device accountability at clinical research sites; and - verify that principal investigators and study staff maintain records and reports and permit appropriate governmental authorities access to data for review. Similar regulations and guidelines exist in various states and in other countries. In the EU, similarly to the U.S., the various phases of non-clinical and clinical research are subject to significant regulatory controls. Clinical trials of medicinal products (drugs, biologics, and medical devices) that support or are intended to support applications for research or marketing authorization must be conducted in accordance with applicable EU and national regulations and the ICH guidelines on GCP, which are ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. If the sponsor of a clinical trial is not established within the EU, it must appoint an EU entity to act as its legal representative for clinical trials conducted in the EU. Non-clinical studies must be conducted in accordance with the principles of good laboratory practice (“GLP”) as set forth in EU Directive 2004/10/EC. Non-clinical studies are performed to demonstrate the health or environmental safety of new chemical or biological substances. In particular, non-clinical studies, both in vitro and in vivo, must be planned, performed, monitored, recorded, reported, and archived in accordance with the GLP principles, which define a set of rules and criteria for a quality system for the organizational process and the conditions for non-clinical studies. These GLP standards reflect the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development requirements. The regulatory landscape related to clinical trials in the EU has been subject to recent changes. The EU Clinical Trials Regulation (“CTR”), which was adopted in April 2014 and repeals the EU Clinical Trials Directive, became applicable on January 31, 2022. Unlike directives, the CTR is directly applicable in all EU member states, as well as Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland, without the need for member states to further implement it into national law. The CTR notably harmonizes the assessment and supervision processes for clinical trials throughout the EU via a Clinical Trials Information System, which contains a centralized EU portal and database. The UK left the EU on January 31, 2020, following which existing EU medicinal product legislation continued to apply in the UK during the transition period under the terms of the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement. As of January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”) is the UK’s standalone medicines and medical devices regulator. EU laws that have been transposed into UK law through secondary legislation continue to be applicable as “retained EU law.” However, new legislation such as the EU CTR is not applicable. The UK government has passed a new Medicines and Medical Devices Act 2021, which introduces delegated powers in favor of the Secretary of State or an ‘appropriate authority’ to amend or supplement existing regulations in the area of medicinal products and medical devices. This allows new rules to be introduced in the future by way of secondary legislation, which aims to allow flexibility in addressing regulatory gaps and future changes in the fields of human medicines, clinical trials, and medical devices. We may be subject to regulatory action if we fail to comply with applicable rules and regulations. Failure to comply with certain regulations can also result in the termination of ongoing research and disqualification of data collected during the clinical trials. For example, violations of GCP could result, depending on the nature of the violation and the type of product involved, in the issuance of a warning letter, suspension or termination of a clinical study, refusal of the FDA or other comparable regulatory authorities to approve clinical trial or marketing applications or withdrawal of such applications, injunction, seizure of investigational products, civil penalties, criminal prosecutions, or debarment from assisting in the submission of new drug applications. See “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business – If we fail to perform our services in accordance with contractual requirements, regulatory requirements, and ethical considerations, we could be subject to significant costs, liability, or regulatory enforcement actions, and our reputation could be harmed.” ----- We monitor our clinical trials to test for compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We have adopted standard operating procedures that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements and serve as a mechanism for controlling and enhancing the quality of our clinical trials. In the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions where we operate, our procedures were developed to ensure compliance with GCP and associated guidelines. In addition to its comprehensive regulation of safety in the workplace, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for healthcare employers whose workers might be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and the hepatitis virus. Furthermore, certain employees might have to receive initial and periodic training to ensure compliance with applicable hazardous materials regulations and health and safety guidelines. We are subject to similar regulations in Canada and Spain. _Regulation of Our Commercial Solutions Segment_ The safety of medicines continues to be monitored after drug product approvals and throughout their use in healthcare practice. Post-marketing safety surveillance is therefore also subject to FDA regulations as well as the EU pharmacovigilance legislation and other countries’ regulations. In addition, our field personnel are subject to all laws, rules and regulations governing the promotion of pharmaceutical products in the U.S. and in every other country where such personnel perform work. In particular, these rules and regulations include limitations on the indications for which a product may be promoted and on promotional spending. Additionally, these laws, rules and regulations govern the manner in which the product may be promoted, and the scientific exchange of information related to the product. Violations of these rules may leave us at risk of direct regulatory enforcement action and/or cause us to be in breach of contract with our customers. Some of our field personnel handle and distribute samples of pharmaceutical products. In the U.S., the handling and distribution of prescription drug product samples are subject to regulation under the Prescription Drug Marketing Act and other applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations and other countries may have similar laws or regulations. These laws and regulations regulate the distribution of drug samples by mandating procedures for storage and record-keeping requirements for drug samples and ban the purchase or sale of drug samples. Further, we must comply with the requirements of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, which regulates the distribution, record-keeping, handling, security, and disposal of controlled substances. Our communications offerings are subject to all regulatory risks applicable to similar communications businesses as well as risks that relate specifically to the provision of these services to the biopharmaceutical industry. Such regulatory risks include enforcement by the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S., Health Canada, the Department of Health in the UK, competent authorities of the EU member states, as well as state agencies and other foreign regulators enforcing laws relating to product advertising, false advertising, and unfair and deceptive trade practices. In addition to enforcement actions initiated by government agencies, there has been an increasing tendency in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions among biopharmaceutical companies to resort to the courts and industry and self-regulatory bodies to challenge comparative prescription drug advertising on the grounds that the advertising is false and deceptive. There continues to be an expansion of specific rules, prohibitions, media restrictions, labeling disclosures, and warning requirements with respect to the advertising for certain products. _Data Protection Regulation_ We are subject to data protection laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate that address the privacy, security, and other processing of personal information. These laws and regulations govern the collection, use, handling, and disclosure of health-related and other personal information and require that we adopt and maintain reasonable and appropriate security measures that are designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the information. These laws and regulations also typically require the adoption and maintenance of procedures that facilitate the exercise of an individual’s rights with respect to the information about them. Certain of these laws may also contain requirements relating to the location of the personal information, or the transfer of personal information from one country or region to other countries.

Of these, 28,487 employees were regular and 710 were temporary. An additional 374 contingent workers provided services for us. _Our Culture and Values. Our culture remains the cornerstone of all our human capital programs. Our shared_ purpose, Shortening the distance from lab to life[®], aligns our employees and the customers we serve. This environment is fueled by a belief in caring for our collective well-being, which we refer to as Total Self. This belief enables employees to be their authentic selves at work, fostering a diverse, equitable, and inclusive culture where employees are empowered. _Safety and Health. The safety, health, and welfare of our employees are paramount to us. Our global Health and_ Safety team, with regional and operational expertise, provides for the health and safety of our employees, regardless of where they work or what they do. To support our Health and Safety professionals, we have selected and are implementing a software toolset to support our health and safety efforts. This newly organized team and new toolsets will enable our Health and Safety program to be metrics based with targeted improvements, both as the regulatory environment changes and year over year. We have also activated our Business Continuity and Crisis Response team to help cultivate the safety of our employees in conflict zones across the world, particularly in Ukraine. This team began its work in December of 2021 and was fully prepared to offer employees support in an effort to promote safety for themselves and their families. These efforts include financial and relocation assistance, alternative working arrangements, information sharing from our intelligence partners (such as near real time border crossing wait times and procedures), and direct access to the Business Continuity and Crisis Response team to ensure employees’ needs are met to the best of our ability. We continue to provide this support to ensure our employees have the highest level of care that we can provide as an organization. _Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (“DE&I”). We strive to lead our industry in our DE&I efforts both internally and_ externally. We believe that addressing complex healthcare challenges requires contributions from diverse viewpoints and an inclusive, equitable space where our employees can achieve their highest potential. We strive to foster a work environment that includes and embraces racial, ethnic, and gender diversity and other individual differences. Our policies prohibit unlawful discrimination based on race, color, creed, gender, religion, marital status, age, national origin or ancestry, genetic information, physical or mental disability, medical condition, sexual ----- orientation, gender expression or identity, or any other characteristic protected by applicable law. The emphasis placed on DE&I by us and by our Board of Directors (“Board”) is demonstrated by the inclusion of DE&I updates and metrics in the materials for each regular meeting of the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board. In 2022, we also created an internal Diversity Action Collab, a peer-to-peer knowledgesharing forum led by the Chief Scientific Officer, and an external DE&I Advisory Council where we provide our customers with actionable insights and top-tier expertise to navigate complex regulatory guidelines and mandates, and achieve corporate, healthcare, and other business initiatives. As of June 30, 2023, 68% of our total workforce, 64% of our global new hires, and 57% of our global management roles at the Director level and above identify as women. As of June 30, 2023, 34% of our U.S. workforce, 38% of our U.S. new hires, and 22% of our U.S. management roles at the Director level and above identified as part of a traditionally underrepresented racial or ethnic group. Our DE&I strategy is managed by our DE&I Council, which oversees and strategically plans for diversity and inclusion within our organization under three pillars of focus: People, Customer, and Community. Throughout 2022, we grew our existing Employee Resource Group (“ERG”) ecosystem across the globe to eight ERGs and one business community: Asian, Black, ConeXion (for our LatinX community), Developing Professionals (for both early and progressing talent), LGBTQIA+, Persons with Disabilities, Women, Veterans, and RISE (Realizing Inclusivity & Success through Inclusivity) within our commercial business. These ERGs further honor our equitable and inclusive Total Self environment by building, supporting, and creating visibility and engagement opportunities for our internal communities. We maintain a zero-tolerance policy on discrimination and harassment and have several programs under which employees can report incidents in good faith confidentially or anonymously, and without fear of reprisal. _Recruitment, Retention and Development. The primary ways we recruit and retain employees are by (1) providing_ compensation and benefits that are competitive in our industry and in local labor markets, (2) designing our leadership and development programs to support our culture and values while preparing our people for the future, and (3) maintaining an effective service delivery model conducive to work-life balance and employee needs. Our Global Talent Acquisition team leverages numerous resources including industry networks, online and social media platforms, university relations, and industry-focused career events to source talent for open positions. Candidates are thoroughly screened and evaluated against job-specific skills, experience, and education criteria. We continuously work at improving our candidate experience, which has been recognized seven times with a North American Candidate Experience Award, awarded by the Talent Board for excellence in Talent Acquisition. In 2021, we introduced our Enabling our Talent Advantage (“ETA”) program that concentrates on increased demand for clinical resources with an ultimate focus on our talent acquisition and retention strategies. In 2022, the ETA program has resulted in a new agile talent acquisition operating model, identified opportunities for automation that elevate candidate and hiring manager experiences, and developed external talent community strategies that deliver real-time talent pools for critical in-demand skill sets. In addition, the ETA program has improved our internal mobility policy, developing feeder pools for key roles in support of our early talent strategy and developing a line manager curriculum to better and more simply equip managers to support our workforce. As an operational example of the ETA program’s impact, in the first six months of 2022, we successfully recruited, hired, and integrated approximately 500 entry level CRA’s, dramatically expanding our site monitoring capabilities and preparedness. We offer extensive, award-winning training programs that provide regulatory, business, foreign language, leadership, and management training and other opportunities for professional and personal development. As part of our empowered employee experience, we offer a suite of tools to assist employees to own their careers and aim to reach their highest professional potential. As an organization with services spanning clinical and commercial as well as numerous corporate functions, we encourage and enable internal mobility to support retention. We regularly evaluate our compensation and benefit programs using external market data and feedback from our Global Talent Acquisition team and have established processes to make necessary revisions. Our Total Rewards ----- team introduced a new global salary structure to drive consistent enterprise-wide compensation and job level practices, ensuring our compensation remains competitive in the many countries in which our employees reside. _Listening to our Employees. We are an agile and continuous learning organization, listening to employees at all_ levels – particularly at key moments that matter – and harvesting actionable insights to shape the employee experience. A key element of our listening strategy includes purposeful pulse surveys designed to check on key audiences at key moments. Overall, our listening includes our employee engagement survey and regular employee lifecycle surveys, including onboarding (following the first week and at 90 days of employment) and exit surveys. Ultimately, we leverage these insights to inform and improve our employee programs and services.",N/A,as_expected,2023,344

Unless the Merger will be consummated on the Issue Date, on the Issue Date, the Company will enter into an escrow agreement (as amended, supplemented or modified from time to time, the “Escrow Agreement”) among the Company, the Trustee and Citibank, N.A., a national banking association organized and existing under the laws of the United ----- States, acting through its Agency & Trust business not in its individual capacity but solely as escrow agent (in such capacity, together with its successors, the “Escrow Agent”), pursuant to which an amount equal to the gross proceeds of the offering of the Secured Notes sold on the Issue Date will be deposited into an escrow account (the “Escrow _Account”). By its acceptance of the Secured Notes, each Holder shall be deemed to authorize and direct the Trustee_ to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Account will not include cash to fund any accrued and unpaid interest owing to Holders of the Secured Notes, which is included in the Special Mandatory Redemption Price (as defined below). In the event that the Special Mandatory Redemption Price payable upon a Special Mandatory Redemption (as defined below) for the Secured Notes exceeds the amount of the Escrowed Property (as defined below), the Sponsors (directly or through one or more of their respective Affiliates) will be required to fund the difference between the applicable Special Mandatory Redemption Price and the amount of the Escrowed Property, plus the fees and expenses of the Trustee, the Notes Collateral Agent and the Escrow Agent, pursuant to a commitment provided by them. The initial funds deposited in the Escrow Account, and all other funds, securities, interest, dividends, distributions, earnings and other property and payments credited to the Escrow Account in connection with the Secured Notes (less any property and/or funds paid in accordance with the Escrow Agreement), are referred to, collectively, as the “Escrowed Property.” The Escrowed Property will be controlled by the Escrow Agent on behalf of the Trustee and the Holders of the Secured Notes. Interest will be calculated in accordance with the terms of the Secured Indenture and the Secured Notes. Other than in connection with the payment of a semi-annual interest payment as set forth under “—Principal, Maturity and Interest,” the Company will only be entitled to cause the Escrow Agent to release the Escrowed Property (in which case the Escrowed Property will be paid to, or as directed by, the Company) (the “Escrow _Release”) upon delivery to the Escrow Agent, on or prior to November 17, 2023 (the “Escrow Outside Date”), of an_ Officer’s Certificate (the “Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate”), upon which the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely absolutely without further investigation, to the effect that: (1) the Merger will be consummated substantially concurrently with or promptly following the Escrow Release; (2) the First Lien Credit Agreement has become effective or will become effective substantially concurrently with or promptly following the Escrow Release; and (3) (A) the Subsidiary Guarantors have become, or will become substantially concurrently with or promptly following the Escrow Release, by supplemental indenture, parties to the Secured Indenture and (B) the Subsidiary Guarantors have executed, or will execute substantially concurrently with or promptly following the Escrow Release, the Notes Collateral Documents. The Escrow Release will occur promptly following the receipt by the Escrow Agent of the Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate (the date of the Escrow Release (which shall also be the date that the Merger is consummated), the “Completion Date”). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the Merger has been consummated substantially concurrently with the consummation of the offering of the Secured Notes, the “Completion Date” shall mean the Issue Date. Upon the Escrow Release, the Escrowed Property will be paid out of the Escrow Account in accordance with the Escrow Agreement and the Escrow Account will be reduced to zero. The Company will grant the Trustee, for its benefit and the benefit of the Notes Collateral Agent and the Holders, subject to certain liens of the Escrow Agent, a first-priority security interest in the Escrow Account to secure the payment of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price of the Secured Notes; provided, however, that such liens and security interest shall automatically be released and terminate at such time as the Escrowed Property is released from the Escrow Account on the Completion Date. For the avoidance of doubt, such liens and security interest will be permitted under the Secured Indenture. The Escrow Agent will invest the Escrowed Property as ----- directed by the Company in such short-term liquid investments (including bank deposit products) as permitted under the Escrow Agreement, and liquidate such investments as the Company will from time to time direct in writing. In the absence of a written investment direction, the Escrowed Property will remain invested in cash. In the event that (i) the Escrow Outside Date occurs and the Escrow Agent shall not have received the Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate on or prior to such date, (ii) the Company informs the Escrow Agent in writing that, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, the Merger will not be consummated on or prior to the Escrow Outside Date or (iii) the Company informs the Escrow Agent in writing that the Merger Agreement was terminated prior to the Escrow Outside Date (the date of any such event being the “Special Termination Date”), the Company will redeem the Secured Notes (the “Special Mandatory Redemption”) at a price (the “Special Mandatory Redemption _Price”) equal to 100% of the initial issue price of the Secured Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Secured_ Notes, if any, from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from the Issue Date to, but excluding, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below).

On or prior to the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Trustee for payment to each Holder of Secured Notes the applicable Special Mandatory Redemption Price for such Holder’s Secured Notes and the fees and expenses of the Trustee, the Notes Collateral Agent and the Escrow Agent and, concurrently with such payments, deliver any excess Escrowed Property (if any) to the Company.

Each Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable law as a fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or unjust preference, including provisions of the Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law or provincial law to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Secured Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note Guarantee. See “Risk Factors— Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws may permit a court to void the Notes or the related guarantees and any related security, and if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the Notes.” The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon: (1) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (including by way of merger, amalgamation, consolidation, dividend, distribution or otherwise) of all of the Capital Stock of such Guarantor or the sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Guarantor, in either case to a Person other than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary and as otherwise not prohibited by the Secured Indenture; (2) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, the designation in accordance with the Secured Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or the occurrence of any event after which the Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary; (3) defeasance or discharge of the Secured Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”; (4) such Guarantor being (or being substantially concurrently) released or discharged from all of (i) its obligations under all of its Guarantees of payment by the Company of any Indebtedness of the Company under the First Lien Credit Agreement or (ii) in the case of a Note Guarantee made by a Guarantor as a result of its guarantee of other Indebtedness of the Company or a Guarantor pursuant to the covenant entitled “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees,” by the Company or the applicable Guarantor of the relevant Indebtedness, except in the case of clause (i) or (ii), a release as a result of payment under such Guarantee (it being understood that a release subject to a contingent reinstatement is still considered a release); (5) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, upon the merger, amalgamation or consolidation of any Guarantor with and into the Company or another Guarantor or upon the liquidation of such Guarantor, in each case, in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Secured Indenture; (6) upon the achievement of Investment Grade Status by the Secured Notes; provided that such Note Guarantee shall be reinstated upon the Reversion Date; and ----- (7) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers.” Claims of creditors of Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those Subsidiaries and claims against joint ventures generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries and joint ventures over the claims of creditors of the Company, including Holders of the Secured Notes. The Secured Notes and each Note Guarantee therefor will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries of the Company (other than the Guarantors) and joint ventures. Although the Secured Indenture limits the incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Secured Indenture does not impose any limitation on the incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Secured Indenture.

Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, only the Controlling Collateral Agent (or any Person authorized by it) may act with respect to any Shared Collateral (including with respect to any intercreditor agreement with respect to any Shared Collateral). The Controlling Collateral Agent will initially be the First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent and will remain the First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent until the earlier of (1) the Discharge of First Lien Credit Agreement Obligations and (2) the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date (such earlier date, the “Controlling Collateral Agent Change Date”). After the Controlling Collateral Agent Change Date, the Controlling Collateral Agent will be the Collateral Agent for the Controlling Secured Parties (acting on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative). The “Controlling Secured Parties” means, with respect to any Shared Collateral, (i) at any time when the First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent is the Controlling Collateral Agent with respect to such Shared Collateral, the First Lien Credit Agreement Secured Parties and (ii) at any other time, the Series of First Lien Secured Parties whose Authorized Representative is the Applicable Authorized Representative for such Shared Collateral. The “Applicable Authorized Representative” means with respect to any Shared Collateral, (i) until the Controlling Collateral Agent Change Date, the First Lien Credit Agreement Administrative Agent and (ii) from and after the Controlling Collateral Agent Change Date, the entity that was, prior to such Controlling Collateral Agent Change Date, the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative. ----- The “Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative” means, with respect to any Shared Collateral, the Authorized Representative of the Series of First Lien Obligations that constitutes the largest outstanding principal amount of any then outstanding Series of First Lien Obligations (including the First Lien Credit Agreement Obligations) with respect to such Shared Collateral, other than the Series of First Lien Obligations with respect to which the Authorized Representative is the Applicable Authorized Representative; provided, that if there are two outstanding Series of Additional First Lien Obligations with equal outstanding principal amounts, the Series of Additional First Lien Obligations with the earlier maturity date shall be considered to have a larger outstanding principal amount for purposes of this definition. With respect to any Shared Collateral, no Non-Controlling Authorized Representative or other NonControlling Secured Party shall commence any judicial or non-judicial foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or over, attempt any action to take possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise take any action to enforce its security interest in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of, any Shared Collateral (including with respect to any intercreditor agreement with respect to any Shared Collateral), whether under any First Lien Document, applicable law or otherwise. The “Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date” means, with respect to any NonControlling Authorized Representative, the date which is 180 days (throughout which 180-day period such NonControlling Authorized Representative was the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative) after the occurrence of both (a) an “event of default” with respect to the applicable Additional First Lien Obligations under which such Non-Controlling Authorized Representative is the Authorized Representative) and (b) each Collateral Agent’s and each other Authorized Representative’s receipt of written notice from such Non-Controlling Authorized Representative certifying that (i) such Non-Controlling Authorized Representative is the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative and that an “event of default” with respect to its Additional First Lien Obligations has occurred and is continuing and (ii) the Additional First Lien Obligations of the Series with respect to which such Non-Controlling Authorized Representative is the Authorized Representative are currently due and payable in full (whether as a result of acceleration thereof or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of the applicable First Lien Documents; provided, that the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date shall be stayed and shall not occur and shall be deemed not to have occurred with respect to any Shared Collateral (A) at any time the Applicable Authorized Representative or the Controlling Collateral Agent has commenced and is diligently pursuing any enforcement action with respect to such Shared Collateral or any material portion thereof or (B) at any time the Company, Parent or any other Guarantor which has granted a security interest in any such Shared Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding. If the NonControlling Authorized Representative or any other Non-Controlling Secured Party exercises any rights or remedies with respect to the Shared Collateral in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence of this paragraph and thereafter the Controlling Collateral Agent or any other Controlling Secured Party commences (or attempts to commence) the exercise of any of its rights or remedies with respect to the Shared Collateral (including seeking relief from the automatic stay or any other stay in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding), the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date shall be deemed not to have occurred and the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative or any other Non-Controlling Secured Party shall stop exercising any such rights or remedies with respect to the Shared Collateral. Only the Controlling Agent may act or refrain from acting with respect to the Shared Collateral. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, any Collateral Agent, any Authorized Representative, or any First Lien Secured Party may file a proof of claim or statement of interest with respect to the Obligations owed to such holder; (ii) any Collateral Agent, any Authorized Representative, or any First Lien Secured Party may (but shall not be obligated to) take any action to preserve or protect the validity and enforceability of the Liens granted in favor of such parties, provided that no such action is, or could reasonably be expected to be, (A) adverse, in any material respect, to the Liens granted in favor of the secured parties that are represented by the Controlling Collateral Agent or the rights of the Controlling Collateral Agent or any the secured parties represented thereby to exercise remedies in respect thereof or (B) otherwise inconsistent with the terms of the First Lien Agreement; and (iii) any Collateral Agent, any Authorized Representative, or any First Lien Secured Party may file any responsive or defensive pleadings in opposition to any motion, claim, adversary proceeding or other pleading made by any Person objecting to or otherwise seeking the disallowance of the claims or Liens of such ----- party, including any claims secured by the Collateral, in each case, to the extent not inconsistent with the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens with respect to any Shared Collateral, the Controlling Collateral Agent (acting on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative) may deal with such Shared Collateral as if the Controlling Collateral Agent had a senior Lien on such Collateral, subject to the waterfall provisions below. No Non-Controlling Collateral Agent or Non-Controlling Secured Party will contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the Controlling Collateral Agent, the Applicable Authorized Representative or any Controlling Secured Party or any other exercise by the Controlling Collateral Agent, the Applicable Authorized Representative or any Controlling Secured Party of any rights and remedies relating to the Shared Collateral, or to cause the Controlling Collateral Agent to do so. Each of the First Lien Secured Parties also will agree that it will not (and will waive any right to) challenge, question or contest or support any other Person in challenging, questions or contesting, in any proceeding (including any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding), the validity, value or enforceability of any First Lien Obligations of any Series or any security documents constituting First Lien Documents or the perfection, priority, validity, value, attachment or enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf of any of the First Lien Secured Parties in all or any part of the Collateral. No NonControlling Collateral Agent or Non-Controlling Secured Party will seek, and hereby waives any right, to have any Shared Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition of such Collateral. If an event of default with respect to any Series of First Lien Obligations has occurred and is continuing, and the Controlling Collateral Agent, the Applicable Authorized Representative or any First Lien Secured Party is taking action to enforce rights in respect of any Shared Collateral, or any distribution is made in respect of any Shared Collateral in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding (including any adequate protection payments) of the Company, Parent or any other Guarantor or any First Lien Secured Party receives any payment pursuant to any intercreditor agreement (other than the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) with respect to any Shared Collateral, the proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Shared Collateral by the Controlling Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party on account of such enforcement of rights or remedies or distribution in respect thereof in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding or any payment received by the Controlling Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party pursuant to any such intercreditor agreement (other than the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) with respect to such Shared Collateral (subject, in the case of any such payment, proceeds, or distribution, to the sentence immediately following) (all proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any Shared Collateral and all such payments, distributions, and proceeds of any such payment or distribution being collectively referred to as “Proceeds”) shall be applied: (i) first, to the payment in full in cash of all amounts owing to each Collateral Agent (in its capacity as such) pursuant to the terms of any applicable First Lien Document, (ii) second, subject to the provisions below applicable to Impairment, to the payment in full in cash of the First Lien Obligations of each Series secured by a valid and perfected Lien on such Shared Collateral on a ratable basis, with such Proceeds to be applied to the First Lien Obligations of a given Series in accordance with the terms of the applicable First Lien Documents; provided, that, following the commencement of any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding with respect to the Company, Parent or any other Guarantor, solely for the purpose of this paragraph, in the event that the value of the Shared Collateral is not sufficient for the entire amount of Post-Petition Interest on the First Lien Obligations to be allowed under Section 506(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other Bankruptcy Law in such Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, the amount of First Lien Obligations of each Series of First Lien Obligations shall include only the maximum amount of Post-Petition Interest allowable under Section 506(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other Bankruptcy Law in such Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding; and (iii) third, after payment in full of all First Lien Obligations, to the Company and the Guarantors or their successors or assigns, as their interests may appear, or to whomsoever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct. If, despite the provisions of above, any First Lien Secured Party shall receive any payment or other recovery in excess of its portion of payments on account of the First Lien Obligations to which it is then entitled in ----- accordance with the waterfall provisions above, such First Lien Secured Party shall hold such payment or recovery in trust for the benefit of all First Lien Secured Parties for distribution in accordance with the waterfall provisions above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Shared Collateral for which a third party (other than a First Lien Secured Party) has a lien or security interest that is junior in priority to the security interest of any Series of First Lien Obligations, but senior (as determined by appropriate legal proceedings in the case of any dispute) to the security interest of any other Series of First Lien Obligations (such third party, an “Intervening Creditor”), the value of any Shared Collateral or Proceeds allocated to such Intervening Creditor shall be deducted on a ratable basis solely from the Shared Collateral or Proceeds to be distributed in respect of the Series of First Lien Obligations with respect to which such Impairment exists. The holders of First Lien Obligations of any Series (and not the First Lien Secured Parties of any other Series) shall bear the risk of (a) any determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that (i) any of the First Lien Obligations of such Series are unenforceable under applicable law or are subordinated to any other obligations (other than another Series of First Lien Obligations), (ii) any of the First Lien Obligations of such Series do not have a valid and perfected security interest in any of the Collateral securing any other Series of First Lien Obligations and/or (iii) any intervening security interest exists securing any other obligations (other than another Series of First Lien Obligations) on a basis ranking prior to the security interest of such Series of First Lien Obligations but junior to the security interest of any other Series of First Lien Obligations or (b) the existence of any Collateral for any other Series of First Lien Obligations that is not Shared Collateral for such Series (any such condition referred to in the foregoing clauses (a) or (b) with respect to any Series of First Lien Obligations, an “Impairment” of such Series); _provided, that the existence of a maximum claim with respect to any real property subject to a mortgage that applies_ to all First Lien Obligations shall not be deemed to be an Impairment of any Series of First Lien Obligations. In the event of any Impairment with respect to any Series of First Lien Obligations, the results of such Impairment shall be borne solely by the holders of such Series of First Lien Obligations, and the rights of the holders of such Series of First Lien Obligations (including, without limitation, the right to receive distributions in respect of such Series of First Lien Obligations pursuant to the waterfall provisions above) shall be modified to the extent necessary so that the effects of such Impairment are borne solely by the holders of the Series of such First Lien Obligations subject to such Impairment. Additionally, in the event the First Lien Obligations of any Series are modified pursuant to applicable law (including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code or any other provision of any Bankruptcy Law), any reference to such First Lien Obligations or documents governing such First Lien Obligations shall refer to such obligations or such documents as so modified. If any First Lien Secured Party shall obtain possession of any Shared Collateral or shall realize any proceeds or payment in respect of any such Shared Collateral, pursuant to any First Lien Document or by the exercise of any rights available to it under applicable law or in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding or through any other exercise of remedies (including pursuant to any intercreditor agreement), at any time prior to the discharge of each Series of the First Lien Obligations, then it shall hold such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other First Lien Secured Parties and promptly transfer such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment, as the case may be, to the Controlling Collateral Agent, to be distributed in accordance with the waterfall provisions above. If, at any time the Controlling Collateral Agent forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any Shared Collateral resulting in a sale or disposition thereof, then (whether or not any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding is pending at the time) the Liens in favor of each other Collateral Agent for the benefit of each Series of First Lien Secured Parties upon such Shared Collateral will automatically be released and discharged as and when, but only to the extent, such Liens of the Controlling Collateral Agent on such Shared Collateral are released and discharged; provided, that any proceeds of any Shared Collateral realized therefrom shall be applied pursuant to the waterfall provisions above, subject to the Liens in favor of the First Lien Secured Parties on the same rights and priorities as set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. _Certain limitations applicable in bankruptcy proceedings_ The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding the commencement of any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding. If the Company and/or any Guarantor shall become subject to an Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding and shall, as debtor(s)-in-possession, move for approval of financing (“DIP Financing”) to be provided by one or more lenders (the “DIP Lenders”) to the Company or such Guarantor under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or any equivalent provision of any other Bankruptcy Law ----- and/or the use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code or any equivalent provision of any other Bankruptcy Law, each Authorized Representative (other than the Authorized Representative of any Controlling Secured Party) will not raise, join or support any objection to any such financing or to the Liens on the Shared Collateral securing the same (“DIP Financing Liens”) or to any use of cash collateral that constitutes Shared Collateral, unless the Controlling Collateral Agent (in the case of any Collateral Agent other than the First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent, acting on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative) shall then oppose or object to such DIP Financing or such DIP Financing Liens or use of cash collateral (and (i) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens are senior to the Liens on any such Shared Collateral for the benefit of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of the First Lien Secured Parties of the Series for which it is acting, will subordinate its Liens with respect to such Shared Collateral on the same terms as the Liens of the Controlling Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any First Lien Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) are subordinated thereto and (ii) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens rank pari passu with the Liens on any such Shared Collateral granted to secure the First Lien Obligations of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of the First Lien Secured Parties of the Series for which it is acting, will confirm the priorities with respect to such Shared Collateral as set forth herein), in each case, so long as (A) the First Lien Secured Parties of each Series retain the benefit of their Liens on all such Shared Collateral pledged to the DIP Lenders, including proceeds thereof arising after the commencement of such proceeding, with the same priority vis-à-vis all the other First Lien Secured Parties (other than any Liens of the First Lien Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as existed prior to the commencement of such Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, (B) the First Lien Secured Parties of each Series are granted Liens on any additional or replacement collateral pledged to any First Lien Secured Parties as adequate protection or otherwise in connection with such DIP Financing or use of cash collateral (in each case, except to the extent a Lien on additional or replacement collateral is granted to one Series in consideration of Collateral of such Series that is not Shared Collateral for a Series that does not receive a Lien on such additional or replacement collateral), with the same priority vis-à-vis the First Lien Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any First Lien Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, (C) if any amount of such DIP Financing and/or cash collateral is applied to repay any of the First Lien Obligations, such amount is applied pursuant to the waterfall provisions above (in each case, except to the extent a payment is made to one Series in consideration of Collateral of such Series that is not Shared Collateral for a Series that does not receive such payment) and (D) if any First Lien Secured Parties are granted adequate protection, including in the form of periodic payments, in connection with such DIP Financing and/or use of cash collateral, the proceeds of such adequate protection are applied pursuant to the waterfall provisions above (in each case, except to the extent such adequate protection is granted to one Series in consideration of Collateral of such Series that is not Shared Collateral for a Series that does not receive such adequate protection); provided, that the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement does not limit the right of the First Lien Secured Parties of each Series to object to the grant of a Lien to secure the DIP Financing over any Collateral subject to Liens in favor of the First Lien Secured Parties of such Series or its Authorized Representative that shall not constitute Shared Collateral; provided, further, that the First Lien Secured Parties receiving adequate protection shall not (other than as a provider of DIP Financing) object to or oppose (or support any other Person in objecting to or opposing) any other First Lien Secured Party receiving adequate protection comparable to any adequate protection granted to such First Lien Secured Parties in connection with a DIP Financing and/or use of cash collateral. The First Lien Obligations of any Series may, subject to the limitations set forth in the other First Lien Documents, be increased, extended, renewed, replaced, restated, supplemented, restructured, repaid, refunded, refinanced or otherwise amended or modified from time to time, all without affecting the priority of claims and application of proceeds set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement or the other provisions thereof defining the relative rights of the First Lien Secured Parties of any Series.",N/A,as_expected,2023,344

The Liens on the Collateral securing the Secured Notes and the related Note Guarantees also will be released (i) upon payment in full of the principal of, together with accrued and unpaid interest on, the Secured Notes and all other Obligations under the Secured Indenture, the related Note Guarantees and the Notes Collateral Documents that are due and payable at or prior to the time such principal, together with accrued and unpaid interest, are paid, (ii) upon a legal defeasance or covenant defeasance under the Secured Indenture as described below under “—Defeasance” or a discharge of the Secured Indenture as described under “—Satisfaction and Discharge” or (iii) pursuant to the Notes Collateral Documents or the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement described above.

In addition, upon the request of the Company or the applicable Guarantor, the Notes Collateral Agent may be required to subordinate its Lien over certain Collateral to certain other Permitted Liens that are permitted to have senior priority over such Collateral, including certain cash collateral, Lien securing Purchase Money Indebtedness or Finance Leases, in each case, pursuant to the terms of the Secured Indenture and the applicable Notes Collateral Documents.",N/A,as_expected,2023,344
1749_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.8,Security for the Secured Notes,21.8.9,Sufficiency of Collateral,"The fair market value of the Collateral is subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, general economic conditions, the availability of buyers and similar factors. The amount to be received upon a sale of the Collateral would also be dependent on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the actual fair market value of the Collateral at such time and the timing and the manner of the sale. By their nature, portions of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral can be sold in a short period of time or in an orderly manner. In addition, as discussed further below, the Holders of the Secured Notes will not be entitled to receive post-petition interest or applicable fees, costs, expenses, or charges to the extent the amount of the obligations due under the Secured Notes exceeds the value of the Collateral (after taking into account all other firstpriority debt that is also secured by the Collateral), or any “adequate protection” on account of any undersecured portion of the Secured Notes. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,344

Upon the commencement of a case for relief under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor such as the Notes Collateral Agent is prohibited from foreclosing upon or repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of previously repossessed security without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances or could be materially delayed). In view of the broad equitable powers of a U.S. bankruptcy court and the lack of a precise definition of the meaning of “adequate protection,” it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under the Secured Notes could be made following the commencement of a bankruptcy case (or the length of the delay in making any such payments), whether or when the Notes Collateral Agent could or would repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value of the Collateral at any time during a bankruptcy case or whether or to what extent Holders of the Secured Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral (through the provision of adequate protection or otherwise). The Bankruptcy Code permits the payment and/or accrual of post-petition interest, expenses, costs and fees to a secured creditor during a debtor’s bankruptcy case only to the extent the value of such creditor’s interest in the collateral is determined by the bankruptcy court to exceed the outstanding aggregate principal amount of all of the obligations secured by the collateral. Furthermore, in the event a domestic or foreign bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Secured Notes (after taking into account all other obligations secured thereby on a pari passu basis), the First Lien Notes Secured Parties would hold secured claims only to the extent of the value of the Collateral to which the Holders of the Secured Notes are entitled, and unsecured “deficiency” claims with respect to such shortfall, which deficiency claims would not be entitled to adequate protection during a bankruptcy case.",N/A,as_expected,2023,344

In the case of a global note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Secured Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice (including any conditions contained therein), Secured Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest ceases to accrue on Secured Notes or portions of them called for redemption.",N/A,as_expected,2023,344
1749_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.13,Change of Control,21.13.1,,"The Secured Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs, unless the Company has previously or substantially concurrently therewith delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Secured Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption,” the Company will make an offer to purchase all of the Secured Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase, subject to the right of Holders of the Secured Notes of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date. Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Company will deliver or cause to be delivered notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the procedures of DTC or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Secured Notes at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase the Secured Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Secured Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control as described below. ----- To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Secured Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Secured Indenture by virtue thereof. The Company may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Secured Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders of the Secured Notes to require that the Company repurchase or redeem the Secured Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control may constitute a default under the First Lien Credit Agreement that permits the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder. Future Indebtedness of the Company or its subsidiaries may contain prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Company to repurchase the Secured Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Company. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. Our ability to pay cash to the Holders of Secured Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control purchase feature of the Secured Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the initial purchasers of the Secured Notes and us. We have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control after the Issue Date, although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Secured Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants— Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in the Secured Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Secured Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Secured Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the Secured Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Secured Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all Secured Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Secured Notes has been given pursuant to the Secured Indenture as described above under the caption “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of Secured Notes may require the Company to make an offer to repurchase the Secured Notes as described above. ----- The provisions under the Secured Indenture relating to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Secured Notes then outstanding.",N/A,as_expected,2023,344

The period of time between the date of suspension of the covenants and the Reversion Date is referred to as the “Suspension Period.” The Company shall not be permitted to designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary during a Suspension Period unless such designation would be permitted if the Suspension Period was not in effect. ----- On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Completion Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period will not reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.” On the Reversion Date, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. Any Affiliate Transaction entered into after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period (to the extent not entered into in contemplation of the Reversion Date) will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Completion Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (6) of the second paragraph under “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions.” Any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to take any action described in clauses (A) through (C) of the first paragraph of “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have existed on the Completion Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (1) of the second paragraph under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries.” In addition, during a Suspension Period any future obligation to grant further Guarantees shall be suspended; provided that such obligation to grant Guarantees shall be reinstated upon the Reversion Date. No Default or Event of Default will be deemed to have occurred on the Reversion Date as a result of any actions taken by the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries during the Suspension Period. On and after each Reversion Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries will be permitted to consummate the transactions contemplated by any contract entered into during the Suspension Period, so long as such contract and such consummation would have been permitted during such Suspension Period and such contract was not entered into in contemplation of the Reversion Date. There can be no assurance that the Secured Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Status. The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the ratings of the Secured Notes, shall not be deemed to have any knowledge of the ratings of the Secured Notes and shall have no duty to notify Holders if the Secured Notes achieve Investment Grade Status or of the occurrence of a Reversion Date or to independently determine if such events have occurred.",N/A,as_expected,2023,344

(8) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness; (9) for all purposes under the Secured Indenture, including for purposes of calculating the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated First Lien Secured Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, as applicable, in connection with the incurrence, issuance or assumption of any Indebtedness pursuant to the first or second paragraph above or the incurrence or creation of any Lien pursuant to the definition of “Permitted Liens” or otherwise, the Company may elect, at its option, to treat all or any portion of the committed amount of any Indebtedness (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) which is to be incurred (or any commitment in respect thereof) or secured by such Lien, as the case may be (any such committed amount elected until revoked as described below, the “Reserved Indebtedness Amount”), as being incurred as of such election date, and, if such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated First Lien Secured Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio or other provision of the Secured Indenture, as applicable, is complied with (or satisfied) with respect thereto on such election date, any subsequent borrowing or reborrowing thereunder (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be deemed to ----- be permitted under this covenant or the definition of “Permitted Liens,” as applicable, whether or not the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated First Lien Secured Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio or other provision of the Secured Indenture, as applicable, at the actual time of any subsequent borrowing or reborrowing (or issuance or creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) is complied with (or satisfied) for all purposes (including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of Default); provided that for the purposes of subsequent calculations of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated First Lien Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, as applicable, the Reserved Indebtedness Amount shall be deemed to be outstanding, whether or not such amount is actually outstanding, for so long as such commitments are outstanding or until the Company revokes an election of a Reserved Indebtedness Amount; (10) notwithstanding anything in this covenant or any other covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness incurred to refinance Indebtedness initially incurred in reliance on a clause of the second paragraph of this covenant measured by reference to a percentage of LTM EBITDA at the time of Incurrence, if such refinancing would cause the percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of LTM EBITDA on the date of such refinancing, such percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus accrued and unpaid interest, dividends, premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting discounts, fees, costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) in connection with such refinancing; and (11) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of GAAP. Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in GAAP, shall in each case be deemed to be a permitted Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Company shall be in default of this covenant). For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit debt; provided, that if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed (a) the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus (b) the aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid interest, dividends, premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting discounts, fees, costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred in connection with such refinancing. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be ----- calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. The Secured Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured or (2) senior Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other senior Indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral or is secured by different collateral or because it is guaranteed by different obligors.",N/A,as_expected,2023,344

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Secured Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws, rules and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Secured Indenture by virtue thereof. The provisions of the Secured Indenture relative to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Secured Notes as a result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Secured Notes. The First Lien Credit Agreement may prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Company becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Company from purchasing any Secured Notes pursuant to this covenant. In the event the Company is prohibited from purchasing the Secured Notes, the Company could seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase of the Secured Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Company does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, it will remain prohibited from purchasing the Secured Notes. In such case, the Company’s failure to purchase tendered Secured Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Secured Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2023,344

or (b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its stated final maturity (the “cross acceleration provision”); and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default of principal at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates to the greater of $236.4 million and 30.0% of LTM EBITDA (measured at the date of such non-payment or acceleration) or more at any one time outstanding; (5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of Parent, the Company or a Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy provisions”);

However, a Default under clause (4) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Secured Notes notify the Company of the Default (with a copy to the Trustee, if notice is given by the Holders) and, with respect to clause (6), the Company does not cure such Default within the time specified in clause (6) of this paragraph after receipt of such notice; provided that a notice of Default may not be given with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to Holders, more than two years prior to such notice of Default. Any notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, to provide a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders (each a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such Holder delivered to the Company, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, that such Holder is not (or, in the case such Holder is DTC or its nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that are not) Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to the delivery of a notice of Default shall be deemed a continuing representation until the resulting Event of Default is ----- cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Secured Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder is deemed, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, to covenant to provide the Company with such other information as the Company may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Noteholder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is DTC or its nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Secured Notes in lieu of DTC or its nominee and DTC shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Position Representation and Verification Covenant in delivering its direction to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Secured Notes, the Company determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and provides to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Company has initiated litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default or acceleration (or notice thereof) that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Secured Notes, the Company provides to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, an Officer’s Certificate stating that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Default or Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Holder, the percentage of Secured Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio (other than any indemnity such Directing Holder may have offered to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable), with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, acceleration voided and neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall be deemed to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such Default or Event of Default. Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction delivered to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraphs. For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction delivered to it in accordance with the Secured Indenture and shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any Position Representation, enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any Officer’s Certificate delivered to it, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise. Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall have any liability to the Company, any Holder or any other Person in acting in good faith on a Noteholder Direction. If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above with respect to the Company) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Company or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Secured Notes by written notice to the Company and the Trustee may declare the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Secured Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Secured Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (4) under “— Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Secured Notes shall be automatically annulled, waived and rescinded if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, in each case, within 30 days ----- after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and the annulment of the acceleration of the Secured Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above with respect to the Company occurs and is continuing, the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Secured Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Secured Notes under the Secured Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal or interest which may only be waived with the consent of each affected Holder) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Secured Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. The Secured Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “— Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of this Secured Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Secured Indenture. Any time period in the Secured Indenture to cure any actual or alleged Default or Event of Default may be extended or stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction to the extent such actual or alleged Default or Event of Default is the subject of litigation. Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent will be under any obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Secured Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered and, if requested, provided to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Secured Indenture or the Secured Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Secured Notes have requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holders have offered in writing and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request and the offer of security or indemnity; and (5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Secured Notes have not given the Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Secured Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable. The Secured Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and is actually known or notified in writing to a responsible officer of the Trustee, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Secured Indenture or that the ----- Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability (it being understood that the Trustee has no duty to determine if any directed action is prejudicial to any Holder). Prior to taking any action under the Secured Indenture, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, will be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it against all fees, losses, liabilities and expenses that may be caused by taking or not taking such action. The Secured Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Company, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Company. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of or interest on any Secured Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent will be deemed to have knowledge of any Defaults or Events of Default unless written notice of an event, which is in fact a Default, has been delivered to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, at its office specified in the Secured Indenture and such notice references the Secured Notes and the Secured Indenture and states that it is a “Notice of Default”.",N/A,as_expected,2023,344

(the “Secured Notes”). In this description, (i) the terms “we,” “our” and “us” each refer (a) prior to the consummation of the Merger, to Star Parent, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), and not to any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries, and (b) from and after the consummation of the Merger, to the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries taken together; (ii) the term “Company” refers only to Star Parent, Inc. and not any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries; and (iii) the term “Parent” refers only to Star Holdings, Inc. and not any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries. Certain terms used in this description are defined under the subheading “—Certain Definitions.” The Company will issue the Secured Notes under an indenture (the “Secured Indenture”) to be dated as of the Issue Date between the Company, Parent and Citibank, N.A., a national banking association organized and existing under the laws of the United States, acting through its Agency & Trust business not in its individual capacity but solely in its respective capacities as trustee (in such capacity, the “Trustee”) and notes collateral agent (in such capacity, the “Notes Collateral Agent”). If applicable, on the Issue Date, the gross proceeds from this offering of Secured Notes will be deposited into escrow pursuant to certain customary escrow arrangements as set forth in the Escrow Agreement (as defined below). Such gross proceeds will be released therefrom upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. For more information about the terms of the escrow arrangements and special mandatory redemption feature, see “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.” On the Completion Date (as defined below), the gross proceeds will be released from escrow, and the Subsidiary Guarantors (as defined below) will execute a supplemental indenture pursuant to which the Subsidiary Guarantors will provide a guarantee of the Secured Notes, and the Subsidiary Guarantors will become parties to the Secured Indenture and the applicable Notes Collateral Documents. If the Merger will be consummated on the Issue Date, the Company will issue the Secured Notes, and the Guarantors, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent will enter into the Secured Indenture and the applicable Notes Collateral Documents. The Secured Notes will be issued in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. See “Transfer Restrictions.” The Secured Notes are subject to all such terms pursuant to the provisions of the Secured Indenture, and Holders are referred to the Secured Indenture for a statement thereof. The following is a summary of the material provisions of the Secured Indenture and the Escrow Agreement. Because this is a summary, it may not contain all the information that is important to you. You should read the Secured Indenture and the Escrow Agreement in their entirety. Copies of the proposed forms of the Secured Indenture and the Escrow Agreement may be requested as described under “Where You Can Find Additional Information.” You can find the definitions of certain terms used in this description under “—Certain Definitions.” The capitalized terms defined in “—Certain Definitions” below are used in this “Description of the Notes” as so defined. The Company does not intend to list the Secured Notes on any securities exchange. The Company will not be required to, nor does the Company currently intend to, offer to exchange the Secured Notes for notes registered under the Securities Act or otherwise register or qualify by prospectus the Secured Notes for resale under the Securities Act. The Secured Indenture will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act or subject to the terms of the Trust Indenture Act. Accordingly, the terms of the Secured Notes include only those stated in the Secured Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2023,344
1749_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,239,"BOOK ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM",239.1,Depository Procedures,239.1.1,,"The following description of the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream is provided solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. We take no responsibility for these operations and procedures and urge investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these matters. DTC has advised us that it is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities for its participating organizations (collectively, the “Participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and ----- settlement of transactions in those securities between the Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its Participants. The Participants include securities brokers and dealers (including the initial purchasers), banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC’s system is also available to other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the “Indirect Participants”). Persons who are not Participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through the Participants or the Indirect Participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership interests in, each security held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the Participants and Indirect Participants. DTC has also advised us that, pursuant to procedures established by it: (1) upon deposit of the Rule 144A Global Notes and the Regulation S Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of Participants designated by the initial purchasers with portions of the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Notes and the Regulation S Global Notes; and (2) ownership of these interests in Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership of these interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the Participants) or by the Participants and the Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interests in Global Notes). Investors in Rule 144A Global Notes who are Participants may hold their interests therein directly through DTC. Investors in Rule 144A Global Notes who are not Participants may hold their interests therein indirectly through organizations (including Euroclear and Clearstream) that are Participants. Investors in Regulation S Global Notes must initially hold their interests therein through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are participants in those systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants. After the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period (but not earlier), investors may also hold interests in Regulation S Global Notes through Participants in the DTC system other than Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in Regulation S Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositories, which in turn hold such interests in customers’ securities accounts in the depositaries’ names on the books of DTC. All interests in a Global Note, including those held through Euroclear or Clearstream, may be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC. Those interests held through Euroclear or Clearstream may also be subject to the procedures and requirements of such systems. The laws of some states require that certain persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to such persons will be limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of Participants, which in turn act on behalf of Indirect Participants, the ability of a person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge those interests to persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of those interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing those interests. Except as described below, owners of an interest in Global Notes will not have Notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of Certificated Notes and will not be considered the registered owners or “Holders” thereof under the indenture governing the Notes for any purpose. Payments in respect of the principal of, and interest and premium, if any, on, a Global Note registered in the name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the registered Holder under the indenture governing the Notes. Under the terms of the indenture, the Issuer and the Trustee will treat the persons in whose names Notes, including Global Notes, are registered as the owners of such Notes for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustee or any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee has or will have any responsibility or liability for: (1) any aspect of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in Global Notes; or ----- (2) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its Participants or Indirect Participants. DTC has advised us that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as the Notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the payment on the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe it will not receive payment on that payment date. Each relevant Participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by the Participants and the Indirect Participants to the beneficial owners of Notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of the Participants or the Indirect Participants and will not be the responsibility of DTC, the Trustee or the Issuer. Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee will be liable for any delay by DTC or any of its Participants in identifying the beneficial owners of any Notes, and the Issuer and the Trustee may conclusively rely on and will be protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all purposes. Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth under “Transfer Restrictions,” transfers between the Participants in DTC will be effected in accordance with DTC’s procedures, and will be settled in same-day funds, and transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures. Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the Notes described herein, cross-market transfers between the Participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by their respective depositary; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its respective depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant Global Note from DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to or from DTC, as applicable. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the depositories for Euroclear or Clearstream. DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a Holder of Notes only at the direction of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and only in respect of the portion of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes as to which that Participant or those Participants has or have given the relevant direction. However, if there is an Event of Default under the Notes, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for legended notes in certificated form, and to distribute those notes to its Participants. Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among Participants, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform those procedures, and may discontinue or change those procedures at any time. Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee nor any of their respective agents will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or their respective Participants or Indirect Participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.",N/A,as_expected,2023,344

Beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the Regulation S Global Note, whether before or after the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, only if the transferor first delivers to the Issuer and the Registrar a written certificate (in the form provided in the indenture) to the effect that the transfer is being made in accordance with Rule 903 or Rule 904 of Regulation S or Rule 144 (if available) and that, if such transfer occurs prior to the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, the interest transferred will be held immediately thereafter through Euroclear or Clearstream. Transfers involving exchanges of beneficial interests between a Regulation S Global Note and a Rule 144A Global Note will be effected in DTC by means of an instruction originated by the Participant through the DTC Deposit/Withdraw at Custodian system. Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect the changes in the principal amounts of the Regulation S Global Note and the Rule 144A Global Note, as applicable. Any beneficial interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in the original Global Note and will become an interest in the other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial interest in the other Global Note for so long as it remains such an interest.

We expect that secondary trading in any Certificated Notes will also be settled in immediately available funds. Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant purchasing an interest in a Global Note from a Participant will be credited, and any such crediting will be reported to the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream participant, during the securities settlement processing day (which must be a business day for Euroclear and Clearstream) immediately following the settlement date of DTC.

Such contingencies may implicate the provisions of the Regulations relating to “contingent payment debt instruments.” We intend to take the position that the contingencies associated with the Notes should not cause the Notes to be subject to the contingent payment debt instrument rules. Our determination that the Notes are not subject to the contingent payment debt instrument rules is binding on a beneficial owner, unless such beneficial owner explicitly discloses to the IRS on its tax return for the year during which it acquires the Notes that it is taking a different position. Our position is not binding, however, on the IRS. If the IRS takes a position contrary to that described above, then the Notes may be treated as contingent payment debt instruments and a beneficial owner subject to U.S. federal income taxation may be required to accrue interest income on the Notes at a rate in excess of the stated interest based upon a “comparable yield.” The “comparable yield” is the yield at which we would issue a fixed rate debt instrument with no contingent payments, but with terms and conditions similar to those of the Notes. In addition, any gain on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Notes would be treated as ordinary income rather than as capital gain. Each holder of Notes should consult its tax advisor regarding the tax considerations of the Notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments.

For purposes of this summary, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes: - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; - a corporation organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; ----- - an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or - a trust, if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary jurisdiction over its administration and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all of its substantial decisions, or (ii) a valid election is in place under applicable Regulations to treat such trust as a domestic trust. _Stated Interest_ Stated interest on a Note will be included in the gross income of a U.S. Holder as ordinary income at the time that such interest is accrued or received, in accordance with the holder’s regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. _Sale, Exchange, Redemption, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition_ Upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the amount realized upon the disposition and (ii) the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note. The amount realized will be equal to the sum of the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received in exchange for the Note, less any portion allocable to any accrued and unpaid stated interest, which portion will be taxed as ordinary interest income (as described above under “—Stated Interest”) to the extent not previously so taxed. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note generally will equal the cost of the Note to such U.S. Holder. Any such capital gain or loss will be longterm capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder has held the Note for more than one year. In general, long-term capital gains of individual and other noncorporate U.S. Holders are taxed at lower rates than those applicable to ordinary income. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Each U.S. Holder should consult its tax advisor as to the deductibility of capital losses in their particular circumstances. _Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_ In general, the applicable withholding agent must report certain information to the IRS with respect to payments of stated interest, and payments of the proceeds of the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Notes, to certain U.S. Holders. The applicable withholding agent also may be required to impose backup withholding (currently at the rate of 24%), if (i) the payee fails to furnish a taxpayer identification number (“TIN”) to the applicable withholding agent or to otherwise establish an exemption from backup withholding; (ii) the IRS notifies the applicable withholding agent that the TIN furnished by the payee is incorrect; (iii) there has been a notified payee underreporting described in Section 3406(c) of the Code; or (iv) the payee has not certified under penalties of perjury that it has furnished a correct TIN and that the IRS has not notified the payee that it is subject to backup withholding under the Code. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules from a payment to a U.S. Holder generally will be allowed as a credit against that U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, and may entitle the U.S. Holder to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.",N/A,as_expected,2023,344

For purposes of this summary, the term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, an individual, corporation, estate or trust that is not a U.S. Holder. _U.S. Federal Withholding Tax_ Subject to the discussions of backup withholding and FATCA (as defined below), interest paid on a Note to a Non-U.S. Holder will be exempt from U.S. federal withholding tax, provided that: ----- - interest paid on the Note is not effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States; - the Non-U.S. Holder does not, actually or constructively, own stock possessing 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of our voting stock and is not a controlled foreign corporation related to us, actually or constructively; - the Non-U.S. Holder is not a bank that acquired the Notes in consideration for an extension of credit made pursuant to a loan agreement entered into in the ordinary course of its trade or business; and - either (a) the Non-U.S. Holder provides its name and address on a properly executed IRS Form W8BEN or W-8BEN-E delivered to the applicable withholding agent, and certifies, under penalties of perjury, that it is not a U.S. person as defined under the Code or (b) the Non-U.S. Holder holds its Notes through certain intermediaries and satisfies the certification requirements under applicable Regulations. If a Non-U.S. Holder cannot satisfy the requirements described above, payments of interest made to such Non-U.S. Holder on the Notes generally will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at the rate of 30%, unless the Non-U.S. Holder provides the applicable withholding agent with a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN or W8BEN-E (or other applicable form) establishing an exemption from or reduction in the withholding tax under the benefit of an applicable income tax treaty or IRS Form W-8ECI stating that interest paid on the Notes is not subject to withholding tax because it is effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States (as discussed below under “—U.S. Federal Income Tax”). Subject to the discussion below under “—U.S. Federal Income Tax” and the discussions of backup withholding and FATCA (as defined below), the 30% U.S. federal withholding tax generally will not apply to any gain recognized by a Non-U.S. Holder on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note (other than amounts properly attributable to accrued and unpaid interest, which will be treated as described above). _U.S. Federal Income Tax_ Unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise, if a Non-U.S. Holder is engaged in a trade or business in the United States and interest on a Note is effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or business, then the Non-U.S. Holder will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on that interest on a net income basis (although such Non-U.S. Holder will be exempt from the 30% U.S. federal withholding tax, provided the certification requirements discussed above in “—U.S. Federal Withholding Tax” are satisfied) in the same manner as if the Non-U.S. Holder were a U.S. person as defined under the Code. In addition, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation, such Non-U.S. Holder may be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% (or lower applicable income tax treaty rate) of its effectively connected earnings and profits, subject to adjustments. Subject to the discussion of FATCA below, a Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain recognized on a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note (other than in respect of any amount representing accrued but unpaid interest on the Note, which is subject to the rules discussed herein for interest), unless (i) the gain is effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States (in which case, such gain generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax (and possibly the branch profits tax) in generally the same manner as applies to effectively connected interest income described above), or (ii) the Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of the disposition of a Note and certain other requirements are met (in which case, such Non-U.S. Holder generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a flat rate of 30% (unless a lower applicable income tax treaty rate applies) on any such Non-U.S. Holder’s gain (net of certain U.S.-source losses, if any). ----- _Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_ Information returns will be filed with the IRS in connection with payments of interest on the Notes made to a Non-U.S. Holder. Unless a Non-U.S. Holder complies with certification procedures to establish that it is not a United States person, information returns may also be filed with the IRS in connection with the proceeds from a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note. A Non-U.S. Holder may be subject to backup withholding on interest payments on the Notes or the proceeds from a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Notes unless such Non-U.S. Holder complies with certification procedures to establish that it is not a United States person or otherwise establish an exemption. The certification procedures required to claim the exemption from withholding tax on interest described above will eliminate backup withholding as well. Copies of any information returns filed with the IRS may also be made available to the tax authorities in the country in which a Non-U.S. Holder resides or is organized under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules are not additional taxes and may be refunded or credited against a Non-U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.",N/A,as_expected,2023,344

An intergovernmental agreement between the U.S. and the applicable foreign country, or future Regulations or other guidance, may modify these requirements. Proposed Regulations propose to eliminate potential FATCA withholding on the gross proceeds of a disposition of a Note. The proposed Regulations provide that taxpayers may rely upon such proposal until final Regulations are issued. We will not pay additional amounts or “gross up” payments to holders of the Notes as a result of any taxes or withholding imposed under FATCA. Under certain circumstances, a Non-U.S. Holder may be eligible for a refund or credit of such tax or withholding.

This summary is general in nature and does not discuss all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a holder of Notes in light of its particular circumstances. In addition, this summary does not describe any U.S. federal tax considerations other than income tax considerations (such as estate or gift tax considerations, or the Medicare tax on net investment income) or any state, local or non-U.S. tax considerations. This summary is based on the provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder (“Regulations”), judicial authority, administrative pronouncements of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other applicable authorities, all as in effect on the date of this offering circular. Changes in such authorities or new interpretations thereof may have retroactive effect and could significantly affect the U.S. federal income tax considerations discussed below. We have not sought any ruling from the IRS with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary, and there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will agree with our statements and conclusions or that a court would not sustain any challenge by the IRS in the event of litigation. This summary deals only with Notes that are purchased for cash in this offering at their “issue price” (the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold for money to investors, not including bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) and that are held as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). In addition, this summary does not address U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to investors that may be subject to special tax rules, such as: - banks, insurance companies or other financial institutions; - persons subject to the alternative minimum tax; - persons subject to Section 451(b) of the Code; - dealers or traders in securities; - brokers; - traders that have elected mark-to-market tax accounting treatment; - retirement plans and other tax-deferred accounts; - tax-exempt entities; - S corporations, partnerships or other pass through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes or investors in such entities; - real estate investment trusts; - regulated investment companies; - non-U.S. trusts or estates with U.S. beneficiaries; - U.S. persons whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar; - investors that hold the Notes as part of a straddle, synthetic security or conversion transaction; ----- - controlled foreign corporations; - passive foreign investment companies; - corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax; - U.S. Holders who hold Notes through non-U.S. brokers or other non-U.S. intermediaries; and - former citizens or residents of the United States subject to Section 877 of the Code. In the case of a holder of Notes that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the tax treatment of the Notes to the partnership or a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the tax status of the partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership. A partner in a partnership considering an investment in the Notes should consult its tax advisor regarding an investment in the Notes. The following summary is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for careful tax planning and advice. Each investor considering an investment in the Notes should consult its tax advisor with respect to the application of the U.S. federal income tax laws to such investor’s particular situations, as well as any tax considerations arising under any other U.S. federal tax laws or the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction or under any applicable tax treaty.",N/A,as_expected,2023,344
1749_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,107,CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS,107.1,General Fiduciary Matters,107.1.1,,"ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (an “ERISA Plan”) and prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation (direct or indirect) to such an ERISA Plan or has authority or responsibility to do so, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan. Any Plan fiduciary that proposes to cause a Plan to purchase the Notes should consult with its counsel regarding the potential applicability of the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA and the prohibited transaction provisions of Title I of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code and provisions of any Similar Law to such an investment, and to confirm that the acquisition and holding of the Notes will not constitute or result in a nonexempt prohibited transaction or any other violation of an applicable requirement of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law or whether an exemption would be applicable to such acquisition and holding. In addition, in considering an investment in the Notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a Plan fiduciary should determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws. Each Plan should also consider the fact that none of the Issuer, the initial purchasers, any guarantors or any of their respective affiliates (collectively, the “Transaction Parties”) is acting, or will act, as a fiduciary to any Plan with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes pursuant to this offering. The Transaction Parties are not undertaking to provide any investment advice in a fiduciary capacity with respect to such decision. All communications, correspondence and materials from the Transaction Parties with respect to the Notes are intended to be general in nature and are not directed at any specific purchaser of the Notes, and do not constitute advice regarding the advisability of investment in the Notes for any specific purchaser. The decision to purchase and hold the Notes must be made solely by each prospective Plan purchaser on an arm’s length basis.",N/A,as_expected,2023,344
1749_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,107,CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS,107.2,Prohibited Transaction Issues,107.2.1,,"Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified transactions involving “plan assets” with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of Section 3(14) of ERISA, or “disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption is available. Those sections further prohibit a fiduciary from engaging in transactions in which a conflict of interest is deemed present. The fiduciary of an ERISA Plan that proposes to purchase and hold any Notes should consider, among other things, whether such purchase and holding may involve (i) the direct or indirect extension of credit between an ERISA Plan and a party in interest or a disqualified person, (ii) the sale or exchange of any property between an ERISA Plan and a party in interest or a disqualified person, or (iii) the transfer to, or use by or for the benefit of, a party in interest or disqualified person, of any ERISA Plan assets. Such parties in interest or disqualified persons could include, without limitation, the Issuer, the initial purchasers or any of their respective affiliates. A party in interest or disqualified person (including a fiduciary) who engages in a non-exempt prohibited ----- transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and/or the Code. In addition, a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engages in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. The acquisition and/or holding of the Notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which an Issuer, an initial purchaser or a guarantor is considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the Notes are acquired and held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may provide exemptive relief for direct or indirect prohibited transactions resulting from the acquisition and/or holding of the Notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting life insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers. In addition to the foregoing, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide a statutory exemption for certain transactions between an ERISA Plan and a person that is a party in interest and/or a disqualified person (other than a fiduciary or an affiliate that (directly or indirectly) has or exercises any discretionary authority or control or renders any investment advice with respect to the assets of any ERISA Plan involved in the transaction) solely by reason of providing services to the ERISA Plan or by relationship to a service provider, provided that the ERISA Plan pays no more and receives no less than adequate consideration in connection with the transaction. These exemptions do not, however, provide relief from the self-dealing prohibitions under ERISA and the Code. It should also be noted that even if the conditions specified in one or more of these exemptions are met, the scope of relief provided by these exemptions may not necessarily cover all acts that might be construed as prohibited transactions. Therefore, the fiduciary of an ERISA Plan that is considering acquiring and/or holding the Notes in reliance on any of these, or any other, exemptions should carefully review the exemption and consult with its counsel to confirm that it is applicable. There can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied with respect to transactions involving the Notes. Governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA) and certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA), while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to Similar Laws which may affect their investment in the Notes. Any fiduciary of a governmental, non-U.S. or such a church plan considering an investment in the Notes should consult with its counsel before purchasing Notes to consider the applicable fiduciary standards and to determine the need for, and, if necessary, the availability of, any exemptive relief under any applicable Similar Laws. Because of the foregoing, the Notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing “plan assets” of any Plan, unless such purchase or holding will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Code or violation of any applicable Similar Laws. The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive nor should it be construed as legal advice. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries or other persons considering purchasing or holding the Notes on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the Notes. Purchasers of the Notes have the exclusive responsibility for ensuring that their purchase and holding of the Notes complies with the fiduciary responsibility rules of ERISA and does not violate the prohibited transaction rules of ERISA or the Code or provisions of any applicable Similar Laws. Neither we nor the initial purchasers make any representation as to whether an investment in the Notes is appropriate for Plans in general or whether such investment is appropriate for any particular Plan. Neither this discussion nor anything in this offering circular is or is intended to be investment advice directed at any potential purchaser that is a Plan or at such purchasers generally. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,344

We and the guarantors, jointly and severally, have agreed to indemnify the initial purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments the initial purchasers may be required to make in respect of those liabilities. The representative has advised us that the initial purchasers propose initially to offer the Notes for resale at the offering price that appears on the cover of this offering circular. After the initial offering, the offering price of the Notes and any other term of the offering may be changed. The initial purchasers may offer and sell Notes through certain of their affiliates. The offering of the Notes by the initial purchasers is subject to receipt and acceptance of orders by the initial purchasers and subject to the initial purchasers’ right to reject any order in whole or in part. The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Notes are subject to restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Transfer Restrictions.” In the purchase agreement, each of the initial purchasers has agreed that: - the Notes may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except in accordance with Rule 144A or Regulation S under the Securities Act; and - during the initial distribution of the Notes, it will offer or sell Notes only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in compliance with Rule 144A and to non-U.S. persons outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S. ----- In addition, with respect to the Notes initially sold outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S, until 40 days following the commencement of this offering, an offer or sale of Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act unless the dealer makes the offer or sale in compliance with Rule 144A or another exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Each purchaser of the Notes will be deemed to have made acknowledgments, representations and agreements as described under “Transfer Restrictions.” The Notes are a new issue of securities, and there is currently no established trading market for the Notes. In addition, the Notes are subject to certain restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Transfer Restrictions.” We do not intend to apply for the Notes to be listed on any securities exchange or to arrange for the inclusion of the Notes on any automated dealer quotation system. Certain of the initial purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes, but are not obligated to do so. The initial purchasers may discontinue any market making in the Notes at any time in their sole discretion. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid trading market for the Notes will develop or be maintained, that you will be able to sell your Notes at a particular time or that the prices that you receive when you sell will be favorable. If the Notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our operating performance and financial condition, general economic conditions and other factors. In addition, the ability of the initial purchasers to make a market in the Notes may be impacted by changes in any regulatory requirements (including as a result of regulatory developments such as the SEC’s interpretation of Rule 15c2-11 and its application to debt securities) applicable to the marketing, holding and trading of, and issuing quotations with respect to, the Notes. The Issuer and the guarantors have agreed that they and their respective affiliates will not for a period of 90 days following the closing of this offering, without the prior written consent of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, offer, sell or contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of (or enter into any transaction that is designed to, or might reasonably be expected to, result in the disposition (whether by actual disposition or effective economic disposition due to cash settlement or otherwise) by them or their respective affiliates or any person in privity with them or their respective affiliates), directly or indirectly, or announce the offering of, any capital markets debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Issuer or any of the guarantors. We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about , 2023, which will be the     business day following the date of pricing of the Notes (such settlement cycle being herein referred to as “T+     “). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes prior to the date that is two business days preceding the settlement date will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will settle T+    , to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of Notes who wish to trade Notes during such period should consult their own advisor. The initial purchasers and their affiliates have in the past engaged, currently engage in and may in the future engage in transactions with and perform services for us, including commercial banking, financial advisory and investment banking services, in the ordinary course of business for which they have received or will receive customary fees and expenses. It is expected that affiliates of each of the initial purchasers will act as agents, joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners and/or lenders under our New Credit Facilities and will receive customary fees for performing those services. Affiliates of each of the initial purchasers have provided commitments in respect of a senior secured bridge facility. Commitments under such bridge facility will be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the aggregate principal amount of notes sold in this offering and, as a result, the commitments held by such affiliates will be ratably reduced. Furthermore, certain of the initial purchasers and/or their respective affiliates may be lenders under the Existing Credit Agreement and/or holders of the Existing Notes, and therefore such initial purchasers and/or their affiliates may receive a portion of the net proceeds of this offering used to finance the Merger and the related Debt Refinancing. See “Use of Proceeds.” In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the initial purchasers and their respective affiliates, officers, directors and employees may purchase, sell or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments for their own account and for the accounts of their customers, and such investment and trading activities may involve ----- or relate to assets, securities and/or instruments of the Issuer (directly, as collateral securing other obligations or otherwise) and/or persons and entities with relationships with the Issuer. The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates may also communicate independent investment recommendations, market color or trading ideas and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such assets, securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they should acquire, long and/or short positions in such assets, securities and instruments. If any of the initial purchasers or their affiliates has a lending relationship with us, certain of those initial purchasers or their affiliates routinely hedge, and certain other of those initial purchasers or their affiliates may hedge, their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. A typical hedging strategy would include these initial purchasers or their affiliates hedging such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. In connection with the offering of the Notes, the initial purchasers may engage in overallotment, stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions. Overallotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the initial purchasers. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the Notes in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of those transactions. If the initial purchasers engage in stabilizing or syndicate covering transactions, they may discontinue them at any time without notice. Neither we nor any of the initial purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2023,344

Basis of Presentation,3234.1.1,The Company,"Syneos Health, Inc. (the “Company”) is a global provider of end-to-end biopharmaceutical outsourcing solutions. The Company operates under two reportable segments, Clinical Solutions and Commercial Solutions, and derives its revenue through a suite of services designed to enhance its customers’ ability to successfully develop, launch, and market their products. The Company offers its solutions on both a standalone and integrated basis with biopharmaceutical development and commercialization services ranging from Phase I to IV clinical trial services to services associated with the commercialization of biopharmaceutical products. The Company’s customers include small, mid-sized, and large companies in the biopharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device industries. On May 10, 2023, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Star Parent, Inc., an affiliated entity of Elliott Investment Management, Patient Square Capital, Veritas Capital (“Parent”), and Star Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”). The Merger Agreement provides that, at closing (the “Effective Time”), Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. At closing, each share of Class A common stock of the Company issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled and extinguished and, except for limited exceptions, automatically converted into the right to receive $43.00 in cash (the “Merger Consideration”). At a special meeting held on August 2, 2023, the Company’s stockholders approved the Merger Agreement. Certain regulatory approvals relating to the Merger remain pending. If the Merger is consummated, the Company’s shares of Class A common stock will no longer trade on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (""Nasdaq"") and will be deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. As a result, the Company will become a private company. As of June 30, 2023, the Company has incurred approximately $23.0 million of costs in connection with the Merger and expects to continue to incur significant costs and expenses, including fees for professional services and other transaction costs.",N/A,as_expected,2023,344

In its complaint, the Plaintiff alleges that the UAPP Defendants violated Section 10(b) and Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, by allegedly disseminating or approving statements, which they knew or deliberately disregarded were false and misleading. The lawsuit brings claims on behalf of a putative class of purchasers of the Company’s Class A common stock between September 9, 2020 and November 3, 2022, and seeks compensatory damages, attorneys’ fees and costs, and any equitable or injunctive relief the court deems just and proper. On December 1, 2017, the first of two virtually identical actions alleging federal securities law claims was filed against the Company and certain of its officers on behalf of a putative class of its shareholders. The first action, captioned Bermudez v. INC Research, Inc., et al, No. 17-09457 (S.D.N.Y.), was filed in the Southern District of New York (the “Bermudez action”), and the second action, Vaitkuvienë v. Syneos Health, Inc., et al, No. 18-0029 (E.D.N.C.), was filed on January 25, 2018 in the Eastern District of North Carolina (the “Vaitkuvienë action”). On March 30, 2018, the Bermudez action was dismissed voluntarily. After the San Antonio Fire & Police Pension Fund and El Paso Firemen & Policemen’s Pension Fund were appointed as Lead Plaintiffs in the Vaitkuvienë action, Lead Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on July 30, 2018, which named as defendants the Company, Alistair Macdonald, Gregory S. Rush, Michael A. Bell, and each member of the Company’s Board at the time of the stockholder vote on the 2017 merger (the “Merger”) of INC Research with an affiliate of inVentiv Health, Inc. (“inVentiv”) (collectively, the “Vaitkuvienë Defendants”). The amended complaint alleged claims under Sections 10(b), 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of a putative class of purchasers of the Company’s common stock between May 10, 2017 and November 8, 2017, contending that the Company published inaccurate or incomplete information regarding, among other things, the financial performance and business outlook for inVentiv’s business prior to and following the Merger. Lead Plaintiffs sought, among other things, orders (i) declaring that the lawsuit is a proper class action and (ii) awarding compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial, including interest thereon, and reasonable costs and expenses incurred in this action, including attorneys’ fees and expert fees, to Lead Plaintiffs and other class members. On September 20, 2018, the Vaitkuvienë Defendants moved to dismiss the action. On August 30, 2021, the District Court entered an order granting the motion to dismiss in its entirety, and on October 21, 2021, the Court entered judgment for the Vaitkuvienë Defendants. On November 19, 2021, Lead Plaintiffs appealed from this judgment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, and, on July 24, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the District Court judgment in favor of defendants.",N/A,as_expected,2023,344

Syneos Health, Inc. et al, Case No. 1:23-cv-00749, was filed in the United States District Court of Delaware on July 10, 2023; and Williams v. Syneos Health, Inc. et al, Case No. 23-cv-05867, was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on July 10, 2023. Each of the complaints name as defendants the Company and certain members of the Board, and the Delman complaint also names as defendants Centerview, BofA Securities, Broadridge, and the Company's proxy solicitors. Each of the complaints (other than the Delman complaint) allege violations of Sections 14(e) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder. The O’Dell and Wang complaints generally allege that the Schedule 14(a) Preliminary Proxy Statement, filed with the SEC on June 15, 2023, and the Kent and Williams complaints generally allege that the definitive proxy statement filed with the SEC on June 27, 2023 (the “Proxy Statement”), omit material information with respect to the proposed transaction and the valuation analyses performed by the Company’s financial advisors regarding the proposed transaction, which renders the Proxy Statement false and misleading. The Delman complaint alleged violations of the North Carolina Securities Act and negligent misrepresentation and concealment under North Carolina and New York common law by the Company, the members of the Board, Centerview, BofA Securities, Broadridge, and the Company’s proxy solicitors. The complaints seek, among other relief, to enjoin the Company from consummating the Merger and to be awarded rescissory damages, as well as attorneys’ fees, costs, and disbursements. On August 1 and August 2, 2023, respectively, the O'Dell and Delman actions were voluntarily dismissed following the publication of additional disclosures by the Company. The Company believes that the putative class action lawsuit filed on July 27, 2023 and the Merger Lawsuits are without merit and intends to defend vigorously against the allegations made by the respective plaintiffs; however, the Company cannot predict the amount of time and expense that will be required to resolve the complaints. In addition, the outcome of such litigation or any other litigation is necessarily uncertain. ----- The Company is presently unable to predict the duration, scope, or result of the putative class action lawsuit filed on July 27, 2023 or the Merger Lawsuits, or any other related lawsuit. As such, the Company is presently unable to develop a reasonable estimate of a possible loss or range of losses, if any, related to these matters. The Company could be forced to expend significant resources in the defense of these lawsuits or future ones, and it may not prevail. As such, these matters could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, annual, or interim results of operations, cash flows, or its financial condition. The Company is not aware of the filing of other lawsuits challenging the Merger or the related Proxy Statement; however, additional lawsuits arising out of the Merger or the Proxy Statement may be filed in the future, which could prevent or delay completion of the Merger and result in substantial costs to the Company, including any costs associated with indemnification. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,344

Revenue is recognized over time using an input measure of progress. The input measure reflects costs (including investigator payments and pass-through costs) incurred to date relative to total estimated costs to complete (“cost-to-cost measure of progress”). Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress methodology, revenue is recorded proportionally to costs incurred. Contract costs principally include direct labor, investigator payments, and pass-through costs. The accounting for these contracts involves judgment, particularly as it relates to estimating total contract costs based on the scope of work, the complexity of the clinical trial services, the geographical locations involved, industry information, and historical experience, among other factors. Given the judgments necessary to estimate total contract costs in order to estimate the amount of revenue to recognize for certain long-term clinical research contracts, which use the cost-to-cost method, auditing such estimates required extensive audit effort due to the complexity of these contracts and a high degree of auditor judgment when performing audit procedures and evaluating the results of those procedures. _How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit_ Our audit procedures related to management’s estimates of total contract costs to determine the amount of revenue to recognize for full-service clinical research contracts included the following, among others: - We tested the effectiveness of controls over long-term contract revenue, including those over the estimates of total contract costs related to the performance obligation. - We selected a sample of long-term contracts and performed the following: ----- Evaluated whether the contracts were properly included in management’s calculation of long-term contract revenue based on the terms and conditions of each contract, including whether continuous transfer of control to the customer occurred as progress was made toward fulfilling the performance obligation. Compared the transaction prices to the consideration expected to be received based on current rights and obligations under the contracts and any contract modifications that were agreed upon with the customers. Evaluated management’s identification of distinct performance obligations by assessing whether the underlying services were highly interdependent and interrelated. Tested the accuracy and completeness of the total contract costs incurred to date for the performance obligation. Evaluated the estimates of total contract cost for the performance obligation by: - Evaluating management’s ability to achieve the estimates of total contract cost by performing corroborating inquiries with the Company’s project managers and project financial analysts and comparing the estimates to management’s work plans and cost estimates. - Comparing management’s estimates of cost and revenue for the selected contracts to historical experience and evaluating the reasonableness of management’s forecast of remaining costs to be incurred for each contract based on progress to date. Tested the mathematical accuracy of management’s calculation of revenue for the performance obligation. - We evaluated management’s ability to accurately estimate total contract costs and revenue by comparing actual costs to management’s historical estimates for performance obligations that have been fulfilled.",N/A,as_expected,2023,344

During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company performed a quantitative analysis for its Communications reporting unit, which had a goodwill balance of $529.1 million as of December 31, 2022. The Company estimated the fair value of its Communications reporting unit using the income approach. This approach incorporated a discounted cash flow model in which the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit were discounted using a risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital. The determination of fair value for the Communications reporting unit required management to make significant judgments and estimates that are subject to uncertainty as actual results could be different than those judgments and estimates used in the impairment test, which may result in an impairment charge in the future. The Company concluded that the estimated fair value of its Communications reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately $19.0 million, or 3%, and therefore no impairment existed. We identified the quantitative analysis of the Communications reporting unit as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments made by management to estimate its fair value. Auditing the discounted cash flow calculations for this reporting unit involved a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased effort, which included the involvement of our fair value specialists, as it related to evaluating management’s assumptions and estimates related to future growth rates, margin projections, timing of future cash flows and the discount rate. _How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit_ Our audit procedures related to the assumptions and estimates of future growth rates, margin projections, timing of future cash flows and the discount rate used by management to estimate the fair value of the Communications reporting unit included the following, among others: - We tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s goodwill impairment analysis, including those over the selection of the discount rate and management’s development of forecasts of future growth rates, timing of cash flows and margin projections. - We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s forecasts by comparing the forecasts to (1) historical forecasts and the associated actual results, (2) internal communications to management, and (3) forecasted information included in analyst and industry reports for the Company and certain of its peer companies. - With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated (1) the valuation methodology used and (2) the projections of future growth rates and the discount rate by testing the underlying source information including the mathematical accuracy of the calculations, and by developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the rate selected by management. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Raleigh, North Carolina February 15, 2023 We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2016. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,344

A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Raleigh, North Carolina February 15, 2023 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,344

Fair value measurements are classified according to the lowest level input or value-driver that is significant to the valuation. In accordance with this guidance, fair value measurements are classified under the following hierarchy: Level 1 – Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments; Level 2 – Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs or significant value-drivers are observable in active markets; and Level 3 – Model-derived valuations in which one or more significant inputs or significant value-drivers are unobservable, including internally developed models.",N/A,as_expected,2023,344

Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies",333.16.12,Derivative Financial Instruments,"_Interest Rate Swaps_ The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage exposure to variable interest rates on its debt obligations. The Company designates its interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges because they are executed to hedge the Company’s exposure to the variability in expected future cash flows that are attributable to changes in interest rates. Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value and recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in prepaid expenses and other current assets, other long-term assets, accrued expenses, and other long-term liabilities, as disclosed in “Note 5 – Derivatives.” The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined using the market standard methodology of discounted future variable cash receipts. The variable cash receipts are determined by discounting the future expected cash receipts that would occur if variable interest ----- rates rise above the fixed rate of the swaps. The variable interest rates used in the calculation of projected receipts on the swap are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves and volatilities. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments are recorded each period according to the determination of the derivative’s effectiveness. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized as non-operating income or expense immediately when incurred and included in interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. _Foreign Exchange Forward_ From time to time, the Company utilizes a foreign exchange forward in order to minimize monthly foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses on non-functional currency monetary balances. The Company did not designate the derivative as a hedge. All changes in the fair value of the foreign exchange forward are recorded in earnings every month to other expense (income), net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income, as disclosed in “Note 5 – Derivatives.”",N/A,as_expected,2023,344

In evaluating whether it has the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Company assesses whether they have the right to direct the use of the identified asset and to obtain substantially all of the economic benefit from the use of the identified asset. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset during the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Most leases include one or more options to renew. The exercise of the renewal option is at the Company’s sole discretion and the Company includes these options in determining the lease term used to establish its right-of-use assets and lease liabilities when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise its option. ----- Because most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The Company uses the implicit rate when readily determinable. Operating lease expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for as a single lease component. Leases with a lease term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. The Company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease payment amounts that cannot be determined at the commencement of the lease, such as increases in lease payments based on changes in index rates, are not included in the right-of-use assets or liabilities. These variable lease payments are expensed as incurred. The Company on a periodic basis evaluates events or changes in circumstances, such as lease abandonment, that would reduce the future cash flows associated with a ROU asset. In the event of lease abandonment, in which the Company commits to no longer use the underlying property subject to a lease for any business purposes, including storage, and does not have the intent or the ability to sublease the property, a loss on abandonment is recognized within restructuring and other costs.",N/A,as_expected,2023,344

Impairment indicators include events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit with assigned goodwill below its carrying amount. The Company monitors events and changes in circumstances on a continuous basis between annual impairment testing dates to determine if any events or changes in circumstances indicate impairment. Separate intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives or over the period in which economic benefit is received. The Company’s finite-lived intangibles consist of customer relationships, acquired backlog, trade names, trademarks, patient communities, and acquired technologies. All finite-lived intangibles, excluding acquired backlog, are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. Acquired backlog is amortized on an accelerated basis, which coincides with the period of economic benefit received by the Company. The goodwill impairment test involves comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit, including goodwill, to its carrying value using a qualitative or quantitative analysis. If the qualitative analysis indicates that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value for the reporting unit, the Company will perform a quantitative analysis of the reporting unit. If based on the qualitative analysis it is more likely than not that the reporting unit’s estimated fair value exceeds its carrying value, no further analysis is required. If after performing the quantitative analysis it is more likely than not that the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, a non-cash goodwill impairment loss must be recognized in an amount equal to that excess for that reporting unit, not to exceed the total goodwill amount for that reporting unit. The fair value of a reporting unit could be negatively impacted by future events and circumstances. Such events or circumstances include a future decline in the Company’s results of operations, a decline in the valuation of biopharmaceutical company stocks, an increase in weighted-average cost of capital, a significant slowdown in the worldwide economy, failure to meet the performance projections included in the Company’s forecasts of future operating results, loss of key customers, and a reduction in research and development (“R&D”) spending or outsourcing by biopharmaceutical companies, among other events and circumstances. When performing the quantitative analysis, the Company estimates the fair value of each reporting unit using the income approach. This approach incorporates a discounted cash flow model in which the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit are discounted using a risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital. The forecasts used in the discounted cash flow model for each reporting unit are based in part on strategic plans and represent the Company’s estimates based on current and forecasted business and market conditions. The determination of fair value for each reporting unit requires significant judgments and estimates and actual results could be materially different than those judgments and estimates, which may result in a non-cash impairment charge. The Company completed an annual impairment test as of October 1, 2022 for all four of its reporting units, and concluded that there were no impairments. The Company performed a quantitative analysis for its Communications reporting unit, which had a goodwill balance of $529.1 million as of December 31, 2022. The Company concluded that the estimated fair value of its Communications reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately $19.0 million, or 3%, and therefore no impairment existed. The Company reviews intangible assets at the end of each reporting period to determine if facts and circumstances indicate that the useful life is shorter than originally estimated or that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. If such facts and circumstances exist, the Company assesses the recoverability of identified assets by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets to their respective carrying amounts. Impairments, if any, are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets and occur in the period in which the impairment determination is made. The weighted average estimated useful lives of the Company’s intangible assets were as follows as of December 31: **2022** **2021** Customer relationships 9.8 years 9.8 years Acquired backlog 2.6 years 2.6 years Trade names and trademarks 5.5 years 5.5 years Patient communities 6.0 years 6.0 years Acquired technologies 5.8 years 6.0 years No intangible asset impairment charges were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2022 or 2021.

The Company evaluates the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of all legal and regulatory matters and records accruals for probable loss contingencies for which the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Gain contingencies are not recognized until realized. Legal fees are expensed as incurred. Because these matters are inherently unpredictable, and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur, assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. These judgments and estimates are based, among other factors, on the status of the proceedings, the merits of the Company’s defenses, and the consultation with in-house and external counsel. The Company regularly reviews contingencies to determine whether its accruals and related disclosures are adequate.

The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for these services. A performance obligation is a promise (or a combination of promises) in a contract to transfer distinct goods or services to a customer and is the unit of accounting under ASC 606 for the purposes of revenue recognition. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation and is recognized as revenue, when, or as, each performance obligation is satisfied. The majority of the Company’s Clinical Solutions segment contracts have a single performance obligation because the promise to transfer individual services is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts, and therefore, is not distinct. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the contract’s transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation using the best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. The majority of the Company’s revenue arrangements are service contracts that range in duration from a few months to several years. Substantially all of the Company’s performance obligations, and associated revenue, are transferred to the customer over time. The Company generally receives compensation based on measuring progress toward completion using anticipated project budgets for direct labor and prices for each service offering. The Company is also reimbursed for certain third-party pass-through and out-of-pocket costs. In addition, in certain instances a customer contract may include forms of variable consideration such as incentive fees, volume rebates or other provisions that can increase or decrease the transaction price. This variable consideration is generally awarded upon achievement of certain performance metrics, program milestones or cost targets. For the purposes of revenue recognition, variable consideration is assessed on a contract-by-contract basis and the amount included in the transaction price is estimated based on the Company’s anticipated performance and consideration of all information that is reasonably available. Variable consideration is recognized as revenue if and when it is deemed probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved in the future. Most of the Company’s contracts can be terminated by the customer without cause with a notice period that generally ranges from 30 to 90 days. In the event of termination, the Company’s contracts generally provide that the customer pay the Company for: (i) fees earned through the termination date; (ii) fees and expenses for winding down the project, which include both fees incurred and actual expenses; (iii) non-cancellable expenditures; and (iv) in some cases, a fee to cover a portion of the remaining professional fees on the project. The Company’s long-term clinical trial contracts contain implied substantive termination penalties because of the significant wind-down cost of terminating a clinical trial. These provisions for termination penalties result in these types of contracts being treated as long-term for revenue recognition purposes. Changes in the scope of work are common, especially under long-term contracts, and generally result in a change in the total contract transaction price. If the customer does not agree to a contract modification, the Company could bear the risk of cost overruns. Most of the Company’s contract modifications are for services that are not distinct from the services under the existing contract due to the significant integration service provided in the context of the contract and therefore result in a cumulative catch-up adjustment to revenue at the date of contract modification. _Capitalized Costs_ The Company capitalizes certain costs associated with commissions and bonuses paid to its employees in the Clinical Solutions segment because these costs are incurred in obtaining contracts that have a term greater than one year. Capitalized costs are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other long-term assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company amortizes these costs in a manner that is consistent with the pattern of revenue recognition described below. The Company expenses costs to obtain contracts that have a term of less than one year. _Clinical Solutions_ The Company’s Clinical Solutions segment provides solutions to address the clinical development needs of customers. The Company provides total biopharmaceutical program development through its full-service platform, while also providing discrete services for any part of a clinical trial, primarily through functional service provider, Early Stage, and Real World and Late Phase (“RWLP”) services. The services provided via the fullservice platform and RWLP platforms generally span several years and a significant benefit to the customer is provided by integrating the services provided by the Company’s employees as well as those performed by third parties. Because the Company’s full-service platform provides a significant integration service to the customer, these contracts contain a single performance obligation. Revenue is recognized over time using an input measure of progress. The input measure reflects costs (including investigator payments and pass-through costs) incurred to date relative to total ----- estimated costs to complete (“cost-to-cost measure of progress”). Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress methodology, revenue is recorded proportionally to costs incurred. Contract costs principally include direct labor, investigator payments, and pass-through costs. The estimate of total estimated costs at completion requires significant judgment. Contract estimates are based on various assumptions to project future outcomes of events that often span several years. These estimates are reviewed periodically and any adjustments are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period they become known. The remaining service offerings within the Clinical Solutions segment are generally short-term, month-to-month contracts, time and materials basis contracts, or provide a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer (“series”). As such, revenue for these service offerings is generally recognized as services are performed for the amount the Company estimates it is entitled to for the period. _Commercial Solutions_ The Company’s Commercial Solutions segment provides a broad suite of complementary commercialization services including Deployment Solutions, communications (advertising and public relations), and consulting services. Deployment Solutions contracts offer outsourced services to promote commercial products on behalf of a customer. The remaining Commercial Solutions contracts are generally short-term, month-to-month contracts or time and materials contracts. As such, Commercial Solutions revenue is generally recognized as services are performed for the amount of consideration the Company estimates it is entitled to for the period. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time based on the proportion of labor costs expended to total labor costs expected to complete the contract.",N/A,as_expected,2023,344

Unbilled accounts receivable arise when services have been rendered for which revenue has been recognized but the customers have not been billed.

Unbilled services include contract assets, under which the right to bill the customer is subject to factors other than the passage of time. These amounts may not exceed their net realizable value. Contract assets are generally classified as current. Deferred revenue is a contract liability that consists of customer payments received in advance of performance and billings in excess of revenue recognized, net of revenue recognized from the balance at the beginning of the period. _Timing of Billing and Performance_ Differences in the timing of revenue recognition and associated billings and cash collections result in recording of billed accounts receivable, unbilled accounts receivable (including contract assets), and deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet. Amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms either at periodic intervals or upon achievement of contractual milestones. Billings generally occur subsequent to revenue recognition, resulting in recording unbilled accounts receivable in instances where the right to bill is contingent solely on the passage of time (e.g., in the following month), and contract assets in instances where the right to bill is associated with achievement of a milestone.",N/A,as_expected,2023,344

The Company’s subsidiaries in international jurisdictions file tax returns in their respective jurisdictions. The Company estimates its tax liability based on current tax laws in the statutory jurisdictions in which it operates. Accordingly, the impact of changes in income tax laws on deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities is recognized in earnings in the period during which such changes are enacted. The Company records deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and tax basis of the Company’s assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the differences are realized or settled. Deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company evaluates recoverability of these future tax deductions. The Company establishes a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets when the Company believes it is more likely than not the assets will not be realized. The Company evaluates the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing future expected taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, the Company considers both positive and negative evidence, such as historical and forecasted results of operations, and implementation of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. If the objectively verifiable negative evidence outweighs any available positive evidence (or the only available positive is subjective and cannot be verified), then a valuation allowance will likely be deemed necessary. If a valuation allowance is deemed to be unnecessary, such allowance is released and any related benefit is recognized in the period of the change. The Company recognizes a tax benefit from any uncertain tax positions only if they are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position. The Company evaluates uncertain tax positions pursuant to the more likely than not standard, and benefits related to such uncertain tax positions are recognized as the largest amount of benefit, determined on a cumulative probability basis, to be realized upon ultimate settlement of the position. Components of the reserve for uncertain tax positions are classified as either a current or a longterm liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets based on management’s expectation of future cash settlements. Judgment is required in determining what constitutes an uncertain tax position, as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position. The Company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating tax positions and tax benefits. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in domestic and foreign jurisdictions. If the calculation of the liability related to uncertain tax positions proves to be more or less than the ultimate settlement, a tax expense or tax benefit, respectively, would result.

On December 5, 2019, the Board increased the dollar amount authorized under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program to up to an aggregate of $300.0 million and extended the term of the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program to December 31, 2020. The 2018 Stock Repurchase Program expired on December 31, 2020. On November 17, 2020, the Company’s Board authorized the repurchase of up to an aggregate of $300.0 million of the Company’s Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, to be executed from time to time in open market transactions effected through a broker at prevailing market prices, in block trades, or through privately negotiated transactions through December 31, 2022 (the “2021 Stock Repurchase Program”). The 2021 Stock Repurchase Program took effect on January 1, 2021. On May 25, 2022, the Board approved a new stock repurchase program (the “2022 Stock Repurchase Program”) that took effect immediately and replaced the 2021 Stock Repurchase Program. The 2022 Stock Repurchase Program authorizes the Company to repurchase up to $350.0 million of the Company’s Class A common stock, par value $0.01, and will expire on December 31, 2024. The 2022 Stock Repurchase Program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any particular amount of the Company’s common stock, and may be modified, extended, suspended, or discontinued at any time. The timing and amount of repurchases are determined by the Company’s management based on a variety of factors such as the market price of the Company’s common stock, the Company’s corporate cash requirements, and overall market conditions. The 2022 Stock Repurchase Program is subject to applicable legal requirements, including federal and state securities laws and applicable Nasdaq rules. The Company may also repurchase shares of its common stock pursuant to a trading plan meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which would permit shares of the Company’s common stock to be repurchased when the Company might otherwise be precluded from doing so by law. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased 1,928,923 shares of its Class A common stock for a total purchase price of $150.0 million under the 2021 Stock Repurchase Program. No shares were repurchased under the 2022 Stock Repurchase Program. The Company immediately retired all of the repurchased common stock and charged the par value of the shares to common stock. The excess of the repurchase price over the par value was applied on a pro rata basis against additional paid-in capital, with the remainder applied to accumulated deficit.

These carryforwards begin to expire in 2029, but the Company anticipates utilizing such carryforwards prior to their expirations. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had state NOL carryforwards of approximately $717.8 million and $840.4 million, respectively, a portion of which expire annually. The Company also had foreign NOL carryforwards of $122.0 million and $98.9 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The majority of these carryforwards have indefinite carryforward periods, but valuation allowances have been established for jurisdictions where the future benefits of the NOL carryforwards are not more likely than not to be realized. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had Canadian R&D credit carryforwards of $54.6 million and $56.1 million, respectively. These credit carryforwards have an indefinite life, but for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, valuation allowances of $54.6 million and $56.1 million, respectively, have been established against these tax credits where the future benefits of the credits are not more likely than not to be realized. The Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits, exclusive of associated interest and penalties, were $16.8 million and $12.1 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase of $4.7 million was primarily due to increase in positions relating to prior years in both domestic and foreign jurisdictions. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions of $2.5 million and $2.4 million, respectively. The Company believes it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by approximately $1.9 million within the next 12 months as a result of lapses in statutes of limitations. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding accrued interest and penalties, is as follows (in thousands): Unrecognized tax benefits balance as of December 31, 2019** $ 23,238 Increases for tax positions in the current year 254 Increases for tax positions of prior years 3,237 Decreases for tax positions in prior year (2,540) Impact of foreign currency translation 132 Lapse of statute limitations (15,288) Unrecognized tax benefits balance as of December 31, 2020** 9,033 Increases for tax positions in the current year 386 Increases for tax positions of prior years 4,233 Settlements with tax authorities (1,131) Impact of foreign currency translation (169) Lapse of statute limitations (234) Unrecognized tax benefits balance as of December 31, 2021** 12,118 Increases for tax positions in the current year 601 Increases for tax positions of prior years 5,145 Impact of foreign currency translation (565) Lapse of statute limitations (515) Unrecognized tax benefits balance as of December 31, 2022** $ 16,784 Due to the geographic breadth of the Company’s operations, numerous tax audits may be ongoing throughout the world at any point in time. Income tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional income taxes which will be due upon the conclusion of these audits. Estimates of these income tax liabilities are made based upon prior experience and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances. However, due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities which could be materially different from these estimates. In such an event, the Company will record additional income tax expense or benefit in the period in which such resolution occurs. The Company is not currently under any U.S. federal income tax audits, however, income tax returns are under examination by tax authorities in several state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s federal and state tax filings are open to investigations in numerous years due to NOL carryforwards. Additionally, the Company currently has an ongoing examination for tax years 2014 to 2020 in the United Kingdom (“UK”). The UK ----- is the jurisdiction with the Company’s largest foreign operations. The Company believes that its reserve for uncertain tax positions is adequate to cover existing risks or exposures related to all open tax years and jurisdictions.

Commercial Solutions provides the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and healthcare industries with commercialization services, including deployment solutions, communications solutions (public relations, advertising, and medical communications), and consulting services.

The Company’s cash and cash equivalents consist principally of cash and are maintained at several financial institutions with reputable credit ratings. The Company maintains cash depository accounts with several financial institutions worldwide and is exposed to credit risk related to the potential inability to access liquidity in financial institutions where its cash and cash equivalents are concentrated. The Company has not historically incurred any losses with respect to these balances and believes that they bear minimal credit risk.

Commitments and Contingencies,333.72.1,Legal Contingencies,"The Company is involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company accrues a liability when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a material loss contingency is reasonably possible but not probable, the Company does not record a liability, but instead discloses the nature and the amount of the claim, and an estimate of the loss or range of loss, if such an estimate can be made. Legal fees are expensed as incurred. In the opinion of management, the outcome of any existing claims and legal or regulatory proceedings, other than the specific matters described below, if decided adversely, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. On December 1, 2017, the first of two virtually identical actions alleging federal securities law claims was filed against the Company and certain of its officers on behalf of a putative class of its shareholders. The first action, captioned Bermudez v. INC Research, Inc., et al, No. 17-09457 (S.D.N.Y.), was filed in the Southern District of New York (the “Bermudez action”), and the second action, Vaitkuvienë v. Syneos Health, Inc., et al, No. 18-0029 (E.D.N.C.), was filed on January 25, 2018 in the Eastern District of North Carolina (the “Vaitkuvienë action”). On March 30, 2018, the Bermudez action was dismissed voluntarily. After the San Antonio Fire & Police Pension Fund and El Paso Firemen & Policemen’s Pension Fund were appointed as Lead Plaintiffs in the Vaitkuvienë action, Lead Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on July 30, 2018, which named as defendants the Company, Alistair Macdonald, Gregory S. Rush, Michael A. Bell, and each member of the Company’s Board at the time of the stockholder vote on the 2017 merger (the “Merger”) of INC Research with an affiliate of inVentiv Health, Inc. (“inVentiv”). The amended complaint alleged claims under Sections 10(b), 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of a putative class of purchasers of the Company’s common stock between May 10, 2017 and November 8, 2017, contending that the Company published inaccurate or incomplete information regarding, among other things, the financial performance and business outlook for inVentiv’s business prior to and following the Merger. Lead Plaintiffs seek, among other things, orders (i) declaring that the lawsuit is a proper class action and (ii) awarding compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial, including interest thereon, and reasonable costs and expenses incurred in this action, including attorneys’ fees and expert fees, to Lead Plaintiffs and other class members. On September 20, 2018, Defendants moved to dismiss the action. On August 30, 2021, the District Court entered an order granting the motion to dismiss in its entirety, and on October 21, 2021, the Court entered judgment for Defendants. On November 19, 2021, Lead Plaintiffs appealed from this judgment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which appeal remains pending. The Company is presently unable to predict the duration, scope, or result of the foregoing putative class actions, or any other related lawsuit. As such, the Company is presently unable to develop a reasonable estimate of a possible loss or range of losses, if any, related to these matters. While the Company intends to defend any further proceedings in the putative class action litigation vigorously, the outcome of such litigation or any other litigation is necessarily uncertain. The Company could be forced to expend significant resources in the defense of these lawsuits or future ones, and it may not prevail. As such, these matters could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, annual, or interim results of operations, cash flows, or its financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2023,344

No further awards can be issued under the 2014 Plan or 2010 Plan. The 2018 Plan became effective on May 24, 2018, and permits granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), or stock awards to employees, as well as non-employee directors, consultants, or other personal service providers. The terms of share-based instruments granted are determined at the time of grant and are typically subject to such conditions as continued employment, passage of time, and/or satisfaction of performance criteria. The Company has granted stock options and time-vesting RSUs, which typically vest ratably over a two- or three-year period from the grant date. In addition, the Company has granted performance-vesting RSUs. The Board and the Compensation and Management Development Committee have the discretion to determine different vesting schedules. Stock options have a maximum term of ten years. The exercise price per share of stock options may not be less than the fair market value of a share of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant.

The PRSUs are subject to the Company’s achieving certain performance targets including revenue, Clinical Solutions segment’s net new business awards, adjusted diluted EPS, and return on invested capital (“ROIC”). Compensation expense related to PRSUs is recorded based on the estimated quantity of awards that are expected to vest. At each reporting period, management re-assesses the probability that the performance conditions will be achieved and adjusts compensation expense to reflect any changes in the estimated probability of vesting until the actual level of achievement of the performance targets is known. A portion of certain of the Company’s performance-based restricted stock units (“PRSUs”) that are granted to certain executive officers are subject to the Company’s achievement of a specified ROIC. The Company did not meet the minimum threshold for vesting for the tranche of the PRSUs granted in 2019 associated with ROIC.

The Company’s finance leases are related to vehicles that the Company leases for certain sales representatives in its Commercial Solutions segment. The Company’s leases have remaining lease terms of less than one year to 10 years, some of which include options to extend the term or terminate the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the fixed lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. The ROU assets also include any initial direct costs incurred and lease payments made at or before the commencement date, and are reduced by lease incentives. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate to determine the present value of the lease payments for leases that do not have a readily determinable implicit discount rate. The Company’s incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that it would have to borrow on a collateralized basis ----- over a similar term and amount in a similar economic environment. The Company determines the incremental borrowing rates for its leases by adjusting the local risk free interest rate with a credit risk premium corresponding to the Company’s credit rating. The Company records rent expense for its operating leases on a straight-line basis from the lease commencement date until the end of the lease term. The Company records finance lease cost as a combination of the amortization expense for the ROU assets and interest expense for the outstanding lease liabilities using the discount rate discussed above. Variable lease payments for operating leases are related to office facilities and include but are not limited to common area maintenance, parking, electricity, and management fees. The variable lease payments for finance leases are related to maintenance programs for leased vehicles.
