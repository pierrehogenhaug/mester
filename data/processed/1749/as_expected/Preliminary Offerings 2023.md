**Star Parent, Inc.**
to be the parent of Syneos Health, Inc.
$1,700,000,000 % Senior Secured Notes due 2030
________________
Star Parent, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Issuer”), is offering $1,700,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its      % Senior Secured
Notes due 2030 (the “Notes”). The Issuer is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Star Intermediate Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Holdings”),
controlled, directly or indirectly, by Elliott Investment Management L.P., Patient Square Capital, LP and Veritas Capital Fund Management, L.L.C. and/or
their respective affiliates (including, in each case, controlled affiliates and controlled investment funds) (collectively, the “Sponsors”). The Notes are
being issued in connection with an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated May 10, 2023 (as it may be amended from time to time, the “Merger
Agreement”), by and among Syneos Health, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company” or “Syneos Health”), the Issuer, and a direct wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Issuer, Star Merger Sub Inc. (“Merger Sub”). The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into Syneos Health (the “Merger”), with Syneos Health continuing as the
surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Issuer.

This offering may be consummated prior to the consummation of the Merger. Unless the Merger will be consummated on the closing date of
this offering, the Issuer will on the closing date of this offering deposit, or cause to be deposited, the gross proceeds from the sale of the Notes (the
“Escrowed Property”) into a segregated escrow account (the “Escrow Account”) for the benefit of Citibank, N.A., as trustee (in such capacity, the
“Trustee”), and the holders of the Notes, pending the consummation of the Merger, and the Notes will be secured by a first-priority security interest in the
Escrow Account and all deposits and investment property therein. The release of the Escrowed Property, if applicable, will be subject to the satisfaction
of certain conditions, including the consummation of the Merger (the “Escrow Release Conditions”). See “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds;
Special Mandatory Redemption.” The date on which the Escrowed Property is released is referred to as the “Escrow Release Date.”

If the Merger is not consummated on or prior to November 17, 2023 (the “Escrow Outside Date”) and we notify the Trustee and the Escrow
Agent (as defined herein) in writing that the Merger Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms or upon the occurrence of certain other
events, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption. The special mandatory redemption price will be equal to 100% of the initial issue
price of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, from the issue date of the Notes, or a later date to which interest has been paid, if any, up to,
but not including, the date of such special mandatory redemption (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Price”). Additional cash in respect of interest that
would accrue on the Notes from and after the issue date of the Notes will not be pre-funded into the Escrow Account on the issue date of the Notes, but
the Sponsors (directly or through one or more of their affiliates) will commit on or prior to the date of the consummation of this offering, in the event of a
special mandatory redemption, to fund the difference between the amounts in the Escrow Account that are available to be applied to redeem the Notes
pursuant to the special mandatory redemption and the Special Mandatory Redemption Price plus the fees and expenses of the Trustee, the Notes
Collateral Agent (as defined herein) and the Escrow Agent (such amount, the “Shortfall Redemption Amount”). See “Description of the Notes—Escrow of
Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS**

This offering circular has been prepared by us solely for use in connection with the proposed offering of the
Notes described herein to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A and to
persons outside the United States under Regulation S. This offering circular is confidential and personal to each
offeree and does not constitute an offer to any other person or the public generally to subscribe for or otherwise


-----

acquire the Notes. Distribution of this offering circular to any person other than the offeree and those persons, if any,
retained to advise such offeree with respect to this offering circular is unauthorized and any disclosure of any of its
contents without our prior written consent is prohibited. By accepting delivery of this offering circular, you agree to
the foregoing and not to make any photocopies, in whole or in part, of this offering circular or any documents
delivered in connection with this offering circular.

The initial purchasers make no representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or
completeness of the information contained in this offering circular, and nothing contained in this offering circular is,
nor should you rely upon it as, a promise or representation, whether as to the past or the future.

The information contained in this offering circular is as of the date of this offering circular and is subject to
change, completion or amendment without notice. Neither the delivery of this offering circular at any time nor the
offer, sale or delivery of any Note shall, under any circumstances, create any implication that there has been no
change in the information contained in this offering circular or in our affairs since the date of this offering circular.

No person is authorized in connection with this offering to give any information or to make any
representation not contained in this offering circular, and, if given or made, such other information or representation
must not be relied upon as having been authorized by the Issuer, the guarantors or the initial purchasers or any of the
Issuer’s, the guarantors’ or the initial purchasers’ respective representatives. The Issuer and the guarantors do not,
and initial purchasers and their affiliates and agents do not, take any responsibility for, and can provide no assurance
as to the reliability of, any information that others may provide to you.

**Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) nor any state securities commission**
**nor any other regulatory authority has approved or disapproved of these securities or determined if this**
**offering circular is truthful or complete. The foregoing authorities have not confirmed the accuracy or**
**determined the adequacy of this document. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense. There**
**are no registration rights associated with the Notes or the related guarantees.**

We are making this offering in reliance on an exemption from registration under the Securities Act for
offers and sales of securities that do not involve a public offering. The Notes may not be offered or sold except
pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act
and any applicable state securities laws. Laws in certain jurisdictions may restrict the distribution of this offering
circular and the offer and sale of the Notes. Persons into whose possession this offering circular or any of the Notes
are delivered must inform themselves about, and observe, those restrictions. You must comply with all applicable
laws and regulations in force in any applicable jurisdiction, and you must obtain any consent, approval or permission
required for the purchase, offer or sale by you of the Notes under the laws and regulations in force in the jurisdiction
to which you are subject or in which you make such purchase, offer or sale, and neither we nor the initial purchasers
will have any responsibility therefor.

The Notes are subject to restrictions on transferability and resale and may not be transferred or resold
except as permitted under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws pursuant to registration or
exemption therefrom. As a prospective purchaser, you should be aware that you may be required to bear the
financial risks of this investment for an indefinite period of time. See “Plan of Distribution” and “Transfer
Restrictions.” By purchasing the Notes, you will be deemed to have made acknowledgments, representations,
warranties and agreements as set forth under “Transfer Restrictions” in this offering circular. We are not, and the
initial purchasers are not, making an offer to sell the Notes in any jurisdiction except where an offer or sale is
permitted.

The offering is being made on the basis of this offering circular and is subject to the terms described in this
offering circular and the indenture relating to the Notes. In making an investment decision, prospective investors
must rely on their own examination of the Issuer and the terms of the offering, including the merits and risks
involved. Prospective investors should not construe anything in this offering circular as legal, business or tax advice.
Each prospective investor should consult its own advisors as needed to make its investment decision and to
determine whether it is legally permitted to purchase the securities under applicable legal investment or similar laws
or regulations.


-----

We do not intend to apply for listing of the Notes on any securities exchange or for inclusion of the Notes
in any automated dealer quotation system. The Notes will initially be available in book-entry form only. We expect
that the Notes will be issued in the form of one or more registered global notes. The global notes will be deposited
with the registrar, as custodian for DTC as depositary, and registered in the name of Cede & Co. or another nominee
of such depositary. Beneficial interests in the global notes will be shown on, and transfers of beneficial interests in
the global notes will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC and its participants. After the initial
issuance of the global notes, certificated notes will be issued in exchange for global notes only in the limited
circumstances set forth in the indenture that will govern the Notes. See “Book Entry, Delivery and Form.”

The Issuer reserves the right to withdraw this offering of Notes at any time and the Issuer and the initial
purchasers reserve the right to reject any commitment to subscribe for the Notes, in whole or in part. The Issuer and
the initial purchasers also reserve the right to allot to you less than the full amount of Notes sought by you. The
initial purchasers and certain related entities may acquire for their own account a portion of the Notes.

In connection with this offering, the initial purchasers may purchase and sell Notes in the open market.
These transactions may include over allotment, covering transactions and stabilizing transactions. Any of these
transactions may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the marker prices of the Notes. They may
also cause the price of the Notes to be higher than the price that otherwise would exist in the open market in the
absence of these transactions. The initial purchasers may conduct these transactions in the over-the-counter market
or otherwise. If the initial purchasers commence any of these transactions, they may discontinue them at any time.
See “Plan of Distribution.”

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about , 2023, which
will be the     business day following the date of pricing of the Notes (such settlement cycle being herein referred
to as “T+     “). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required
to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly,
purchasers who wish to trade the Notes prior to the date that is two business days preceding the settlement date will
be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will settle T+    , to specify an alternate settlement cycle
at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of Notes who wish to trade the Notes during
such period should consult their own advisor.

This offering circular contains summaries believed to be accurate with respect to certain documents, but
reference is made to the actual documents for complete information. All of those summaries are qualified in their
entirety by this reference. Copies of documents referred to herein will be made available to prospective investors
upon request to the Issuer or the initial purchasers.

Certain monetary amounts, percentages and other figures included in this offering circular have been
subject to rounding adjustments. Accordingly, figures shown as totals in certain tables or charts may not be the
arithmetic aggregation of the figures that precede them, and figures expressed as percentages in the text may not
total 100% or, as applicable, when aggregated may not be the arithmetic aggregation of the percentages that precede
them.

By accepting delivery of this offering circular, you agree to the foregoing and acknowledge that (1) you
have been afforded an opportunity to request and to review all additional information considered by you to be
necessary to verify the accuracy of, or to supplement, the information contained in this offering circular, (2) you
have not relied on the initial purchasers or any person affiliated with the initial purchasers in connection with the
investigation of the accuracy of such information or your investment decision, (3) this offering circular relates to an
offering that is exempt from registration under the Securities Act and (4) no person has been authorized to give
information or to make any representations concerning us, this offering or the Notes described in this offering
circular, other than as contained in this offering circular.

This offering circular may not be copied or reproduced in whole or in part and it may only be distributed
and disclosed to the prospective investors to whom it is provided. You may not disclose any of the contents of this
offering circular or use any information herein for any purpose other than considering the purchase of the Notes.


-----

You should contact the initial purchasers with any questions about this offering or if you require additional
information to verify the information contained in this offering circular.

**NO REVIEW BY THE SEC; NO REGISTRATION RIGHTS**

This offering circular, as well as any other documents in connection with this offering, will not be reviewed
by the SEC. There are no registration rights associated with the Notes or the guarantees, and we have no present
intention to offer to exchange the Notes and the guarantees for the Notes and guarantees registered under the
Securities Act or to file a registration statement with respect to the Notes. The indenture that will govern the Notes
will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the “Trust Indenture Act”). Certain of the
information included in this offering circular does not conform to information that would be required if this offering
was made pursuant to a registration statement filed with the SEC.

**USE OF UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

This offering circular contains unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information for the
Issuer, in order to give effect to the Transactions, which has been derived from the historical financial statements of
Syneos Health included in this offering circular. The assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments are
described in the notes accompanying the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information
included elsewhere in this offering circular and should be read together with the unaudited pro forma condensed
consolidated financial information.

The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information has been prepared on a basis that is
generally consistent with Article 11 of Regulation S-X but does not comply with all requirements of the SEC that
would apply in a public filing with the SEC.

The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information gives effect to the Transactions as if
they had occurred on (i) June 30, 2023, for purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance


-----

sheet, and (ii) January 1, 2022 for the purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of
operations for the year ended December 31, 2022, the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 and the twelve
months ended June 30, 2023.

The historical financial statements of Syneos Health have been adjusted in the unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial information included elsewhere in this offering circular to give effect to pro forma
events that are transaction accounting adjustments, which is necessary to account for the Transactions and the
issuance of the Notes offerred hereby in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States of America (“GAAP”). The unaudited pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and
certain assumptions that Syneos Health’s management believes are reasonable. We have not made any adjustments
in the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information to reflect any expected cost savings arising
from the Transactions.

The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information has been prepared using the
acquisition method of accounting under the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting
Standard Codification Topic 805, Business Combinations. The purchase price will be allocated to the assets acquired
and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date with the exception of
contract assets and liabilities, which are recognized in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts
_with Customers; any excess value of the consideration transferred over the net assets will be recognized as goodwill._
Syneos Health has made a preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed
as of the acquisition date based on management’s preliminary estimates of the fair value of tangible and intangible
assets acquired and liabilities assumed using information currently available, such as comparable industry
transactions.

Differences between these preliminary estimates and the final acquisition accounting will occur and these
differences could have a material impact on the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
information and Syneos Health’s future results of operations and financial position.

The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information has been prepared by our
management team for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the consolidated financial
position or results of operations that would have been realized had the Transactions and the issuance of the Notes
occurred on the dates indicated, nor is it meant to be indicative of any future consolidated financial position or future
results of operations that Syneos Health will experience. The pro forma adjustments are based on the preliminary
assumptions and information available that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The actual
results of Syneos Health may differ significantly from those reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed
consolidated financial information. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information has no
impact on Syneos Health’s previously reported consolidated balance sheets or statements of operations, cash flows
or equity. See “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated and Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated
Financial Information.”

In this offering circular, references to financial or other data presented as “pro forma” or “on a pro forma
basis” refer to a presentation that applies adjustments to give pro forma effect to the Transactions.

**NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES**

This offering circular includes certain supplemental financial measures of our performance that have not
been calculated in accordance with GAAP, including, for example, net revenue, adjusted net income, Reported

-----

investigational site recruitment, clinical monitoring, technology-enabled patient recruitment and engagement, clinical
home health services, clinical trial diversity and biometrics, all across a wide range of therapeutic areas (“TAs”). Our
Commercial Solutions segment offers solutions including field team deployment and communications and full-service
integrated offerings to the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and healthcare industries. Together, our services cover the
entire spectrum of clinical development and marketing and related support, from early-stage clinical development
through FDA approval and ultimately commercialization. We believe this collaboration across the development and
commercialization continuum facilitates unique insights impacting patient populations, therapeutic environments,
product launch timelines, and the competitive landscape.

**_Clinical Solutions_** _(76% of 2022 Revenue)_

Our extensive range of clinical solutions supports the entire clinical development process from Phase I to Phase IV.
We have strengths in complex TAs such as central nervous system (“CNS”), cell and gene therapy, infectious disease
and vaccines, immunology, inflammation and oncology, with the latter representing the largest and fastest growing
TA. Our solutions can be delivered on a full-service project basis, on a functional service basis, or through a hybrid
approach depending on the needs of our customers. Our Clinical Solutions segment had average annual net revenue
growth of 8% from 2019 to 2022.

Our suite of clinical development services includes the following, among others:

Full Service (“FSO”). Our Full-Service clinical development offering (73% of Clinical Solutions 2022 Net Revenue)
provides comprehensive solutions to address the clinical development needs of our customers, focused on Phase IIB
to Phase III clinical trials. FSO clinical study services are highly technical in nature, with multi-year average contract
lengths and high switching costs for customers mid-study. Our full suite of clinical development services includes the
following, among others: patient recruitment and retention, site start-up services, project management, clinical
monitoring, decentralized solutions (e.g., remote engagement and mobile research nursing clinical trial services), drug
safety and pharmacovigilance, quality assurance, regulatory and medical writing, clinical data management, electronic
data capture, and biostatistics.

2


-----

Functional Service (“FSP”). Our Functional Service Provider offering (19% of Clinical Solutions 2022 Net
Revenue) allows pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical sponsors to outsource specific functional areas of clinical
research and/or selectively augment their internal resources. As part of the FSP delivery method, we provide highly
skilled and technical personnel to build “centers of excellence” within the customer’s organization that provide
functional support for executing clinical trials. Through the FSP model, we can provide customized support to
customers within an individual clinical study, a single function, multiple functions within a single TA, or across a
customer’s entire product portfolio. This business is highly recurring in nature, because our personnel are deeply
embedded in customers’ clinical trial organizations. This integration typically results in the customers staying with
the same FSP service provider for multiple years, with underlying FSP master services agreements (“MSAs”)
typically lasting approximately three years. Historically, our growing FSP business has also helped us win
incremental FSO business over time, particularly with the large pharmaceutical customers that represent a
significant portion of the FSP market.

Early Phase & Other Solutions. Our Early Phase & Other Solutions offerings (8% of Clinical Solutions 2022 Net
Revenue) consist of our Early Phase offering, our Real World Evidence (“RWE”) & Late Phase offering, and our
Clinical Technology & Data businesses.

Our Early Phase offering provides a full range of services for early phase to Phase IIA clinical trials, including
bioanalytical assay development and analysis, targeted translational science offerings, and clinical pharmacology
services, including modeling and simulation. We also provide validation and sample analysis services from preclinical development through post-marketing support and purpose-built early phase biometrics support. We have
robust expertise with an array of investigational products, including those of biological origin and with multiple
delivery methods. We collaborate with leading hospitals for the conduct of early development and clinical
pharmacology studies that require access to patients. We have a large base of available subjects, including patient
populations with specific medical conditions and healthy volunteers, which provides efficient and rapid patient
recruitment. Our Early Phase services require sites and staff that are specifically set up and trained for early stage
trials.

Our Other Solutions include our Real World Evidence (“RWE”) and Late Phase businesses that provide outsourced,
long-term longitudinal studies focused on tracking the health impact of medicines in patient populations. Our
Technology & Data business, which launched and ramped up in 2021, includes predictive analytics and AI-based
applications that facilitate pharmaceutical customers’ trial processes (e.g. country and site selection, patient
recruitment and enrollment, and site activation).

The TAs that we cover include CNS, oncology, general medicine, cardiovascular and metabolic, and respiratory,
among others. CNS and oncology made up approximately 50% of Clinical Solutions net revenue in 2022. Within
CNS, our specialties include analgesia, neurology, psychiatry, clinical surveillance, and training. Within oncology,
our offerings extend from preclinical and translational science to clinical development, regulatory, and
commercialization/marketing capabilities. We have extensive experience across a range of cancer therapies ranging
from targeted, to immuno-oncology, to novel and emerging treatments.

**_Commercial Solutions_** _(24% of 2022 Revenue)_

Our Commercial Solutions segment provides a broad suite of complementary commercialization services including
field team deployment solutions, communications services (advertising, public relations, and medical
communications), and consulting services. Additionally, these capabilities provide behavioral and patient insights that
allow us to design smarter clinical trials and accelerate patient recruitment in our Clinical Solutions segment. Our
Commercial Solutions segment had average annual net revenue growth of 4% from 2019 to 2022.

These services are enhanced by Kinetic, our modern customer engagement capability. We use an intelligent and dataenabled approach to digitally enhance our commercialization services by understanding the audiences for our
customers’ products, synchronizing their experiences across multiple personal and digital channels, and decoding the
performance of these interactions to adapt in real-time.

Deployment Solutions. Our Deployment Solutions offering (66% of Commercial Solutions 2022 Net Revenue)
embeds experienced, highly specialized sales talent at the pharmaceutical company customer to educate physicians
and customers, and to bring products to market. Services include contract-based field sales and market access
solutions, medical education, inside sales and contact center solutions, insight and strategy design, patient support
services, training, and talent sourcing. Our field promotion teams also can be supported by our communications and
consulting services. Contracts typically last 1 to 3 years with high renewal rates, creating consistent and visible
revenue.

Public Relations / Medical Communications. Our Public Relations and Medical Communications offering (15% of
Commercial Solutions 2022 Net Revenue) includes highly technical and industry-specific public relations and medical
affairs services, focused on framing a product proposition or strategy through the media and to key stakeholders. These
services are deployed throughout a product’s existence, beginning well before commercial launch, encompassing
regulatory approval and market introduction, and continuing through the life of a product.

Advertising. Our Advertising business (10% of Commercial Solutions 2022 Net Revenue) includes technical, digital
and creative services focused on crafting tailored and targeted advertising campaigns. Services include launching
brands, creating videos and campaigns, digital marketing and others. These services are scalable, as we can support
product commercialization both domestically and internationally.

Consulting Services. Our Consulting Services business (9% of Commercial Solutions 2022 Net Revenue) supports
critical decision points during a pharmaceutical product’s lifecycle, from licensing, to product and portfolio strategy
development, to drug commercialization. These services are centered on maximizing the commercial value of a
client’s product pipeline, helping clinical leaders better deploy strategic resources, improving efficiency, and
enhancing the effectiveness of marketing and sales activities. Our consulting capabilities include the following:
commercial strategy development and planning; pricing and market access; medical affairs advisory; quality
management and regulatory compliance advisory; and risk and program management.

**Our Business Strategy**

Our goal is to be the partner of choice to the pharmaceutical industry by translating our unique clinical and commercial
insights into superior customer outcomes. We believe our ability to strategically integrate clinical development,
medical affairs, and commercial capabilities is unique, allowing for clinical insights to inform commercialization and
for commercial insights to improve clinical trial design and execution. The key elements of our business strategy
include:

**_Bringing differentiated solutions to the market that accelerate customer outcomes. We believe we are uniquely_**
positioned to address our customers’ evolving needs as a leading fully integrated pharmaceutical solutions
organization. We translate unique clinical, medical affairs and commercial insights into outcomes to address modern
market realities. Our breadth of services enables us to provide customized solutions designed to successfully accelerate
the time to market for our customers’ clinical and commercial projects. We believe sharing commercial insights during
the early phases of clinical trials can lead to better informed decisions around clinical trial design and strategies.
Similarly, we believe our therapeutic and clinical trial expertise can lead to improved decisions about regulatory and
payer approvals, market access, reimbursement and formulary inclusion, field team development, and other steps that
are critical to the commercial success of our customers.

**_Further penetrating the large pharmaceutical market. We believe one of the largest opportunities to increase our_**
market share and improve our market position is to further penetrate large pharmaceutical companies. Large
pharmaceutical companies have increasingly focused on partnering with larger outsourcing vendors that offer a full
suite of service capabilities. We have made great progress in increasing wallet share amongst large pharmaceutical
customers by both winning new FSP business as well as entering new FSO preferred partnerships. We expect to
continue to grow market share in this segment, and have invested in expanding our global scale, breadth of services,
and infrastructure to build up our service capabilities for this customer sector.

4


-----

**_Continuing our expansion in the small and mid-sized (“SMID”) market. We believe there is opportunity to grow in_**
the SMID market segment. SMID is a growing market and we are particularly well-positioned given our legacy of
being a trusted clinical and commercialization partner to SMID customers. Our 2020 acquisition of Synteract further
enhanced our position for serving SMID and biotech customers, diversifying our customer base and expanding support
to emerging pharmaceutical companies. We aim to leverage our full suite of clinical and commercialization services,
our Syneos One® solutions, and our therapeutic expertise and organizational alignment down to the Clinical Research
Associate (“CRA”) level, as well as our Trusted Process® operating model to further penetrate the SMID market.

**_Capitalizing on industry trends favoring outsourcing. We believe our Clinical Solutions and Commercial Solutions_**
segments can benefit from growth in pharmaceutical spending coupled with increasing penetration of outsourcing to
deliver attractive growth rates over the long term. Higher costs and increasing complexity of clinical trials are driving
our customers to seek efficiency and expertise through outsourcing services. We believe outsourcing both clinical
development and commercialization services optimizes returns on invested research and development (“R&D”) for
pharmaceutical companies.

**_Strengthening our geographic footprint._** We have developed a global platform with a presence in the major
pharmaceutical markets and intend to further expand our business outside of the United States, targeting regions where
we are underpenetrated and that offer significant growth opportunities. We have added geographic reach through both
acquisitions and organic growth in Asia-Pacific, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, and Europe. We believe
these regions are critical to obtaining business awards from large and mid-sized pharmaceutical companies as trials
become increasingly complex and global. Through our business transformation initiatives, we plan to progress to a
more country-based business delivery model.

**_Accelerate enterprise growth through our Syneos One® offering. Syneos One provides an integrated cross-_**
functional team to provide multiple solutions to the client, including full service clinical development, medical strategy
and risk management and commercialization capabilities. We believe our Syneos One® solutions are uniquely
positioned to determine the appropriate mix of clinical and commercial services to help customers optimize the
development process of their assets and maximize the return on their investment.

**_Transforming our organization to improve customer engagement, increase innovation, and achieve operating_**
**_efficiencies. We are pursuing transformation initiatives that are designed to enhance customer engagement and_**
revitalize innovation and insights throughout our operations. We are focused on innovation that integrates artificial
intelligence and predictive analytics to drive faster data insights and patient outcomes. Leveraging tools and
automation will help us simplify processes and improve real-time visibility, optimize our operational footprint, and
streamline the organization and outsourcing where we believe appropriate. We also seek to improve our productivity,
flexibility, quality, functionality, and cost savings by investing in the development and implementation of global
platforms and integration of our business processes and functions to achieve economies of scale.

**Key Strengths**

**_Large, Growing and Resilient CRO and CCO Markets. We cater to large, addressable markets, with the contract_**
research organization (“CRO”) market estimated at approximately $40 billion and the contract commercialization
organization (“CCO”) market at approximately $30 billion. Moreover, both these markets have recorded consistent
historical growth, with high-single-digit compound annual growth rates (“CAGRs”) in customer spend over the past
10+ years. The CRO market in particular has demonstrated historical resiliency across market cycles, growing each
year during the period from 2005 through 2022. These markets are expected to continue to steadily grow at mid-tohigh single digit CAGRs through 2027, driven by growth in biopharma research and development and sales and
marketing spend and coupled with continued outsourcing penetration, which are in turn driven by underlying demand
for pharmaceuticals, increasingly complex clinical trials, and expanding regulatory requirements.

**_Provider of Mission-Critical Solutions to Biopharma Industry. Through our expertise and service offerings we assist_**
pharmaceutical and biotech companies in the development and ultimate commercialization of the products that are
core to their long-term growth. The cost of drug development is high and continues to grow due to the increasing
complexity and duration of trials, and pharmaceutical companies are generally willing to pay a premium to CROs that
can provide speed and certainty of execution given the mission-critical nature of the clinical development services
provided and the high cost of failure for customers.

5


-----

**_Scaled Service Offering Enabling us to Address Evolving Customer Demands. As one of the largest global CROs,_**
our large employee base, expertise in running large clinical trials and broad geographic footprint position us for growth
in an industry where scale matters. For pharmaceutical and biotech customers, scale, headcount and ability to run
complex and global clinical trials are key purchasing criteria when selecting service providers. The increasing
complexity and global nature of clinical trials have enabled large global CROs to continue to gain share relative to
mid-sized players. As the fourth largest CRO and one of only six CROs with the capabilities, scale and experience to
perform large clinical trials we believe we are well positioned to continue to grow in the global CRO market.

**_Multi-Year Agreements with Customers Provide High Degree of Revenue Visibility. Due to the nature of the services_**
we provide we typically enter into multi-year contracts with our customers that provide us with a high degree of
revenue visibility. Given the critical nature of the services that we provide and the long-term nature of clinical
development trials our FSO customers typically face high switching costs once they’ve entered into a contract.
Through our FSP model we provide customized support to customers where our personnel are deeply embedded in
customer’s clinical trial organizations, with master service agreements that typically have approximately three years
duration. The long-term nature of our service offerings results in an existing backlog that provides a high degree of
revenue visibility for the CRO business.

**_Deep Expertise and Differentiated Value Proposition Across Therapeutic Areas and Delivery Models._** We are
differentiated by our significant experience, deep therapeutic knowledge, and ability to manage complex trials,
including in oncology and CNS, which are two of the largest and fastest growing therapeutic areas. Oncology is
Syneos’ largest therapeutic area at 33% of clinical net revenue and is the highest growth therapeutic area for CRO
spend, while CNS is one the fastest growing therapeutic areas due to increased investment from pharmaceutical R&D
spend and biotech funding in the space. Oncology FSO net revenue has grown at a CAGR of approximately 24% from
2019 to 2022, while the overall market grew 10% during this same time period, with recent RFPs and awards
suggesting that CNS is well-positioned to grow. Our net promotor scores (“NPS”) for both Oncology and CNS are
ahead of or in-line with leading players.

We also have a leading position in FSP and were an early entrant in the market. Our portfolio of services is integrated
with many customers’ drug development processes. This allows us to be well positioned to provide customized FSP
solutions to meet customers’ demands. Moreover, FSP delivery as a portion of the outsourcing market is growing,
driven primarily by large pharmaceutical customers who want to maintain oversight and influence over their drug
development pipeline while outsourcing key mission-critical services to CROs. From 2018 to 2021, FSP penetration
of total outsourced clinical trial activities increased from 28% to 41%, representing approximately 13% growth per
year. Over the past three years our FSP business has grown from $344 million of net revenue in 2019 to $522 million
in 2022, representing a 15% CAGR from 2019 to 2022.

**_Clearly Identified and Achievable Cost Savings. Our recent and ongoing investment in operations and organizational_**
realignment is expected to lead to meaningful margin expansion over time, as we increase productivity of key
resources, simplify project teams and management structure and improve processes. We also have other opportunities
for incremental cost savings, including increasing offshoring of non-customer facing clinical operations and back
office resources, potentially implementing a single ERP platform, and other systems and process initiatives. The chart
below shows the Clinical Solutions segment adjusted EBITDA margin (net of unallocated corporate costs, which are
allocated based on segment revenue contribution) relative to our peers as of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.
This gap illustrates the margin opportunity, which we are actively working to achieve.

We are targeting approximately $95 million of actionable cost savings that can be realized within the first three
years post-close of the Transactions. The targeted savings include real estate facility consolidation, headcount
reduction across both finance and human resources, and migrating non-customer facing roles to lower-cost offshore
locations. See “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated and Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated
Financial Information” for additional detail about our planned cost savings and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our
Business—We may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings and expect to incur substantial expenses related to
the Merger, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.”

**_Performance Turnaround Driven by Initiatives that Support Continued Growth. We have made significant progress_**
in undertaking a number of high-impact initiatives that have already resulted in improved business performance and
are expected to lead to continued growth. Following an approximate 40% growth in bookings from 2019 to 2022 as a
result of our leadership in growing segments of the market, our Clinical Solutions business experienced a decline in
performance in the second half of 2022 driven by industry-high turnover and a lack of sufficient investment in our
administrative systems after years of rapid growth. We have since made significant progress to address the
performance challenges the company experienced in 2022.

Across the industry, employee attrition increased through 2020 and 2021 due to a combination of the “Great
Resignation” (the ongoing economic trend where employees voluntarily resigned from their jobs in mass in early
2021, sparked by the COVID pandemic) and cross-competitor recruiting of talent. Syneos experienced above-market
attrition, driven by high utilization, underinvested administrative systems and operational volatility, with an
approximate 95% increase in trailing 6-month voluntary attrition from June 2020 to September 2021. Over the last
18 months we have worked to improve employee engagement and reduce turnover by increasing wages to be in-line
with or above market, centralizing resource management, and focusing on employee satisfaction. As a result, employee
attrition has consistently trended down and has normalized to pre-2020 levels.

To improve our underinvested administrative systems we initiated targeted upgrades of critical operational and backoffice systems, which are already improving workflow, and also took steps to improve customer-facing technology.
This has resulted in recent quarterly results showing indications of significant progress, two indicators of which are
First Site Activation (“FSA”) to target and Last Patient In (“LPI”) to target. FSA are new projects where we had the
first trial active prior to the target start date, and LPI are projects where we met the target date for completion of the
last patient in the trial. Both metrics represent our ability to deliver on customers’ required timelines and are an
important purchasing factor for pharmaceutical companies when choosing a CRO. In the quarter ended June 30, 2023,
our FSA and LPI to target metrics hit their highest levels since 2021, with FSA to target improving by approximately
45% from its trough in the first half of 2022 and LPI to target improving by approximately 50% since the second half
of 2021 which, amongst other key performance indicators, is an indication of the improvements made in our delivery
model.

We have also streamlined operations by reducing business unit siloing, encouraging cross-team collaboration, and
dedicating significant resources to address customer delivery challenges. These actions have also resulted in a projectcentric delivery model focused on operational discipline, appropriate staffing, and trial performance, and have resulted
in improved performance scorecards and new awards.

As a result of our recent operational initiatives, we have seen a consistent improvement in RFP flow and book-to-bill
after a trough in the quarter ended September 30, 2022. Clinical Solutions RFP flow was up approximately 26% in
the quarter ended June 30, 2023 compared to the trough in the quarter ended September 30, 2022. This increase was
driven by strong performance across both Top 50 and SMID customers. Clinical Solutions book-to-bill has also
increased significantly compared to the trough in the quarter ended September 30, 2022, growing for three consecutive
quarters and reaching 0.9x in the quarter ended June 30, 2023. Both RFP flow and awards represent leading indicators
for future revenue growth.

**_Proven Leadership Team Well-Positioned to Drive Value. Our dynamic leadership team brings a diverse skillset to_**
the table alongside decades of industry experience across pharmaceutical outsourcing. The Sponsors have long-term
familiarity with Syneos, and through their prior investments have built deep knowledge of the pharmaceutical sector
and the CRO space specifically. Additionally, the Sponsors have a proven track record for growing scaled healthcare
and services businesses and driving operational improvement in such businesses through a codified, well-proven
“playbook.” Following the close of the Transactions, Colin Shannon, former CEO of PRA Health Sciences, Inc.
(“PRA”) plans to join Syneos as Executive Chairman. PRA was a global CRO that was taken public in 2014 and
acquired by ICON PLC (“ICON”), another global CRO, in 2021 for $12 billion in consideration. Under Shannon’s
leadership, PRA expanded EBITDA margins while consistently achieving above-market revenue growth. During
Shannon’s tenure, PRA grew its enterprise value from approximately $2 billion at the time of its initial public offering
in 2014 to its sale price of approximately $12 billion in 2021. We also recently hired Mike Bonello, former Chief
Financial Officer of PRA, as our Chief Financial Officer.

**Our Industry**

We operate within the CRO and CCO markets, which, as of December 31, 2022 combined represented an
approximately $70 billion addressable market that is expected to grow at approximately 7% per year through 2027.

CROs help pharmaceutical and biotech companies design and execute clinical trials. In addition to recruiting
investigational sites and ultimately patients and managing clinical trial sites, CROs provide a variety of services to
ensure that trial runs efficiently. They provide project and data management, research and regulatory compliance
services, research education, and medical writing, in addition to other services. CROs play a pivotal role in the
pharmaceutical and drug development process, improving speed and certainty of trial outcomes while providing
critical services that assist in the navigation of complex regulatory environments.

CCOs offer a wide array of commercialization services to their customers, typically related to preparing new products
for launch and maximizing sales. Typically, CCOs operate across medical affairs, marketing, market access, and other
commercialization services. Medical affairs teams focus on target customer analysis to find key stakeholders who they
can leverage to make a successful brand. Market access is the practice of making the drug available to patients,
covering the full range from pricing strategy to reimbursement. Other commercialization services typically focus on
back-end regulatory, technical, and operational services.

**_Expected growth of clinical drug development market. Pharmaceutical companies continue to prioritize the_**
outsourcing of clinical trials to CROs like us. Based on industry sources and management estimates, we believe that
the CRO market includes approximately $40 billion of Phase I-IV trial outsourcing spend that is directly addressable
by Syneos’ services; this market is forecasted to grow approximately 7% per year through 2027, driven by increases
in trial volume, complexity, and duration, increases in pricing, R&D budget increases and further outsourcing
penetration.


**CRO Market Over Time ($bn)**


2018 2022 2027E

Global CRO Market Size

CROs have become larger and vastly more diversified across functions and TAs, expanding their addressable market
and backlogs. We expect scaled and global CROs will continue to gain market share, as customers look to expand
their capabilities in fast-growing TAs and run increasingly global trials. Moreover, customers are bolstering their
suite of services beyond traditional clinical capabilities, including post-approval, commercial, informatics, among
other ancillary offerings where outsourced penetration is low, driving greater outsourcing demand.

Key drivers of growth in the CRO industry include growing trial volume driven by increasing pharmaceutical research
and development investment, increasing duration and complexity of clinical trials, increases in pricing, and to a lesser
extent increasing demand for outsourcing.

**_Pharmaceutical R&D Spend Growth. Pharmaceutical R&D spend has grown faster than sales over the last decade_**
and Phase I-IV trial outsourcing spend that is directly addressable by our services is forecasted to grow approximately
7% through 2027. R&D spend from large pharmaceutical companies is expected to be driven by patent cliffs in the
late 2020s, which will necessitate drug discovery R&D. Furthermore, while there is near-term softness expected in

the biotech segment due to a normalization of venture capital funding from 2019-2021 highs, this segment is also
expected to return to growth going forward.

**_Management of increasingly lengthy and complex clinical trials. The pharmaceutical industry operates in an_**
increasingly sophisticated and highly regulated environment and has responded to the demands of novel therapeutics
by adapting efficient drug development processes. Complex clinical trial design expertise has emerged as a significant
competitive advantage for select CROs that have a track record of successfully navigating country-specific regulatory,
clinical trial protocol, and patient enrollment barriers, including sometimes subjective, evolving clinical endpoints.

**_Expected growth of drug commercialization market. Pharmaceutical companies also increasingly outsource critical_**
elements of drug commercialization to CCOs like us. Based on industry sources and management estimates, we
believe that the market for pharmaceutical commercial outsourcing is approximately $30 billion today and is expected
to grow approximately 7% per year through 2027.

CCO growth is expected to be driven by a combination of (i) a growing number of SMIDs and biotech companies,
who are reliant on outsourced commercialization, (ii) increasingly complex therapeutics with ever-growing
development costs that require effective and bespoke go-to-market solutions, with increased demand for field facing
teams that can engage in highly specialized conversations around complex scientific information associated with
innovative therapies, (iii) upcoming patent cliffs in the late-2020s, which will motivate pharmaceutical companies to
invest in new drug development and commercialization, (iv) an increased reliance on CCOs to help navigate drug
pricing in the face of changing regulation, (v) increased expectations for data generation and data driven insights from
pharmaceutical companies, and (vi) an evolving industry landscape illustrated by a shift to more strategic relationships,
particularly where economies of scale can reduce costs.

CCO Spend ($bn) Outsourcing Rate per Annum (% of Addressable S&M Spend)

**_Value proposition of CROs and CCOs is growing, due to the increasing need for and complexity of drug_**
**_development and commercialization. Large pharmaceutical companies are facing growing demands for new_**
products driven by upcoming patent cliffs in the late 2020s and the need for new blockbuster therapeutics to
replenish their pipeline and drive sales growth. At the same time, these companies are experiencing growing demand
for specialty drugs and a complex and evolving regulatory and political landscape, resulting in a more complicated
operating environment. As a result, the ability of pharmaceutical companies to develop blockbuster therapies and
bring them to market quickly is becoming more important.

Against this backdrop, the services that CROs provide, including the ability to run complex trials for the next
generation of specialty pharmaceutical products, and the services that CCOs provide, including the ability to market
new products to as broad of an audience as possible and as early as possible, are growing in importance.

**_Rapid adoption of remote technology-enabled platforms. Accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have_**
observed an increase in the adoption of remote and digital solutions to facilitate continued healthcare delivery to
patients and support to healthcare providers for our customers’ products. Technology and data that help power siteand patient-centric solutions have been on the rise and include risk-based and remote monitoring, home health, and
virtual personal and non-personal outreach to medical facilities and clinics. As a result of this trend, pharmaceutical

10


-----

companies increasingly rely on outsourcing trials from CROs with global reach and advanced technological
capabilities. This includes the implementation of Decentralized Clinical Trials (“DCTs”), where some or all of a
clinical trial’s activities occur at locations other than a traditional clinical trial site, which can include the
participant’s home, a local health care facility, or a nearby lab. DCTs provide value by enabling accelerated patient
access, improved retention, and increased diversity. We have made key acquisitions in the DTC space in recent
years, including Illingworth (DCT) and StudyKIK (recruitment and retention), and have partnered with industry
leaders such as Science 37 and Medable, enabling us to benefit from increased momentum in the space.

**_Market participants. We are the fourth largest CRO globally by revenue. Only the six largest CROs, including_**
IQVIA, ICON, PPD, Syneos, Parexel and Fortrea (f/k/a Covance) have the scale and capabilities necessary to win
strategic partnerships with large pharmaceutical customers. The CCO market is much more fragmented with no
player having greater than 10% market share. Inizio is the largest player with approximately 6%, followed by
Syneos with 4% and Eversana and IQVIA, which each have approximately 3% share. Additional competitors in the
CCO space include Klick Health, Amplity, PMG, and Real Chemistry.

**The Transactions**

As used throughout this offering circular, the term “Transactions” refers to the consummation of the
Merger, the entry into and funding of the New Credit Facilities, the Sponsor Equity Investment, the issuance of the
Notes offered hereby, and, in each case, the application of the proceeds thereof, including the Debt Refinancing.

**_The Merger_**

On May 10, 2023, the Company entered into the Merger Agreement with the Issuer, an affiliated entity of
the Sponsors, and Merger Sub, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Issuer. The Merger Agreement provides that, at
closing (the “Effective Time”), Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as
the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Issuer. At closing, each share of Class A common
stock of the Company (the “Class A Common Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time will be cancelled and extinguished and, except for limited exceptions, automatically converted into the right to
receive $43.00 in cash. If the Merger is consummated, the Company’s shares of Class A common stock will no
longer trade on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC and will be deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the “Exchange Act”). As a result, the Company will become a private company. The consummation of
the Merger is subject to certain customary conditions, including receipt of specified regulatory appraisals. On
August 2, 2023, the Company’s shareholders voted to approve the Merger.

**_The New Credit Facilities_**

Substantially concurrent with the consummation of the Merger, we intend to enter into a credit agreement
with Goldman Sachs Bank USA, as administrative agent and collateral agent, the lenders from time to time party
thereto, the other borrowers and guarantors from time to time party thereto and the other parties from time to time
party thereto (the “New Credit Agreement” and the facilities thereunder, the “New Credit Facilities”), which will
provide for (i) a senior secured first lien term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount equal to $2,000 million
(the “New Term Facility”) and (ii) a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount equal

Substantially concurrent with the consummation of the Merger and the entry into the New Credit
Agreement, the Sponsors, or their respective controlled affiliates or controlled investment funds, will make an
aggregate equity contribution to the Issuer of approximately $3,990 million (the “Sponsor Equity Investment”).

**_Escrow of Proceeds_**

This offering may be consummated prior to the consummation of the Merger. Unless the Merger will be
consummated on the closing date of this offering, the Issuer will, on the closing date of this offering, deposit, or
cause to be deposited, the Escrowed Property into the Escrow Accounts for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders
of the Notes, pending the consummation of the Merger, and the Notes will be secured by a first-priority security
interest in the applicable Escrow Account and all deposits and investment property therein. The release of the
Escrowed Property from the Escrow Accounts, if applicable, will be subject to the satisfaction of the Escrow
Release Conditions. See “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

If the Merger is not consummated on or prior to the Escrow Outside Date and we notify the Trustee and the
Escrow Agent in writing that the Merger Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms or upon the
occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption at the Special
Mandatory Redemption Price. Additional cash in respect of interest that would accrue on the Notes from and after
the issue date of the Notes will not be pre-funded into the Escrow Accounts on the issue date of the Notes, but the
Sponsors (directly or through one or more of their affiliates) will commit on or prior to the date of the
consummation of this offering, in the event of a special mandatory redemption, to fund the Shortfall Redemption
Amount. See “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

**_Use of Proceeds_**

under the New Credit Facilities, the Sponsor Equity Investment and cash on hand, to (i) pay consideration in
connection with the Merger and any other payments contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (ii) pay fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions, (iii) consummate the Debt Refinancing and (iv) otherwise
provide for working capital and general corporate purposes. See “Use of Proceeds.”

thereunder) of the outstanding loans under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated November 4, 2022,
among the Company, certain of its subsidiaries, the lenders party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A., as
administrative agent and collateral agent, and each of the other parties (and as further amended, modified or
otherwise supplemented prior to the Effective Time, the “Existing Credit Agreement”); (ii) redemption in full of the
Company’s 3.625% Senior Notes due 2029 (the “Existing Notes”) issued under the indenture, dated as of November
24, 2020, among the Company, the guarantors party thereto from time to time, and Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association, as trustee (as amended, modified, or otherwise supplemented prior to the Effective Time); and (iii)
repayment in full (and the release of security interests in the assets of the borrower thereunder) of the outstanding
amounts under the Receivables Financing Agreement, dated as of June 29, 2018, among the Company, Syneos
Health Receivables, LLC, as borrower, PNC Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, and the various

Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory
Redemption ..................................................


This offering may be consummated prior to the consummation of
the Merger. Unless the Merger will be consummated on the
closing date of this offering, the Issuer will, on the closing date
of this offering, deposit, or cause to be deposited, the applicable
Escrowed Property into the Escrow Account for the benefit of the
Trustee and the holders of the Notes, pending the consummation
of the Merger, and the Notes will be secured by a first-priority
security interest in the Escrow Account and all deposits and
investment property therein. The release of the Escrowed
Property from the Escrow Account will be subject to satisfaction
of the Escrow Release Conditions. If the Merger is not
consummated on or prior to the Escrow Outside Date and we
notify the Trustee and the Escrow Agent in writing that the
Merger Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its
terms or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the Notes
will be subject to a special mandatory redemption at the Special
Mandatory Redemption Price. Additional cash in respect of
interest that would accrue on the Notes from and after the issue

Special Mandatory Redemption.”


Guarantees ................................................... Prior to the consummation of the Merger and the release of the
Escrowed Property (if applicable), the Notes will be guaranteed
on a senior secured basis only by Holdings and will not be the
beneficiary of any credit support from Syneos Health and its
subsidiaries. From and after the consummation of the Merger and
following the release of the Escrowed Property (if applicable),
the Notes will be, jointly and severally, unconditionally
guaranteed on a senior secured basis by Holdings and each
existing and future wholly-owned subsidiary of the Issuer that
will guarantee the Issuer’s obligations under the New Credit

Facilities. See “Description of the Notes—Guarantees.” See
“Description of the Notes—Limitation on Guarantees.”

Claims of holders of the Notes will be structurally subordinated
to claims of creditors of certain of our subsidiaries that will not
guarantee the Notes, including our foreign subsidiaries. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the
Notes.”

As of and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, on a pro
forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, our nonguarantor subsidiaries generated approximately 32.9% of our
consolidated revenues, generated approximately 33.8% of our
EBITDA, held approximately 19.9% of our consolidated assets
and had no long-term debt outstanding, in each case after
intercompany eliminations.

Ranking ........................................................ Prior to the consummation of the Merger and the release of the
Escrowed Property (if applicable), the Notes will be the Issuer’s
senior secured obligations secured by a first priority security
interest in the applicable escrow account and all deposits and
investment property therein. From and after the consummation of
the Merger and following the release of the Escrowed Property
(if applicable), the Notes and the related guarantees will be the
Issuer’s and the guarantors’ senior secured obligations and will
be:

                     - secured on a first-priority basis by the Collateral on a pari
_passu basis with the New Credit Facilities and all future_
indebtedness of the Issuer and the guarantors secured by a
first-priority lien on the Collateral;

                     - _pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future_
senior indebtedness of the Issuer and the guarantors;

                     - effectively senior to the Issuer’s and the guarantors’
indebtedness that is unsecured or that is secured by junior
liens on the Collateral, in each case, to the extent of the
value of the Collateral;

                     - senior in right of payment to any of the Issuer’s and the
guarantors’ future subordinated indebtedness;

                     - effectively subordinated to any existing or future
indebtedness of the Issuer or any guarantor that is secured
by assets that are not Collateral; and

                     - structurally subordinated to any existing and future
indebtedness and other liabilities of any subsidiary that
does not guarantee the Notes, including our foreign
subsidiaries.

As of June 30, 2023, on a pro forma basis as described under
“Capitalization,” (i) we would have had approximately
$3,700 million of total debt outstanding, all of which would have
been secured by first priority liens on the Collateral, and (ii) we
would have had approximately $485.8 million available for
borrowing under the New Revolving Facility (after taking
account of undrawn letters of credit), subject to customary
conditions. The aggregate amount of undrawn letters of credit is

17


-----

expected to increase after the Effective Time. See “Risk Factors
– Risks related to Our Business – Downgrades of our credit
ratings could adversely affect us.” Any borrowings under the
New Revolving Facility, once made, would constitute senior
secured indebtedness.

As of June 30, 2023, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to
the Transactions, after intercompany eliminations, our nonguarantor subsidiaries would have had no long-term debt
outstanding.

Collateral ..................................................... From and after the consummation of the Merger and following
the release of the Escrowed Property (if applicable), the Notes
and related guarantees will be secured by first-priority liens on
the Collateral, which consists of substantially all of the assets of
the Issuer and guarantors, all of which will also secure the
Issuer’s and the guarantors’ obligations under the New Credit
Facilities, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens as
described herein. The Collateral will exclude certain Excluded
Property (as defined under “Description of the Notes”). See
“Description of the Notes—Security for the Notes.”

Intercreditor Agreement............................... Citibank, N.A., a national banking association organized and
existing under the laws of the United States, acting through its
Agency & Trust business not in its individual capacity but solely
as collateral agent for the Notes (such collateral agent, the “Notes
Collateral Agent” will become a party to an intercreditor
agreement (the “Intercreditor Agreement”) with the collateral
agent under the New Credit Facilities (the “New Credit
Agreement Collateral Agent”), setting forth therein the relative
rights with respect to the Shared Collateral (as defined under
“Description of the Notes”) and covering certain other matters
relating to the administration of security interests. Pursuant to the
Intercreditor Agreement, the New Credit Agreement Collateral
Agent will initially control substantially all matters related to the
Shared Collateral, including with respect to decisions or
enforcement, and may take actions that the holders of the Notes
may disagree with or that may be contrary to the interests of the
holders of the Notes. The Intercreditor Agreement will also
include waivers of certain important rights that holders of
secured debt would otherwise have.

Optional Redemption ................................... The Issuer may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time on or
after     , 2026 at the redemption prices set forth in this
offering circular, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but
excluding, the redemption date. The Issuer may also redeem up
to 40% of the original aggregate principal balance of the Notes
using the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings completed
before     , 2026 at a redemption price equal to      % of
the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. At any time prior
to     , 2026, the Issuer may also redeem some or all of the
Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the
Notes, plus a “make-whole” premium, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.
Furthermore, at any time prior to     , 2026, the Issuer may
redeem up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes
issued under the indenture (including any additional Notes issued

18


-----

under the indenture) during any twelve-month period at a
redemption price of 103% of the aggregate principal amount
thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but
excluding, the redemption date. See “Description of the Notes—
Optional Redemption.”

Change of Control ....................................... If we experience certain kinds of changes of control, we must
offer to purchase the Notes at 101% of the aggregate principal
amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but
excluding, the purchase date. See “Description of the Notes—
Change of Control.”


Mandatory Offer to Repurchase Following
Certain Asset Sales ......................................


If we sell certain assets and do not repay certain debt or reinvest
the proceeds of such sales within certain time periods, we must
offer to repurchase the Notes as described under “Description of
the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets
and Subsidiary Stock.”


Certain Covenants…………………………. The indenture governing the Notes will limit the Issuer’s

activities prior to the release of funds from the Escrow Accounts
to activities ancillary to the Transactions (if applicable). From
and after the consummation of the Merger, the indenture
governing the Notes will contain covenants that limit, among
other things, our ability and the ability of some of our
subsidiaries to:

                     - incur additional indebtedness;

                     - declare or pay dividends, redeem stock or make other
distributions to shareholders;

                     - make investments;

                     - create liens or use assets as security in other transactions;

                     - merge or consolidate, or sell, transfer, lease or dispose of
substantially all of our assets;

                     - enter into certain transactions with affiliates;

                     - sell or transfer certain assets; and

                     - agree to certain restrictions on the ability of restricted
subsidiaries to make payments to the Issuer.

These covenants are subject to a number of important
qualifications and limitations. In addition, so long as the Notes
have an investment grade rating from any two of Standard &
Poor’s Investors Ratings Service, Moody’s Investors Service,
Inc. and Fitch Ratings, Inc. we will not be subject to certain of
the covenants listed above and the guarantees of the Notes will
be released. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants.”


Transfer Restrictions; No Registration
Rights ...........................................................


The Notes and the guarantees have not been and will not be
registered under the Securities Act, any state securities laws or
the securities laws of any other jurisdictions. The Notes may not
be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a
transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the
Securities Act. See “Transfer Restrictions.” The Notes are being
offered and sold only to persons reasonably believed to be

Absence of an Established Market for the
Notes ............................................................


qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A and to certain
non-U.S. persons in transactions outside the United States
pursuant to Regulation S. We do not intend to list the Notes on
any securities exchange. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

The Notes will be a new class of securities for which there is
currently no market. Although the initial purchasers have
informed us that they intend to make a market in the Notes, the
initial purchasers are not obligated to do so and may discontinue
market-making activities at any time without notice.
Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid market for the

**Summary Historical Consolidated and Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information**

The following tables set forth Syneos Health’s summary historical consolidated and the Issuer’s unaudited
pro forma condensed consolidated financial information for the periods and as of the dates indicated.

The following historical and unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information is only a
summary and should be read in conjunction with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations” and Syneos Health’s historical consolidated financial statements and the related notes
included elsewhere in this offering circular, as well as information included under our headings “Cautionary Note
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” “Summary—The Transactions,” “Risk Factors,” “Capitalization” and
“Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information.”

Syneos Health has derived the consolidated statement of income data and statement of cash flows data for
the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 and consolidated balance sheets data as of December 31,
2022 and 2021 from Syneos Health’s audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering
circular. Syneos Health has derived the consolidated statement of income data and statement of cash flows data for
the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 and consolidated balance sheet data as of June 30, 2023 from Syneos
Health’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering circular, which
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring
accruals unless otherwise indicated) that, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the
results for the interim periods presented. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been
prepared on the same basis as the audited condensed consolidated financial statements. Syneos Health’s historical
results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future period. Syneos Health’s historical
consolidated financial statements do not reflect the impact of the Transactions. Syneos Health’s historical
consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with GAAP.

The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations for the twelve months ended June
30, 2023 and the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2023 are presented below
after giving effect to the Transactions as if they had been completed on January 1, 2022 and June 30, 2023,
respectively. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations for the twelve months ended
June 30, 2023 is derived by adding the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations data for
the six months ended June 30, 2023 and the unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of operations data for the
year ended December 31, 2022, and subtracting the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of
operations data for the six months ended June 30, 2022. The unaudited pro forma financial information has been
derived from the financial statements of Syneos Health included in this offering circular after giving pro forma
effect to the Transactions. See “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information” for an
explanation of how this information was derived and for the full unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated
financial information of Syneos Health. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information has
been prepared by our management for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the consolidated
financial position or results of operations that would have been realized had the Merger occurred on the dates
indicated, nor is it meant to be indicative of any future consolidated financial position or future results of operations
that the Issuer will experience. Pro forma adjustments reflected in the pro forma condensed consolidated financial
statements are based on available information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable and
supportable, and do not reflect the cost of any integration activities or benefits from the Merger that may be derived
in future periods. See “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information.”

(1) This is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company defines adjusted net income as net income
excluding amortization; restructuring and other costs; transaction, integration-related, and other expenses; sharebased compensation expense; other income (expense), net; loss on extinguishment of debt; and the income tax effect
of the above adjustments. The below table presents a reconciliation from net income to adjusted net income. For
additional information regarding our use of such non-GAAP financial measures, see “Non-GAAP Financial

**Adjusted net income ..........................** $  218,196 $165,857 $234,156 $488,171 $468,432

(a) Represents the amortization of intangible assets associated with acquired backlog, customer
relationships, trade names and trademarks, intellectual property, patient communities, and
acquired technologies.

(b) Restructuring and other costs consist primarily of termination costs associated with abandonment
and closure of redundant facilities and other lease-related charges and severance costs associated
with reduction/optimization of our workforce as part of our business transformation initiatives.

(c) Represents fees associated with acquisitions, debt placement and refinancings, and other corporate
costs that management believes are not representative of our operating performance, including
one-time costs associated with our business transformation initiatives, the pending Merger,
implementation costs associated with a new enterprise resource planning system, and incremental
costs resulting from the war in Ukraine.

(d) Represents non-cash share-based compensation expense related to awards granted under equity
incentive plans.

(e) Other expense (income), net is comprised primarily of foreign currency exchange gains and losses,
other gains and losses related to investments, and contingent consideration related to divested
businesses.

(f) Loss on extinguishment of debt is associated with debt prepayments and refinancing activities.

(g) Represents the income tax effect of the non-GAAP adjustments made to arrive at adjusted net
income using an estimated effective tax rate of approximately 23.5% for the six months ended
June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022. Represents the income tax effect of the non-GAAP adjustments
made to arrive at adjusted net income using estimated effective tax rates of approximately 23.0%
and 23.5% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. These
rates have been adjusted to exclude tax impacts related to valuation allowances recorded against
deferred tax assets.

(2) Clinical Solutions net new business awards represent new business awards of the Clinical Solutions
segment, net of cancellations and are presented on a trailing twelve month basis. See “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations— New Business Awards and Backlog—Net New
Business Awards.”

-----

(3) Clinical Solutions backlog is presented as of the last day of the period shown and represents
anticipated revenue for work not yet completed or performed under executed contracts and other forms of written
confirmation, where there is sufficient or reasonable certainty about the customer’s availability and intent to fund.
Our backlog also reflects any cancellation or adjustment activity related to these awards. The Company’s backlog
policy is conservative relative to the industry, as the Clinical Solutions awards and backlog policy requires that work
must be expected to begin within six months of the end of the quarter in which the award was recognized in order to
be added to the backlog. FSP awards are only booked on a twelve-month basis. See “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations— New Business Awards and Backlog—Net New
Business Awards.”

(4) Clinical Solutions book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of Clinical Solutions net new business awards for the
relevant period divided by Clinical Solutions revenue for the same period.

(5) This is a non-GAAP financial measure. Reported EBITDA represents earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization. The Company defines Management Adjusted EBITDA as Reported EBITDA,
further adjusted to exclude expenses and transactions that the Company believes are not representative of its core
operations, namely: restructuring and other costs; transaction, integration-related, and other expenses; share-based
compensation expense; and other income (expense), net. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as Management
Adjusted EBITDA, further adjusted to add expenses or exclude gains that the Company believes are not
representative of its normal operations, namely: adding certain bonus costs, excluding certain gains on sales of fleet
vehicles, and accounting for other normalizing adjustments. The Company defines Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as
Adjusted EBITDA, further adjusted to (a) include the full-year run rate benefit of cost savings actions implemented
during the trailing twelve month period and (b) exclude costs that the Company believes can be avoided or reduced
following the Merger, namely: certain public company to private cost savings, operational cost savings, and real
estate cost savings. The Company defines Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
divided by net revenue, expressed as a percentage.

The Company presents Reported EBITDA and Management Adjusted EBITDA because it believes they are useful
metrics for investors as they are commonly used by investors, analysts and debt holders to measure the Company’s
ability to fund capital expenditures and meet working capital requirements. Adjusted net income and Management
Adjusted EBITDA are used by management and the Board to assess the performance of the Company’s business.
The Company presents Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA to present, to the best of its knowledge
and belief, the expected course of action and what Syneos Health believes its financial performance would have
been had certain normalizing adjustments and estimated run-rate cost savings been fully accounted for and
implemented at the start of the applicable period. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We may be
unable to realize anticipated cost savings and expect to incur substantial expenses related to the Merger, which could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.”

The below table reconciles net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to Reported EBITDA,
Management Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, and Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA Margin. For additional information regarding our use of such non-GAAP financial measures, see “NonGAAP Financial Measures.”

(b) Reported EBITDA for historical periods represents EBITDA as we previously reported. Reported
EBITDA for Pro Forma LTM Ended June 30, 2023 represents EBITDA calculated using the same
methodology but with the Pro Forma information found elsewhere in this offering circular. Pro
Forma Reported EBITDA does not add-back approximately $30.7 million of costs described in
note (d) below that represent pro forma Transaction adjustments for the twelve months ended June
30, 2023 as set forth in the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statement of
Operations for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023.

initiatives, implementation costs associated with a new enterprise resource planning system, and
incremental costs resulting from the war in Ukraine.

(e) Represents non-cash share-based compensation expense related to awards granted under equity
incentive plans.

(f) Other expense, net is comprised primarily of foreign currency exchange gains and losses, other
gains and losses related to investments, and contingent consideration related to divested
businesses.

(g) Loss on extinguishment of debt is associated with debt prepayments and refinancing activities.

(h) In 2022 no bonuses were paid that were associated with the annual plan other than clinical
consulting related bonuses. Syneos instituted a new plan in 2023 with specific targeted metrics in
order to receive a pay-out.

(i) Vehicle sales were accelerated in 2022 to take advantage of macro economic supply and demand
factors driving unusually high prices for used vehicles. This adjustment utilized the 2019-2021
average to adjust the 2022 gain to historical levels.

(j) The $44 million of cost savings in the twelve month period ended June 30, 2023 includes realized
real estate cost savings of $17 million in 2023. This $17 million of real estate cost savings
represents a portion of the $95 million of total cost savings targeted as part of the Merger. See
note (k) below for further detail on the $95 million of total targeted cost savings. Also see “Risk
Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings
and expect to incur substantial expenses related to the Merger, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.”

(k) Represents costs associated with being a public reporting company that we will not incur as a
private company.

(l) Represents the remaining portion of the $95 million of cost savings targeted as part of the Merger.
This $95 million of total cost savings is comprised of (i) approximately $28 million of real estate
cost savings from right-sizing, lease expiration and subleasing, (ii) $31 million of finance
organization savings from headcount and total cost reduction, (iii) $18 million of human resource
organization savings through improvements in productivity, and (iv) $17 million of savings
through transitioning non-customer-facing roles to lower-cost locations and automation. For the
twelve month period ended June 30, 2023, approximately $17 million of the $28 million of real
estate cost savings have been achieved, resulting in $78 million of remaining costs savings. See
note (i) above for further detail on the $17 million of real estate cost savings achieved in 2023.
Also see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We may be unable to realize anticipated
cost savings and expect to incur substantial expenses related to the Merger, which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.”

(m) Net revenue is defined as revenue less reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses of $1,544,512.

(6) This is a non-GAAP financial measure. Pro forma first lien net debt is defined as pro forma first lien
debt less pro forma cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash after giving effect to the Transactions. Pro forma first
lien net leverage ratio is defined as pro forma first lien net debt divided by Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for the
twelve months ended June 30, 2023. Pro forma first lien net debt and pro forma first lien net leverage ratio are
commonly used metrics to evaluate and compare leverage between companies and are not presentations made in

**RISK FACTORS**

_Any investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks_
_described below, and all of the information contained in this offering circular before deciding whether to purchase_
_any Notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face._
_Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also_
_materially and adversely affect our business. If any of those risks actually occur, our business, cash flows, financial_
_condition and results of operations would suffer. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements_
_and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. See the_
_“Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in this offering circular._

**Risks Related to Our Business**

**_If we do not generate a sufficient number of new business awards, or if new business awards are delayed,_**
**_terminated, reduced in scope, or fail to go to contract, our business, financial condition, results of operations, or_**
**_cash flows may be materially adversely affected._**

Our business is dependent on our ability to generate new business awards from new and existing customers
and maintain existing customer contracts. Our inability to generate new business awards on a timely basis and
subsequently enter into contracts for such awards could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows. For example, in our Clinical Solutions segment, we have experienced
lower flow of requests for proposals. In the SMID market specifically, we have also experienced delays in award
decisions. For larger pharmaceutical companies specifically, we have started experiencing slower pipelines. These
headwinds have been caused by the current macroeconomic conditions and our ability to win repeat business, among
other factors.

There is risk of cancelability in both the clinical and commercial businesses. The time between when a
clinical study is awarded and when it goes to contract is typically several months and, prior to a new business award
going to contract, our customer can cancel the award without notice. Once an award goes to contract, the majority of
our customers can terminate the contract without cause with a notice period that generally ranges from 30 to 90
days. Our contracts have been and may in the future be delayed or terminated by our customers or reduced in scope
for a variety of reasons, including factors beyond our control, including but not limited to:

    - decisions to forego or terminate a particular trial;

    - budgetary limits or changing priorities;

    - macroeconomic conditions, including but not limited to interest rate increases and inflation;

    - actions by regulatory authorities;

    - production problems resulting in shortages of the candidate drug being tested;

    - failure of products being tested to satisfy safety requirements or efficacy criteria;

    - unexpected or undesired clinical results for products;

    - insufficient patient enrollment in a trial;

    - insufficient principal investigator recruitment;

    - production problems resulting in shortages of the product being tested;

    - the customers’ decision to terminate or scale back the development or commercialization of a product
or to end a particular project;


-----

    - challenges with customer engagement or satisfaction;

    - shift of business to a competitor or internal resources; or

    - product withdrawal following market launch.

Our commercial services contracts typically have a significantly shorter wind down period than clinical
contracts, particularly within our Deployment Solutions offerings. Furthermore, many of our communications
services and consulting services projects are tied to a customer’s annual marketing budget or ad hoc service
requests, which can lead to seasonal variability in revenue and less predictability in future revenues. In addition,
many of our biopharmaceutical Deployment Solutions service contracts provide our customers with the opportunity
to internalize the resources provided under the contract and terminate all or a portion of the services we provide
under the contract. Our customers may also decide to shift their business to a competitor. Each of these factors
results in less visibility to future revenue and may also result in high volatility in future revenue.

Contract terminations, delays and modifications are a regular part of our business across each of our
segments. Our full-service offering within our Clinical Solutions business has been, and may continue to be,
negatively impacted by project delays, which impact near term revenue disproportionately. In addition, project
delays, downsizings and cancellations, particularly within our Deployment Solutions and communications offerings,
which are part of our Commercial Solutions business, have impacted our results in the past and might impact them
in the future. The loss, reduction in scope or delay of a large project or of multiple projects could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, we might not
realize the full benefits of our backlog if our customers cancel, delay, or reduce their commitments to us.

In the event of termination, our contracts often provide for fees for winding down the project, which
include both fees incurred and actual and non-cancellable expenditures and may include a fee to cover a percentage
of the remaining professional fees on the project. These fees might not be sufficient for us to maintain our margins,
and termination may result in lower resource utilization rates and therefore lower operating margins. In addition,
cancellation of a contract or project for the reasons noted above may result in the unwillingness or inability of our
customer to satisfy its existing obligations to us such as payments of accounts receivable, which may in turn result
in a material impact to our results of operations and cash flow. Historically, cancellations and delays have
negatively impacted our operating results, and they might again. In addition, we might not realize the full benefits of
our backlog if our customers cancel, delay, or reduce their commitments to us, which may occur if, among other
things, a customer decides to shift its business to a competitor or revoke our status as a preferred provider. Thus, the
loss or delay of a large business award or the loss or delay of multiple awards could adversely affect our revenues
and profitability. Additionally, a change in the timing of a new business award could affect the period over which
we recognize revenue and reduce our revenue in any one quarter.

**_Our backlog might not be indicative of our future revenues, and we might not realize all of the anticipated future_**
**_revenue reflected in our backlog._**

Our backlog consists of anticipated revenue awarded from contract and pre-contract commitments that are
supported by written communications. Once work begins on a project, revenue is recognized over the duration of
the project, provided the award has gone to contract. Projects may be canceled or delayed by the customer or
delayed by regulatory authorities. To the extent projects are delayed, the timing of our revenue could be adversely
affected. In addition, if a customer terminates a contract, we typically would be entitled to receive payment for all
services performed up to the termination date and subsequent customer-authorized services related to terminating
the canceled project. Typically, however, we have no contractual right to the full amount of the future revenue
reflected in our backlog in the event of a contract termination or subsequent changes in scope that reduce the value
of the contract. The duration of the projects included in our backlog, and the related revenue recognition, typically
range from a few months to several years. Our backlog might not be indicative of our future revenues, and we might
not realize all the anticipated future revenue reflected in that backlog. A number of factors may affect backlog,
including:

    - the size, complexity, and duration of projects or strategic relationships;


-----

    - the cancellation or delay of projects;

    - the failure of one or more business awards to go to contract; and

    - changes in the scope of work during the course of projects.

The rate at which our backlog converts to revenue may vary over time. The revenue recognition on larger,
more global projects could be slower than on smaller, more regional projects for a variety of reasons, including, but
not limited to, an extended period of negotiation between the time the project is awarded to us and the actual
execution of the contract, as well as an increased time frame for obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals. In
addition, we provide certain services to our customers before they pay us. There is a risk that we may initiate a
clinical trial or commercial offering for a customer, and the customer subsequently becomes unwilling or unable to
fund the completion of the services. In such a situation, we may have a risk of non-payment or non-collection on
invoicing. Additionally, notwithstanding the customer’s ability or willingness to pay for or otherwise facilitate the
completion of the services, we may be legally or ethically bound to complete or wind down the services at our own
expense.

Our backlog as of June 30, 2023 was $9.65 billion, a decrease from $11.46 billion as of June 30, 2022. A
decrease in backlog may lead to lower revenue. Although an increase in backlog will generally result in an increase
in revenues over time, an increase in backlog at a particular point in time does not necessarily correspond directly to
an increase in revenues during any particular period, or at all. The extent to which contracts in backlog will result in
revenue depends on many factors, including, but not limited to, delivery against project schedules, scope changes,
customer engagement and satisfaction, contract terminations, and the nature, duration, and complexity of the
contracts, and can vary significantly over time. As described above, we have experienced decreases in backlog over
the past twelve months and therefore expect our revenues to decline (on a period over period basis) during the
remainder of 2023. In the first and second quarters of 2023 we believe we began to experience stabilization, relative
to the prior periods, in the trend reversals with increases in backlog and of the net new business awards which
contribute to backlog.

**_Our operating results have historically fluctuated between fiscal quarters and may continue to fluctuate in the_**
**_future._**

Our operating results have fluctuated in previous quarters and years and may continue to vary significantly
from quarter to quarter and are influenced by a variety of factors, such as:

    - timing of contract amendments for changes in scope that could affect the value of a contract and
potentially impact the amount of net new business awards and revenue from quarter to quarter;

    - commencement, completion, execution, postponement, or termination of large contracts;

    - contract terms for the recognition of revenue milestones;

    - progress of ongoing contracts and retention of customers;

    - timing of and charges associated with completion of acquisitions, integration of acquired businesses,
and other events;

    - changes in the mix of services delivered, both in terms of geography and type of services;

    - potential customer disputes, penalties or other issues that may impact the revenue we are able to
recognize, or the collectability of our related accounts receivable; and

    - exchange rate fluctuations.

Our operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future results.


-----

**_The COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic repercussions have adversely impacted our business and_**
**_results of operations, and other pandemics or outbreaks of disease may do so in the future._**

The COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic repercussions have significantly impacted, and may
continue to impact, our business and our operations. Other pandemics or outbreaks of disease may have similar
impacts in the future. Any ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to adversely impact our
business and results of operations in a number of ways, including but not limited to:

    - delays or difficulties in commencing new and operating ongoing clinical trials:

    - restrictions on the ability of our field teams to visit HCPs and difficulty securing appropriate PPE and
testing and other tools required for client-facing engagements and visits to sites/HCPs;

    - diversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trials, including the diversion of
hospitals serving as our clinical trial sites and hospital staff supporting the conduct of our clinical
trials, as well as the reduction of our customers’ operating budgets;

    - interruption of key clinical trial activities, such as clinical trial site data monitoring, due to social
distancing requirements, quarantine and isolation protocols or interruption of clinical trial subject visits
and study procedures, which may impact the collection and integrity of study data and ability to
measure clinical trial endpoints;

    - business disruptions at our customers;

    - limitations on our employee resources;

    - diversion of management resources; and

    - impacts from prolonged remote work arrangements, such as strains on our business continuity plans,
cybersecurity risks, and inability of certain employees to perform their work remotely.

These and other impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic or other pandemics or outbreaks of disease could also
have the effect of heightening many of the other risk factors included elsewhere in this offering circular. In addition,
the continued prevalence of COVID-19 has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which
increases the cost of, and adversely impacts access to, capital and increases economic uncertainty.

**_Our customer or therapeutic area concentration may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial_**
**_condition, results of operations, or cash flows._**

If any large customer decreases or terminates its relationship with us, our business, financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In particular, our large pharma customer
base is smaller than our peers and the loss of one large pharma customer may have an outsize impact on our results
of operations or cash flows as compared to our peers. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, our top ten
customers, based on revenue, accounted for approximately 39% of our consolidated revenue and our top ten Clinical
Solutions customers, based on backlog, accounted for approximately 39% of our total backlog. No single customer
accounted for greater than 10% of our total consolidated revenue for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 and for
the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. It is possible that an even greater portion of our revenues will
be attributable to a smaller number of customers in the future, including as a result of our entering into strategic
provider relationships with customers. Also, consolidation in our potential customer base results in increased
competition for important market segments and fewer available customer accounts.

A significant concentration of our customers are categorized as SMID companies, which represented
approximately 45% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. Economic conditions that adversely
impact this customer group may have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations or cash flows as
compared to our peers. In particular, a portion of our SMID customer base is pre-revenue companies that do not
generate cash flows from operations and is reliant on outside funding sources, which may be limited in a


-----

recessionary environment. Additionally, conducting multiple clinical trials for different sponsors in a single
therapeutic class involving drugs with the same or similar chemical action may adversely affect our business if some
or all of the trials are canceled because of new scientific information or regulatory judgments that affect the drugs as
a class.

Similarly, marketing and selling products for different sponsors with similar drug action subjects us to risk
if new scientific information or regulatory judgment prejudices the products as a class, leading to compelled or
voluntary prescription limitations or withdrawal of some or all of the products from the market.

**_If we are unable to successfully increase our market share, our ability to grow our business and execute our_**
**_growth strategies could be materially adversely affected._**

A key element of our growth strategy is increasing our market share within the biopharmaceutical services
market, the clinical development market and in the geographic markets in which we operate. In addition, we
continue to invest in expanding new services such as our medical affairs offerings and technology-enabled services.
If we successfully grow our market share within the biopharmaceutical services and clinical development markets
and as we make investments in growing our newer service offerings, we might not have, or adequately build, the
competencies necessary to perform our services satisfactorily or we may face increased competition. If we are
unable to succeed in increasing our market share or realize the benefits of our investments in our new service
offerings, we may be unable to implement this element of our growth strategy and our ability to grow our business
or maintain our operating margins could be adversely affected.

**_If we underprice our contracts, overrun our cost estimates, or fail to receive approval for or experience delays in_**
**_documentation of change orders, our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows may be_**
**_materially adversely affected._**

We price our contracts based on assumptions regarding the scope of work required and the cost to complete
the work. We bear the financial risk if we initially underprice our contracts or otherwise overrun our cost estimates,
which could adversely affect our cash flows and financial performance. In addition, contracts with our customers
are subject to change orders, which occur when the scope of work we perform needs to be modified from that
originally contemplated in our contract with the customers. This can occur, for example, when there is a change in a
key study assumption or parameter or a significant change in timing. We may be unable to successfully negotiate
changes in scope or change orders on a timely basis or at all, which could require us to incur cost outlays ahead of
the receipt of any additional revenue. In addition, under GAAP we cannot recognize additional revenue anticipated
from change orders until appropriate documentation is received by us from the customer authorizing the change.
However, if we incur additional expense in anticipation of receipt of that documentation, we must recognize the
expense as incurred. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows.

**_Our business depends on the continued effectiveness and availability of our information systems, including_**
**_the information systems we use to provide services to our customers and to store employee data, and failures_**
**_of these systems may materially limit our operations or have an adverse effect on our reputation._**

Our information systems consist of systems we have purchased or developed, legacy information systems
from organizations we have acquired and, increasingly, web-enabled and other integrated information systems. In
using these information systems, we frequently rely on third-party vendors to provide hosting and system
management services, where our infrastructure is dependent upon the reliability of their underlying platforms,
facilities, and communications systems. We also utilize integrated information systems that we provide customers
access to or install for our customers in conjunction with our delivery of services.

As the breadth and complexity of our information systems continue to grow, we will increasingly be
exposed to the risks inherent in maintaining the stability of our legacy systems due to prior customization, attrition
of employees or vendors involved in their development, and obsolescence of the underlying technology, as well as
risks from external cybersecurity attacks or data breaches on multi-national companies, usage errors by our
employees, and software bugs. Because certain customers, clinical trials, and other long-term projects depend upon
these legacy systems, we also face an increased level of embedded risk in maintaining the legacy systems and


-----

limited options to mitigate such risk. We are also exposed to risks associated with the availability of all our
information systems, including:

    - disruption, impairment or failure of data centers, telecommunications facilities or other key
infrastructure platforms, including those maintained by our third-party vendors;

    - security breaches of, cyberattacks on, and other failures or malfunctions in our information technology
(“IT”) systems, including our employee data and communications, critical application systems or their
associated hardware, software, and databases;

    - excessive costs, excessive delays, or other deficiencies in systems development and deployment; and

    - potential for encryption based “Ransomware” attacks that could hinder our ability to access our
systems and data until we are able to recover from backups.

In addition to these availability risks, due to the interconnectedness of IT systems across platforms and
hosts, we could see disruptions to our systems as “collateral damage” from attacks targeting our connected partners.

The materialization of any of these risks may impede the processing of data, the delivery of databases and
services, and the day-to-day management of our business and could result in the corruption, loss, or unauthorized
disclosure of proprietary, confidential, or other data. In addition, a security breach could require that we expend
substantial additional resources related to the security of our technical infrastructure, databases, and services,
diverting resources from other projects and disrupting our business. Despite any precautions we take, our IT systems
and those of our third-party vendors, strategic partners, and other contractors are vulnerable to attack, damage, or
interruption from fire, floods, hurricanes, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, break-ins,
hacking, phishing attacks and other social engineering schemes, employee theft or misuse, human error, fraud,
denial or degradation of service attacks, sophisticated nation-state and nation-state-supported actors, or unauthorized
access or use by persons inside our organization, or persons with access to systems inside our organization.

Corruption or loss of data may result in the need to repeat a project at no cost to the customer, but at
significant cost to us, the termination of a contract, civil or criminal enforcement actions and penalties, or damage to
our reputation. Additionally, significant delays in system enhancements or inadequate performance of new or
upgraded systems once completed could damage our reputation and harm our business. Finally, long-term
disruptions in the infrastructure caused by events such as natural disasters, the outbreak of war, the escalation of
hostilities and acts of terrorism, particularly involving cities in which we have offices, and cyberattacks such as
those recently faced by other multi-national companies could adversely affect our businesses. As our business
continues to expand globally, these types of risks may be further increased by instability in the geopolitical climate
of certain regions, underdeveloped and less stable utilities and communications infrastructure, and other local and
regional factors. Although we carry property, cyber incident, and business interruption insurance that we believe is
customary for our industry, our coverage might not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur.

We have been and expect that we will continue to be subject to attempts to gain unauthorized access to or
through our information systems or those we internally or externally develop for our customers. We also rely on
service providers for certain information systems who have experienced attempts to gain such unauthorized access.
In addition, we and our service providers may be susceptible to physical or computer-based attacks by terrorists,
nation states, or hackers due to our role in the biopharmaceutical service industry. Bad actors may be motivated by a
desire to access or steal our or our clients’ intellectual property. These concerns about security are increased when
information is transmitted over the Internet. Increased frequency of remote work may increase the risk of such
attacks. If such attacks are not detected immediately, their effect could be compounded. Even if identified, we may
be unable to adequately investigate or remediate incidents or breaches due to attackers increasingly using tools and
techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, to avoid detection, and to remove or obfuscate forensic
evidence. To date these attacks have not had a significant impact on our operations or financial results. However,
successful attacks in the future could result in negative publicity, significant remediation and recovery costs, legal
liability and damage to our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
operations, and cash flows. We maintain cyber insurance; however, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the
financial, legal, business, or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our systems.


-----

Additionally, we rely on service providers for the timely transmission of information across our global data
network. If a service provider fails to provide the communications capacity or services we require for similar
reasons, the failure could interrupt our services. Because of the centrality of our processing systems to our business,
any interruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of our brands’ reliability and harm our
business. If a service provider experiences the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential data they are
processing on our behalf, whether through systems failure or employee actions, cyberattacks, fraud, or
misappropriation, it could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers. Similarly, such disclosure could
result in negative publicity, significant remediation and recovery costs, legal liability, and damage to our reputation,
and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In
addition, contractual indemnity, the service provider’s liability insurance and our liability insurance might not be
sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyberattacks, and other related
breaches.

**_Our business is subject to international economic, political, and other risks that could have a material adverse_**
**_effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or reputation._**

We have operations in many foreign countries, including, but not limited to, countries in the Asia-Pacific
region, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East and Africa. As of June 30, 2023, approximately 61% of our
workforce was located outside of the U.S., and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, approximately 43% of
our revenue was earned from work performed outside of the U.S. Our international operations are subject to risks
and uncertainties inherent in operating in these regions, including:

    - conducting a single project across multiple countries is complex, and issues in one country, such as a
failure to comply with, or unanticipated changes to, local regulations, or restrictions such as
restrictions on import or export of clinical trial material or availability of clinical trial data may affect
the progress of the clinical trial in the other countries, resulting in delays or potential termination of
contracts, which in turn may result in loss of revenue;

    - the U.S. or other countries could enact legislation or impose regulations or other restrictions, including
unfavorable labor regulations, tax policies, data protection regulations, trade rules and regulations, or
economic sanctions, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct business in or
expatriate profits from the countries in which we operate;

    - the U.S. has previously enacted and it or other countries may in the future enact legislation that limits
or prohibits the use of foreign manufactured equipment or supplies, such as the Uyghur Forced Labor
Prevention Act, which imposes a ban on virtually all imports from the Xinjiang region of China unless
companies are able to prove that the products were not made with forced labor, which could have an
adverse effect on our ability to conduct business;

    - foreign countries are expanding or may expand their banking regulations that govern international
currency transactions, particularly cross-border transfers, which may inhibit our ability to transfer
funds into or within a jurisdiction, impeding our ability to pay our principal investigators, vendors and
employees, thereby impacting our ability to conduct trials in such jurisdictions;

    - foreign countries are expanding or may expand their regulatory framework with respect to patient
informed consent, protection and compensation in clinical trials, or transparency reporting
requirements (similar to the Physician Payments Sunshine Act in the U.S.), which could delay, inhibit
or prohibit our ability to conduct projects in such jurisdictions;

    - the regulatory or judicial authorities of foreign countries might not enforce legal rights and recognize
business procedures in a manner in which we are accustomed or would reasonably expect;

    - changes in political and economic conditions, including the war in Ukraine and political and trade
tensions between the U.S. and China, may lead to changes in the business environment in which we
operate, changes in inflation and foreign currency exchange rates, and delays or disruptions to the


-----

ability to conduct clinical trials or other business, and if such changing political or economic
conditions escalate or spill over to or otherwise impact additional regions, they could heighten many of
the other risk factors included in this offering circular;

    - potential violations of applicable anti-bribery/anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act (“FCPA”) and the UK Bribery Act of 2010, may cause a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or reputation;

    - customers in foreign jurisdictions may have longer payment cycles, and it may be more difficult to
collect receivables in those jurisdictions;

    - natural disasters, pandemics, or international conflict, including terrorist acts, could interrupt our
services, endanger our personnel, or cause project delays or loss of clinical trial materials or results;
and

    - foreign governments may enact currency exchange controls that may limit the ability to fund our
operations or significantly increase the cost of maintaining operations.

For example, the war in Ukraine has not had a material impact on our revenue to date; however, that could
change depending on the magnitude of the conflict and the imposition of additional sanctions by the U.S. and other
countries or the spread of the conflict to surrounding areas. Banking and economic sanctions imposed on Russia
continue to present challenges to clinical trials. We are monitoring these sanctions to ensure we are in compliance
and we are adapting our operations to address both the sanctions and the increasing logistical challenges of
conducting trials in Russia. At this time, we are continuing to service patients in Ukraine and Russia in existing
trials where possible. Any impacts to our revenue are expected to be temporary in nature as we work with customers
to explore alternate sources of recruiting new patients, including potentially activating sites in other regions.

These risks and uncertainties could negatively impact our ability to, among other things, perform large,
global projects for our customers. Furthermore, our ability to deal with these issues could be affected by applicable
U.S. laws. Any such risks could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations,
cash flows, or reputation.

**_Governmental authorities may question our intercompany transfer pricing policies or change their laws in a_**
**_manner that could increase our effective tax rate, prevent us from being able to rely on favorable tax regimes, or_**
**_otherwise harm our business._**

As a U.S. company doing business in international markets through subsidiaries, we are subject to both
U.S. and foreign tax and intercompany pricing laws, including those relating to the flow of funds between legal
entities in various international jurisdictions. Tax authorities in the U.S. and in international markets have the right
to examine our corporate structure and how we account for intercompany transactions. If such authorities challenge
our corporate structure, transfer pricing mechanisms or intercompany transactions and the resulting assessments are
upheld, our operations may be negatively impacted, and our effective tax rate may increase. Tax rates vary from
country to country and if a tax authority determines that our profits in one jurisdiction should be increased, we
might not be able to realize the full tax benefits in the event we cannot utilize all foreign tax credits that are
generated, or we do not realize a compensating offsetting adjustment in another taxing jurisdiction. The effects of
either would increase our effective tax rate. The U.S. or other jurisdictions may also change their tax laws from time
to time, which could cause our effective tax rate to increase or decrease. For example, the U.S. Congress recently
enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which was signed into law by President Biden on August 16, 2022.
Among other things, the Inflation Reduction Act provided funding for increased tax enforcement, imposed a 1%
excise tax on certain share repurchases by publicly traded corporations, and imposed a 15% minimum tax on certain
large corporations. We are unable to predict whether or when any other tax changes will be enacted.

The UK R&D tax relief regime has in recent years been, and continues to be, subject to review and
amendment. On July 21, 2022, draft legislation was published setting out, among other things, details of proposed
restrictions that (if enacted) could limit our ability (except in limited circumstances) to make claims under the
existing relief programs with respect to accounting periods beginning on or after April 1, 2023 for expenditures


-----

incurred on foreign sub-contracted R&D work and externally provided workers that are not paid through UK
payroll. These and other potential future changes to the UK research and development tax relief regime may limit
the extent to which we qualify and can make claims under the regime.

Additionally, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has issued certain guidelines
regarding base erosion and profit shifting. As these guidelines continue to be formally adopted by separate taxing
jurisdictions, we may need to change our approach to intercompany transfer pricing in order to maintain compliance
under the new guidelines. Our effective tax rate may increase or decrease depending on the current location of
global operations at the time of the change. Finally, we might not always be in compliance with all applicable
customs, exchange control, Value Added Tax, and transfer pricing laws despite our efforts to be aware of and to
comply with such laws. If these laws change, we may need to adjust our operating procedures and our business
could be adversely affected.

**_Upgrading the information systems that support our operating processes and evolving the technology platform_**
**_for our services pose risks to our business._**

Continued efficient operation of our business requires that we implement standardized global business
processes and evolve our information systems to enable this implementation, especially in the course of integrating
acquired businesses into our company. We are in the process of upgrading our enterprise resource planning software
globally. Our inability to effectively manage the implementation of new information systems or upgrades and adapt
to new processes designed into these new or upgraded systems in a timely and cost-effective manner may result in
disruption to our business and negatively affect our operations.

We have entered into agreements with certain vendors to provide systems development, integration, and
hosting services that develop or license to us IT platforms and capacity for programs to optimize our business
processes. If such vendors or their products fail to perform as required or if there are substantial delays in
developing, implementing, securing, and updating our IT platforms, our customer delivery may be impaired, and we
may have to make substantial further investments, internally or with third parties, to achieve our objectives. For
example, we rely on an external vendor to provide the clinical trial management software used in managing the
completion of our customer clinical trials. If that externally provided system is not properly maintained, we might
not be able to meet the obligations of our contracts or may need to incur significant costs to replace the system or
capability. Additionally, our progress may be limited by parties with existing or claimed patents who seek to enjoin
us from using preferred technology or seek license payments from us.

Meeting our objectives is dependent on a number of factors which might not take place as we anticipate,
including obtaining adequate technology-enabled services, depending upon our third-party vendors to develop and
enhance existing applications to adequately support our business, creating IT-enabled services that our customers
will find desirable, and implementing our business model with respect to these services. Also, increased IT-related
expenditures and our potential inability to anticipate increases in service costs may negatively impact our business,
financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

**_Failure to meet objectives of our internal business transformation initiatives could adversely impact our_**
**_competitiveness and harm our operating results._**

We are pursuing business transformation and optimization initiatives to improve customer engagement,
increase innovation, and improve operating efficiencies and employee engagement. As part of these initiatives, we
seek to enhance our productivity, flexibility, quality, delivery, and cost savings by investing in the development and
implementation of global platforms and the integration of our business processes and functions to drive economies
of scale, including through the use of business process outsourcing, application and technology development, and
the introduction of optimized business delivery models. These initiatives may not yield their intended gains, or be
completed in a timely manner. This may impact our competitiveness and our ability to meet our growth objectives
and, as a result, could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

**_If we fail to perform our services in accordance with contractual requirements, regulatory requirements, and/or_**
**_ethical considerations, we could be subject to significant costs, liability, or regulatory enforcement actions, and_**
**_our reputation could be harmed._**


-----

We contract with biopharmaceutical companies to perform a wide range of services to assist them in
bringing new drugs, biologics and medical devices to market and to support the commercial activity of products
already in the marketplace. Our services include monitoring clinical trials, data and laboratory analysis, project
management, patient recruitment, safety reporting, product launch consulting, product deployment solutions,
advertising, publications, and medical communications, and other related services. Such services are complex and
subject to contractual requirements, regulatory standards, and ethical considerations. For example, we must adhere
to applicable regulatory requirements such as those required by the FDA, the EMA and the competent authorities of
the member states of the EU, and the MHRA in the UK, including those laws and regulations governing the
promotion, sales, and marketing of biopharmaceutical products, and GCP requirements, which govern, among other
things, the design, conduct, performance, monitoring, auditing, recording, analysis, and reporting of clinical trials.
Once initiated, clinical trials must be conducted pursuant to and in accordance with the applicable investigational
new drug/device application or clinical trial application, the requirements of the relevant institutional review boards
(as defined herein) or ethics committees, and GCP requirements. For studies involving controlled substances, we are
also subject to regulation by the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) which regulates the distribution,
recordkeeping, handling, security, and disposal of controlled substances. If we fail to perform our services in
accordance with applicable requirements, regulatory agencies may take action against us or our customers. Such
actions may include sanctions such as injunctions or refusal of such regulatory authorities to grant marketing
approval of products, imposition of clinical holds or delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, rejection of data
collected in studies, license revocation, product seizures or recalls, operational restrictions, civil or criminal
penalties or prosecutions, damages, or fines. Additionally, there is a risk that actions by regulatory authorities, if
they result in significant inspectional observations or other measures, could harm our reputation and cause
customers not to award us future contracts or to cancel existing contracts. Customers may also bring claims against
us for breach of our contractual obligations, and patients in the clinical trials and patients taking drugs/using devices
approved on the basis of those trials may bring personal injury claims against us. Any such action could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or reputation.

Such consequences could arise if, among other things, the following occur:

_Improper performance of our services. The performance of our clinical development and other biopharmaceutical_
services is complex and time-consuming. For example, we may make mistakes in conducting a clinical trial that
could negatively impact or obviate the usefulness of the clinical trial or cause the results of the clinical trial to be
reported improperly. If the clinical trial results are compromised, we could be subject to significant costs or
liability, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to perform our services and our reputation could be
harmed. For example:

    - significant non-compliance generally could result in the termination of ongoing clinical trials or the
disqualification of data for submission to regulatory authorities;

    - a compromise of patient safety and/or the scientific integrity of the trial could require us to repeat the
clinical trial under the terms of our contract at no further cost to our customer, but at a substantial cost
to us; and

    - a material breach of a contractual term could result in liability for damages or termination of the
contract.

Large clinical trials can cost hundreds of millions of dollars and improper performance of our services could have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition, damage our reputation, and result in the termination of current
contracts or failure to obtain future contracts from the affected customer or other customers.

_Interactive Voice/Web Response Technology malfunction. We develop, maintain, and use third-party computer-_
based interactive voice/web response systems to automatically manage the randomization of patients in a given
clinical trial to different treatment arms and regulate the supply of investigational drugs, all by means of interactive
voice/web response systems. An error in the design, programming, or validation of these systems could lead to
inappropriate assignment or dosing of patients which could give rise to patient safety issues, invalidation of the trial,
or liability claims against us. Furthermore, negative publicity associated with such a malfunction could have an


-----

adverse effect on our business and reputation. Additionally, errors in randomization may require us to repeat the
clinical trial at no further cost to our customer, but at a substantial cost to us.

_Investigation of customers. From time to time, one or more of our customers have been, and may in the future be,_
audited or investigated by regulatory authorities or enforcement agencies with respect to regulatory compliance of
their clinical trials, programs, or the marketing and sale of their drugs. In these situations, we have often provided
services to our customers with respect to the clinical trials, programs, or activities being audited or investigated,
and we are called upon to respond to requests for information by the authorities and agencies. There is a risk that
either our customers or the regulatory authorities could claim that we performed our services improperly or that
we are responsible for clinical trial or program compliance. If our customers or the regulatory authorities make
such claims against us and prove them, we could be subject to damages, fines, or penalties. In addition, negative
publicity regarding regulatory compliance of our customers’ clinical trials, programs, or drugs could have an
adverse effect on our business and reputation.

_Insufficient customer funding to complete services. As noted above, clinical trials can cost hundreds of millions of_
dollars. There is a risk that we may initiate a clinical trial or commercial offering for a customer, and then the
customer becomes unwilling or unable to fund the completion of the service. In such a situation, we may have a risk
of non-payment or non-collection on invoicing. Additionally, notwithstanding the customer’s ability or willingness
to pay for or otherwise facilitate the completion of the service, we may be legally or ethically bound to complete or
wind down the services at our own expense. This risk is heightened in a recessionary or weak funding environment
for our customers, who may be unable to raise or expend funds necessary to complete a trial, and our services may
account for large portions of their budgets. Our SMID customer base, some of which are in pre-revenue operational
positions, may experience heightened exposure during this environment.

In addition to the above U.S. laws and regulations, we must comply with the laws of all countries where we do
business, including laws governing clinical trials in the jurisdiction where the trials are performed. Failure to
comply with applicable requirements could subject us to regulatory risk, liability, and potential costs associated
with redoing the trials, which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results.

**_The operation of our early phase (Phase I and IIA) clinical facilities and the services we provide there as well as_**
**_our clinical trial management, including direct interaction with clinical trial patients or volunteers, and our_**
**_mobile research nursing services, could create potential liability that may adversely affect our business, financial_**
**_condition, results of operations, cash flows, and reputation._**

We operate facilities where early phase clinical trials are conducted, which ordinarily involve testing an
investigational drug on a limited number of individuals to evaluate a product’s safety, determine a safe dosage range
and identify side effects. Additionally, our business involves clinical trial management, which is one of our clinical
development service offerings, and includes the testing of investigational drugs on human volunteers. Some of these
trials involve the administration of investigational drugs to known substance abusers or volunteers and patients that
are already seriously ill and are at risk for further illness or death. Failure to operate any of our early phase facilities
in accordance with applicable regulations could result in that facility being shut down, which could disrupt our
operations and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and reputation.

Additionally, we face risks resulting from the administration of drugs to volunteers, including adverse
events, and the professional malpractice of medical care providers, including improper administration of a drug or
device. We also directly employ doctors, nurses, and other trained employees who assist in implementing the testing
involved in our clinical trials, such as drawing blood from healthy volunteers. Our mobile research nurses engage in
a wide range of services, from observing clinical trial participants ingesting drugs, to administering an infusion of
oncology medicine to a pediatric study participant. Our exposure with respect to these activities could exceed any
contractual limits on indemnification in our contracts with customers and vendors. Any professional malpractice or
negligence by such doctors, nurses, principal investigators, or other employees could potentially result in liability to
us in the event of personal injury to or death of a volunteer in clinical trials. This liability, particularly if it were to
exceed the limits of any indemnification agreements and insurance coverage we may have, may adversely affect our
business and financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and reputation.

**_If we are unable to attract suitable principal investigators and recruit and enroll patients for clinical trials, our_**
**_clinical development business might suffer._**


-----

The recruitment of principal investigators and patients for clinical trials is essential to our business.
Principal investigators are typically located at hospitals, clinics, or other sites and supervise the administration of the
investigational drug to patients during the course of a clinical trial. Patients generally include people from the
communities in which the clinical trials are conducted. Several of our competitors have purchased site networks or
site management organizations as a strategy for priority access to a specific site, which could put us at a competitive
disadvantage. Our clinical development business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract suitable and
willing principal investigators or recruit and enroll patients for clinical trials on a consistent basis. The expanding
global nature of clinical trials increases the risk associated with attracting suitable principal investigators and
patients, especially if these trials are conducted in regions where our resources or experience may be more limited.
For example, if we are unable to engage principal investigators to conduct clinical trials as planned or enroll
sufficient patients in clinical trials, we might need to expend additional funds to obtain access to more principal
investigators and patients than planned or else be compelled to delay or modify the clinical trial plans, which may
result in additional costs to us or cancellation of the clinical trial by our customer. If realized, these risks may also
inhibit our ability to attract new business, particularly in certain regions.

**_Unfavorable economic conditions have had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our_**
**_business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows._**

Unfavorable economic conditions and other adverse macroeconomic factors on global and domestic
markets have, and could in the future result, among other matters, in tightening in the credit and capital markets,
high levels of inflation, low liquidity, and volatility in fixed income, credit, currency, and equity markets. Such
conditions impacted our results during the year ended December 31, 2022 and could continue to negatively impact
our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows in the future. For example, our customers
might not be able to raise money to conduct existing clinical trials, or to fund new drug development and related
future clinical trials, particularly given a portion of our SMID customer base are pre-revenue companies that do not
generate cash flows from operations. Resource-sharing customers may also scale back commercial support for their
products. In addition, economic or market disruptions could negatively impact our vendors, contractors, or principal
investigators which might have a negative effect on our business.

The cost of providing our services has risen in recent years and is likely to continue to rise while inflation
remains elevated. Competition and fixed price contracts may limit our ability to maintain existing operating
margins. Some competitors have greater resources than us to sustain periods of marginally profitable or unprofitable
sales. Costs increasing more rapidly than market prices may reduce profitability and may have a material adverse
impact on our business and results of operations.

**_Our business could result in liability to us if a drug causes harm to a patient. While we are generally indemnified_**
**_and insured against such risks, we may still suffer financial losses._**

When we market drugs under contract for a biopharmaceutical company, we could suffer liability for harm
allegedly caused by those drugs, either as a result of a lawsuit against the biopharmaceutical company to which we
are joined, a lawsuit naming us or any of our subsidiaries, or an action launched by a regulatory body. Any claim
could result in potential liability for us if the claim is outside the scope of the indemnification agreement we have
with the biopharmaceutical company, the biopharmaceutical company does not abide by the indemnification
agreement as required, or the liability exceeds the amount of any applicable indemnification limits or available
insurance coverage. Such a result could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations,
cash flows, and reputation. Furthermore, negative publicity associated with harm caused by drugs we helped to
market could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation.

**_If we lose the services of key personnel or are unable to recruit experienced personnel, our business, financial_**
**_condition, results of operations, cash flows, or reputation could be materially adversely affected._**

Our success substantially depends on the collective performance, contributions, and expertise of our senior
management team and other key personnel including qualified management, professional, scientific, and technical
operating staff, and business development personnel, particularly as we integrate acquired businesses into our
company. There is significant competition for qualified personnel, particularly those with higher educational
degrees, in the biopharmaceutical and related services industries. In the year ended December 31, 2021, and to a
lesser degree in the year ended December 31, 2022, we experienced increased employee turnover and challenges
due to the current industry-wide labor shortage and resulting competition to retain and attract qualified personnel. In


-----

addition, the close proximity of some of our facilities to offices of our major competitors could adversely impact our
ability to successfully recruit and retain key personnel. The departure of any key executive, or our inability to
continue to identify, attract and retain qualified personnel or replace any departed personnel in a timely fashion, has
impacted and may in the future impact our ability to grow our business and compete effectively in our industry and
might negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or reputation.

**_We may outsource certain functions, which would make us more dependent upon third parties and may adversely_**
**_impact our ability to recruit and retain experienced personnel._**

As part of our transformation initiatives, we may in the future outsource certain administrative functions,
including functions related to accounts payable, procurement, human resources operations, data analytics, and
corporate IT, among others. As a result, we would expect to rely on third parties to ensure that our staffing needs are
appropriately met. This reliance would subject us to risks arising from the loss of control over outsourced processes
and functions, changes in pricing that may affect our operating results, and potentially, termination of these services
by our outsourcing suppliers. A failure of service providers to perform services in a satisfactory manner may have a
significant adverse effect on our business operations. These outsourcing and transformation initiatives could result
in potential adverse effects on employee capabilities and our continued ability to recruit, hire, retain, and motivate
highly skilled personnel. Such events may impact our ability to grow our business and compete effectively in our
industry and might negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or
reputation.

**_Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,_**
**_results of operations, and cash flows._**

Approximately 13% of our revenue for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 was denominated in
currencies other than the U.S. dollar and 39% of our direct and operating costs are incurred in countries with
functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Our financial statements are reported in U.S. dollars and changes in
foreign currency exchange rates could significantly affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash
flows. Our primary exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is related to the following risks:

_Foreign Currency Risk from Differences in Customer Contract Currency and Operating Costs Currency. The_
majority of our global contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars or Euros while our operating costs in foreign
countries are denominated in various local currencies. Fluctuations in the exchange rates of the currencies we use to
contract with our customers and the currencies in which we incur cost to fulfill those contracts can have a
significant impact on our results of operations.

_Foreign Currency Translation Risk._ The revenue and expenses of our international operations are generally
denominated in local currencies and translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly,
exchange rate fluctuations between the value of the U.S. dollar versus local currencies will affect the U.S. dollar
value of our foreign currency denominated revenue, costs, and results of operations.

_Foreign Currency Transaction Risk. We earn revenue from our service contracts over a period of several months_
and, in many cases, over several years, resulting in timing differences between the consummation and cash
settlement of a transaction. Accordingly, profitability of the transactions denominated in foreign currencies is
subject to effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during the period of time between the
consummation and cash settlement of a transaction.

We may seek to limit our exposure to these risks through inclusion of foreign currency exchange rate provisions
in our service contracts, and/or by hedging certain exposures with foreign exchange derivative instruments.
These measures, however, might not offset or mitigate any, or all, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable
movements in foreign currency exchange rates.

**_Our effective income tax rate may fluctuate, which may adversely affect our results of operations._**

Our effective income tax rate is influenced by our profitability in the various taxing jurisdictions in which
we operate. Changes in the distribution of profits and losses among taxing jurisdictions may have a significant


-----

impact on our effective income tax rate, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
Factors that may affect our effective income tax rate include, but are not limited to:

    - jurisdictional earnings;

    - the repatriation of foreign earnings to the U.S.;

    - uncertain tax positions;

    - changes in tax laws in various taxing jurisdictions, including interpretations and regulations related to
the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act;

    - audits by taxing authorities;

    - the establishment of valuation allowances against deferred income tax assets if we determine that it is
more likely than not that future income tax benefits will not be realized;

    - the release of a previously established valuation allowances against deferred income tax assets if we
determine that it is more likely than not that future income tax benefits will be realized;

    - changes in the relative mix and size of clinical studies in various tax jurisdictions; and

    - the timing and amount of the vesting and exercising of share-based compensation.

These changes may cause fluctuations in our effective income tax rate that could adversely affect our
results of operations and cause fluctuations in our earnings and earnings per share.

**_We have only a limited ability to protect our intellectual property rights, and these rights are important to our_**
**_success._**

We develop, use, and protect our proprietary methodologies, analytics, systems, technologies, and other
intellectual property. Existing laws of the various countries in which we provide services offer only limited
protection of our intellectual property rights, and the protection in some countries may be very limited. We rely
upon a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality policies, nondisclosure agreements, and other contractual
arrangements, as well as patent, copyright, and trademark laws, to protect our intellectual property rights. These
laws are subject to change at any time and certain agreements might not be fully enforceable, which could further
restrict our ability to protect our innovations. Our intellectual property rights might not prevent competitors from
independently developing services similar to or duplicative of ours or alleging infringement of their intellectual
property rights in certain jurisdictions. The steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter
infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property or claims against us for alleged infringement or
misappropriation by competitors, former employees, or other third parties. Furthermore, we might not be able to
detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights.
Enforcing our rights might also require considerable time, money, and oversight, and we might not be successful in
enforcing our rights.

**_Our acquisition strategy may present additional risks, including the risk that we may be unable to fully realize the_**
**_competitive and operating synergies projected to be achieved through any specific acquisition._**

We have historically grown our business both organically and through acquisitions. We have and will
continue to assess the need and opportunity to offer additional services through acquisitions of other companies.
Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:

    - ability to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or obtain any necessary financing on commercially
acceptable terms;


-----

    - increased risk to our financial position and liquidity through changes to our capital structure and
assumption of acquired liabilities, including any indebtedness incurred to finance the acquisitions and
related interest expense;

    - diversion of management’s attention from normal daily operations of the business;

    - insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions;

    - assumption of liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies, including
liabilities for their failure to comply with healthcare, tax, and other regulations;

    - inability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies and other benefits anticipated to result
from an acquisition;

    - ability to integrate acquired operations, products, and technologies into our business;

    - difficulties retaining and integrating acquired personnel and distinct cultures into our business and
fully leveraging the benefits of such acquisitions; and

    - the potential loss of key employees, customers, or projects.

We may also spend time and money investigating and negotiating with potential acquisition targets but not
complete the transaction. Any acquisition could involve other risks, including, among others, the assumption of
additional liabilities and expenses, difficulties and expenses in connection with integrating and leveraging the
acquired companies and achieving the expected benefits, issuances of potentially dilutive securities or interestbearing debt, loss of key employees of the acquired companies, transaction expenses, diversion of management’s
attention from other business concerns, and, with respect to the acquisition of international companies, the inability
to overcome differences in international business practices, language and customs. Our failure to successfully
integrate potential future acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations, and cash flows.

**_Our relationships with existing or potential customers who are in competition with each other may adversely_**
**_impact the degree to which other customers or potential customers use our services, which may adversely affect_**
**_our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows._**

The biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, with biopharmaceutical companies each seeking to
persuade payers, providers, and patients that their drug therapies are better and more cost-effective than competing
therapies marketed or being developed by competing firms. In addition to the adverse competitive interests that
biopharmaceutical companies have with each other, biopharmaceutical companies also have adverse interests with
respect to drug selection and reimbursement with other participants in the healthcare industry, including payers and
providers. Biopharmaceutical companies also compete to be first to market with new drug therapies. We regularly
provide services to biopharmaceutical companies that compete with each other, and we sometimes provide services
to such customers regarding competing drugs in the market and in development. Our existing or future relationships,
particularly broader strategic provider and commercial relationships, with our biopharmaceutical customers may
therefore deter other biopharmaceutical customers from using our services or may result in our customers seeking to
place limits on our ability to serve other biopharmaceutical industry participants. In addition, our further expansion
into the broader healthcare market may adversely impact our relationships with biopharmaceutical customers, and
such customers may elect not to use our services, reduce the scope of services that we provide to them or seek to
place restrictions on our ability to serve customers in the broader healthcare market with interests that are adverse to
theirs. Any loss of customers or reductions in the level of revenues from a customer could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.


-----

**_Our results of operations may be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our goodwill and_**
**_intangible assets._**

As of June 30, 2023, our pro forma goodwill and net intangible assets were valued at $7.1 billion, which
constituted approximately 71.6% of our pro forma total assets.

Our goodwill is principally related to the acquisition of inVentiv completed in August 2017. Goodwill is
tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is one level below the operating segment level. This test
requires us to determine if the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is less than its carrying amount.
The impairment analysis requires significant judgments, estimates and assumptions. There is no assurance that the
actual future earnings or cash flows of the reporting units will not decline significantly from the projections used in
the impairment analysis. Goodwill impairment charges may be recognized in future periods in one or more of the
reporting units to the extent changes in factors or circumstances occur, including deterioration in the
macroeconomic environment or industry, deterioration in our performance or our future projections, or changes in
plans for one or more of our reporting units. As of June 30, 2023, our goodwill is assigned to four reporting units.
We completed our annual impairment test as of October 1, 2022 for all of our reporting units and concluded that
there were no impairments. However, during the fourth quarter of 2022, we performed a quantitative analysis for
our Communications reporting unit, which had a goodwill balance of $529.1 million as of December 31, 2022. We
concluded that the estimated fair value of our Communications reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by
approximately $19.0 million, or 3%, and therefore no impairment existed. Given this small excess in the estimated
fair value over the carrying value, the Company may be at increased risk of a non-cash impairment charge in the
future.

Intangible assets consist of customer relationships, acquired backlog, trade names, trademarks, patient
communities, and acquired technologies. We review intangible assets at the end of each reporting period to
determine if facts and circumstances indicate that the useful life is shorter than originally estimated or that the
carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. If such facts and circumstances exist, we assess the
recoverability of identified assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the
related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives to their respective carrying amounts. Impairments, if any,
are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets and occur in the period in which
the impairment determination was made. We have experienced material impairment losses in the past, and could
experience additional material impairment losses in the future. The process of testing intangible assets for
impairment involves numerous judgments, assumptions, and estimates made by management including expected
future profitability, cash flows, and the fair values of assets and liabilities, which inherently reflect a high degree of
uncertainty and may be affected by significant variability. If the business climate deteriorates, then actual results
may not be consistent with these judgments, assumptions, and estimates, and our intangible assets may become
impaired in future periods. Various factors could reasonably be expected to unfavorably impact the assumptions
underlying our impairment analysis, including delays in awards and the related delay in revenue, increases in
termination activity, continued deterioration of macroeconomic conditions, or increases in operating costs. The
deterioration of the business climate or other unanticipated changes to our business and any potential impairment
losses caused as a result of such changes could in turn have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition,
and results of operations.

**_We face risks arising from the restructuring of our operations, which could adversely affect our financial_**
**_condition, results of operations, cash flows, or business reputation._**

From time to time, we have implemented certain cost savings initiatives to improve operating efficiency
through various means, including: (i) the reduction of overcapacity, primarily in our costs of services (billable)
function; (ii) elimination of non-billable roles; and (iii) the consolidation or other realignment of our resources.
During the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, we recognized approximately $32.1 million of employee severance
costs, facility closure and lease termination costs of $94.9 million, and $0.5 million of other costs related to
optimizing our resources worldwide.

Restructuring actions present significant risks that could have a material adverse effect on our operations,
financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or business reputation. Such risks include:

    - a decrease in employee morale and retention of key employees;


-----

    - a greater number of employment claims;

    - actual or perceived disruption of service or reduction in service standards to customers;

    - the failure to preserve supplier relationships and distribution, sales and other important relationships,
and to resolve conflicts that may arise;

    - the failure to achieve targeted cost savings; and

    - the failure to meet operational targets and customer requirements due to the loss of employees and any
work stoppages that might occur.

**_We operate in many different jurisdictions and we could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA, the UK_**
**_Bribery Act of 2010, and/or similar worldwide anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws._**

The FCPA, the UK Bribery Act of 2010, and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws prohibit companies
and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our
internal policies mandate compliance with these anti-corruption laws. We operate in many parts of the world that
have experienced corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, anti-corruption laws have appeared to
conflict with local customs and practices. Despite our training and compliance programs, we cannot assure that our
internal control policies and procedures will protect us from acts in violation of anti-corruption laws committed by
persons associated with us, and our continued expansion outside the U.S., including in developing countries, could
increase such risk in the future. Violations of the FCPA or other ex-U.S. anti-corruption laws, or even allegations of
such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results
of operations, cash flows, and reputation. For example, violations of anti-corruption laws can result in restatements
of, or irregularities in, our financial statements as well as severe criminal or civil sanctions. In some cases,
companies that violate the FCPA (or similar laws in other jurisdictions outside the U.S.) might be debarred by the
U.S. government and/or lose their U.S. export privileges. In addition, U.S. or other governments might seek to hold
us liable for successor liability for FCPA violations or violations of other anti-corruption laws committed by
companies that we acquire or in which we invest, or by or on behalf of persons working for or representing our
Company. Changes in anti-corruption laws or enforcement priorities could also result in increased compliance
requirements and related costs which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations,
and cash flows.

**_The failure of third parties to provide us support services could adversely affect our business, financial condition,_**
**_results of operations, cash flows, or reputation._**

We depend on third parties for support services vital to our business. Such support services include, but are
not limited to, IT services, laboratory services, third-party transportation and travel providers, freight forwarders and
customs brokers, drug depots and distribution centers, suppliers or contract manufacturers of drugs for patients
participating in clinical trials, and providers of licensing agreements, maintenance contracts, or other services. In
addition, we also rely on third-party CROs and other contract clinical personnel for clinical services in regions
where we have limited resources, in cases where demand cannot be met by our internal staff, or in cases where such
third-party CROs can provide services more efficiently. The failure of any of these third parties to adequately
provide us critical support services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results
of operations, cash flows, or reputation.

**_Our embedded and functional outsourcing services could subject us to employment liability, which may cause_**
**_adverse effects on our business._**

With our embedded and functional outsourcing services, we place employees at the physical workplaces of
our customers. The risks of this activity include claims of errors and omissions, misuse or misappropriation of client
proprietary information, theft of client property, and torts or other claims under employment liability, coemployment liability, or joint employment liability. We have policies and guidelines in place to reduce our exposure
to such risks, but if we fail to follow these policies and guidelines we may suffer reputational damage, loss of
customer relationships and business, and monetary damages.

**_Our increasing focus on environmental sustainability and social initiatives could increase our costs, and inaction_**
**_could harm our reputation and adversely impact our financial results._**

There has been increasing public focus by investors, customers, environmental activists, the media, and
governmental and nongovernmental organizations on a variety of environmental, social, and other sustainability
matters. As an organization, we understand the importance of our role in lessening our environmental footprint and
supporting positive social impact. We established a cross-functional team to make commitments relating to
sustainability matters that affect us, including the design and implementation of specific risk mitigation strategic
initiatives relating to sustainability. In light of the importance of this to our culture, as well as internal and external
stakeholders, if we are not effective in addressing environmental, social and other sustainability matters affecting
our business, or setting and meeting relevant sustainability goals, our reputation and financial results may suffer. We
may experience increased costs in order to execute upon our sustainability goals and measure achievement of those
goals, which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition.

In addition, this emphasis on environmental, social, and other sustainability matters has resulted and may
result in the adoption of new laws and regulations, including new reporting requirements. If we fail to comply with
new laws, regulations, or reporting requirements, our reputation and business could be adversely impacted. In
addition, compliance with new laws, regulations, and reporting requirements may increase our costs, result in
disclosures of potentially competitively sensitive information, or may cause us to be targeted by activists, regulators,
or others who want us to take a different approach to such matters or increase our disclosures or commitments.

Moreover, investor advocacy groups, investment funds, and influential investors are increasingly focused
on these practices, especially as they relate to the environment, health and safety, diversity, labor conditions, and
human rights. Failure to adapt to or comply with regulatory requirements or investor or stakeholder expectations and
standards could negatively impact our reputation, ability to do business with certain partners. In addition, certain
environmental and social disclosures and commitments we make may be reliant in part or in whole on third party
information, which we cannot verify the quality of, and third party performance, which we cannot guarantee. We
may fail to meet our environmental and social commitments either entirely or on the schedule we commit to.

**_Our operations could be adversely impacted by climate change._**

Our operations may be susceptible to losses and interruptions caused by extreme weather conditions such
as droughts, hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and water or other natural resource shortages, occurrences of which may
increase in frequency and severity as a result of climate change. Climate change may also produce general changes
in weather or other environmental conditions, including temperature or precipitation levels. To the extent weather
conditions continue to be impacted by climate change, our operations and facilities may be adversely impacted in a
manner that we could not predict, which may in turn adversely impact our results of operations. In addition, the
potential physical effects of climate change, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, and other
climatic events, could disrupt our operations and cause us to incur significant costs to prepare for or respond to these
effects.

**_Downgrades of our credit ratings could adversely affect us._**

We can be adversely affected by downgrades of our credit ratings because ratings are a factor influencing
our ability to access capital and the terms of any new indebtedness, including covenants and interest rates. Our
customers and vendors may also consider our credit profile when negotiating contract terms, and if they were to
change the terms on which they deal with us, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations, cash flows, and financial condition.

Many of our vendors have the right to declare us in default of our agreements if any such vendor, including
the lessors under our vehicle fleet leases, determines that a change in our financial condition poses a substantially
increased credit risk. Upon default, the lessors can repossess the vehicles and require us to compensate them for any
remaining lease payments in excess of the value of the repossessed vehicles. As of June 30, 2023 we had $55.5
million in finance lease obligations, primarily related to vehicles used in Deployment Solutions in the U.S.
Deployment Solutions may be negatively impacted if we lose the use of vehicles for any period of time.


-----

Under the terms of the lease agreement for our corporate headquarters in Morrisville, North Carolina we
may be required to issue a letter of credit (“LOCs”) to the landlord based on our debt rating issued by Moody’s
Investors Service (or other nationally-recognized debt rating agency, such as S&P Global Ratings). As of December
31, 2022, our debt rating was such that no LOC was required. Our debt rating pro forma for the Transactions has not
yet been finalized but we expect that it will result in an LOC requirement that could be as much as $55 million.
Any LOCs issued in accordance with the aforementioned requirements would be issued under our New Revolving
Facility, and would reduce our available borrowing capacity by the same amount accordingly.

**_We may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings and expect to incur substantial expenses related to the_**
**_Merger, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of_**
**_operations._**

While we anticipate being able to achieve certain cost savings from the consummation of the Merger, our
ability to achieve such estimated cost savings in the timeframe described, or at all, is subject to various assumptions
by our management, which may or may not be realized, as well as the incurrence of other costs in our operations that
may offset all or a portion of such cost savings. As a consequence, we may not be able to realize cost savings within
the timeframe expected or at all. In addition, we may incur additional and/or unexpected costs in order to realize
these cost savings. Failure to achieve the expected cost savings could significantly reduce the expected benefits
associated with the Merger. Our presentation of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA in this offering circular reflects such
cost savings but does not reflect such expenditures. Accordingly, you should not view our presentation of these
adjustments in our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as a projection that we will achieve these cost savings but rather
only as an indication of our current expectations and to show how Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA will be calculated
for the purposes of monitoring covenant compliance in the credit agreements governing our New Credit Facilities
and the indenture that will govern the Notes.

In addition, we have incurred and will incur substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and
consummation of the Transactions. We expect to continue to incur non-recurring costs associated with
consummating the Merger and achieving the desired cost savings. These fees and costs have been, and will continue
to be, substantial. The substantial majority of non-recurring expenses will consist of transaction costs related to the
Merger and include, among others, fees paid to financial, legal and accounting advisors, employee benefit costs and
filing fees. These costs described above, as well as other unanticipated costs and expenses, could have a material
adverse effect on the financial condition and operating results of Syneos Health following the consummation of the
Merger.

**_Upon the consummation of the Merger, affiliates of the Sponsors will control us and their interests may conflict_**
**_with our interests and/or the interests of the holders of the Notes in the future._**

Investment funds and other investment vehicles affiliated with the Sponsors will indirectly beneficially
own a majority of our issued and outstanding capital stock. In addition, the Sponsors will have the right to designate
a majority of the members of our board of directors. As a result, the Sponsors will have control over our decisions to
enter into any corporate transaction and will have the ability to prevent any transaction that requires the approval of
our board of directors or shareholders, regardless of whether the holders of Notes believe that any such transactions
are in their own best interests. For example, the Sponsors could cause us to make acquisitions that increase the
amount of our indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, or to sell assets, which may impair our ability to make
payments under the Notes. In addition, to the extent permitted by the indenture that will govern the Notes and the
New Credit Agreement, the Sponsors may cause us to pay dividends rather than make capital expenditures or
otherwise use our funds for the benefit of our business.

In addition, the Sponsors are in the business of making investments in companies and may, from time to
time, acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. While we do not currently
compete with these investments, the Sponsors may vote in a manner so as to restrict us from expanding our business
or entering into additional lines of business which may be related to the current or future operations of these
investments. Also, the Sponsors may pursue acquisitions that may be complementary with our business and, as a
result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. So long as the Sponsors continue to indirectly own
a significant amount of our outstanding ordinary shares upon consummation of the Merger, even if such amount is
less than 50%, the Sponsors will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions.

**_Our future results may differ, possibly materially, from the pro forma financial information presented in this_**
**_offering circular._**

Our future results may be different, possibly materially, from those shown in the “Unaudited Pro Forma
Condensed Consolidated Financial Information” section of this offering circular for several reasons. While the
unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information presented in this offering circular is based on
assumptions regarding the Transactions and other estimates that we believe are reasonable under the
circumstances, this information is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to, and does not purport to,
represent what our actual results or financial condition would have been if the Transactions had been consummated.
The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information presented in this offering circular reflects
the impact of the Merger on our historical financial information using the acquisition method of
accounting, as required under GAAP. Pursuant to the acquisition method, we will record our tangible and
identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the acquisition date. The
excess of consideration transferred (i.e., purchase price) over the fair value of net assets acquired will be recorded as
goodwill.

Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if circumstances
indicate potential impairment. The valuation of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and
liabilities assumed has not yet been completed. The completion of the valuation upon consummation of the
Acquisition could result in significantly different amortization expenses and balance sheet classifications than those
presented in the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information included and incorporated by
reference in this offering circular. Additionally, we anticipate incurring costs relating to cost savings
initiatives, which have not been reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information
presented in this offering circular. Higher financing costs and lower than expected revenues could reduce our
profitability and our ability to generate cash, and may reduce the benefit of cost reduction and other initiatives.

**_The Merger may also give rise to unexpected liabilities and costs._**

Unexpected delays in connection with the post-Merger integration initiatives may significantly increase the
related costs and expenses incurred by us. If any of these circumstances were to occur, our operating expenses may
be higher than expected, reducing operating income and the expected benefits of the Merger . In addition, our actual
financing costs may be higher, and our revenues lower than those reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed
consolidated financial information.

**_Any litigation or government investigation against us could be costly and time-consuming to defend._**

We are subject to and may become subject, from time to time, to additional legal proceedings and claims
that arise in the ordinary course of business or pursuant to governmental or regulatory enforcement activity. While
we do not believe that the resolution of any currently pending lawsuits against us will, individually or in the
aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows,
we might be wrong, and future litigation might result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention and
resources, which might seriously harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
Insurance might not cover such claims, provide sufficient payments to cover all of the costs to resolve one or more
such claims, or continue to be available on terms acceptable to us. In particular, any claim could result in potential
liability for us if the claim is outside the scope of the indemnification agreement we have with our customers, our
customers do not abide by the indemnification agreement as required or the liability exceeds the amount of any
applicable indemnification limits or available insurance coverage. A claim brought against us that is uninsured or
underinsured could result in unanticipated costs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
results of operations, cash flows, or reputation.

**_If our insurance does not cover all of our indemnification obligations and other liabilities associated with our_**
**_operations, our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows may be materially adversely_**
**_affected._**

We maintain insurance designed to provide coverage for ordinary risks associated with our operations and
our ordinary indemnification obligations that we believe to be customary for our industry. The coverage provided by


-----

such insurance might not be adequate for all claims we make or may be contested by our insurance carriers. If our
insurance is not adequate or available to pay all claims or exposures associated with our operations, or if we are
unable to purchase adequate insurance at reasonable rates in the future, our business, financial condition, results of
operations, or cash flows may be materially adversely affected.

**Risks Related to Our Industry**

**_The biopharmaceutical services industry is highly competitive and our business could be materially impacted if_**
**_we do not compete effectively or rapidly adapt to technological change._**

The biopharmaceutical services industry is highly competitive. Our business often competes with other
biopharmaceutical services companies, internal discovery departments, development departments, sales and
marketing departments, IT departments, and other departments within our customers, some of which could be
considered large biopharmaceutical services companies in their own right with greater resources than ours. To the
extent that our clients choose to internally perform the clinical development and commercialization tasks that we
provide or to work with our competitors, our business will suffer. We also compete with universities, teaching
hospitals, governmental agencies, and others. If we do not compete successfully, our business will suffer. The
industry is highly fragmented, with numerous smaller specialized companies and a handful of companies with
global capabilities similar to certain of our own capabilities. Increased competition has led to price and other forms
of competition (such as acceptance of less favorable contract terms) that could adversely affect our operating results.
There are few barriers to entry for companies considering offering any one or more of the services we offer.
Because of their size and focus, these companies might compete effectively against us, which could have a material
adverse impact on our business.

In recent years, our industry has experienced increased consolidation which may continue and might put us
at risk of growing more slowly than our competitors that make acquisitions. This trend is likely to produce more
competition from the resulting larger companies, and ones without the cost pressures of being public, for both
customers and acquisition candidates. One specific aspect of this consolidation competition involves CROs entering
into transactions to attempt to control more access to clinical trial participants, like acquisition of site networks and
data. These trends could make it harder for us to compete successfully.

In addition, the emergence of the use of RWE and new approaches such as machine learning and artificial
intelligence that capitalize on the availability of large data sets may reduce the time and costs of the discovery and
development process, may allow our clients to more readily perform clinical development tasks and services that we
provide themselves, or may cause price competition. More broadly, our current competitors or other businesses
might develop technologies or services that are more effective or commercially attractive than, or render obsolete,
our current or future technologies and services. We may also fail to fully leverage the technologies available to us or
develop technologies quickly enough to be competitively useful, which we have experienced to a certain degree.
Our failure to develop and offer competitive services that address these and other technological advances in a
timely, cost-effective manner or to keep pace with rapid technological change could adversely affect our
competitive position and our results of operations.

Our future growth and success will depend on our ability to successfully compete with other companies
that provide similar services in the same markets, some of which may have financial, marketing, technical, staffing,
and other advantages. We also expect that competition will continue to increase as a result of consolidation among
these various companies. Large technology companies with substantial resources, technical expertise, and greater
brand power could also decide to enter or further expand in the markets where our business operates and compete
with us. If one or more of our competitors or potential competitors were to merge or partner with another of our
competitors, or if a new entrant emerged with substantial resources, the change in the competitive landscape could
adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. We compete on the basis of various factors, including breadth
and depth of services, customer engagement, reputation, reliability, quality, innovation, security, price, and industry
expertise and experience. In addition, our ability to compete successfully may be impacted by the growing
availability of health information from social media, government health information systems, and other free or lowcost sources. In addition, consolidation or integration of wholesalers, retail pharmacies, health networks, payers, or
other healthcare stakeholders may lead any of them to provide information services directly to customers or
indirectly through a designated service provider, resulting in increased competition from firms that may have lower


-----

costs to market (e.g., no data supply costs). Any of the above may result in lower demand for our services, which
could result in a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.

**_Outsourcing trends in the biopharmaceutical industry and changes in aggregate spending and R&D budgets_**
**_could adversely affect our operating results and growth rate._**

Our revenues depend on the level of R&D and commercialization expenditures, size of the drugdevelopment pipelines, and outsourcing trends of the biopharmaceutical industry, including the amount of such
R&D and commercialization spend that is outsourced and subject to competitive bidding amongst us and our
competitors. Accordingly, economic factors and industry trends that affect biopharmaceutical companies affect our
business.

Biopharmaceutical companies continue to seek long-term strategic collaborations with global CROs with
favorable pricing terms. Competition for these collaborations is intense and we might not be selected, in which case
a competitor may enter into the collaboration and our business with the customer, if any, may be limited. Our
success depends in part on our ability to establish and maintain preferred provider relationships with large
biopharmaceutical companies. Our failure to develop or maintain these preferred provider relationships could have a
material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Furthermore, in order to obtain preferred provider
relationships or other large contracts for commercialization services, we may have to reduce the prices for our
services, which could negatively impact our gross margin for these services.

Our SMID biopharmaceutical company clients may rely on funding from venture capital and other sources
to drive their business. During the year ended December 31, 2022, this funding was lower than historical periods.
When this funding is reduced, our SMID biopharmaceutical company clients have been and may in the future be
forced to reduce their outsourced R&D and commercialization expenditures or may be unable to pay for services
rendered, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

In addition, when the biopharmaceutical industry reduces its outsourcing of clinical trials or
commercialization services or such outsourcing fails to grow at projected rates, our business, financial condition,
results of operations, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. We may also be negatively
impacted by consolidation and other factors in the biopharmaceutical industry, which may slow decision making by
our customers, result in the delay or cancellation of existing projects, cause reductions in overall R&D expenditures,
or lead to increased pricing pressures. Further, in the event that one of our customers combines with a company that
is using the services of one of our competitors, the combined company could decide to use the services of that
competitor or another provider. All of these events could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash
flows, or results of operations.

**_Actions by government regulators or customers to limit a prescription’s scope or withdraw an approved product_**
**_from the market could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition._**

Government regulators have the authority, after approving a biopharmaceutical product, to limit its
indicated use, impose restrictions on its marketing, or withdraw it from the market completely based on safety or
other concerns. Similarly, customers may act to voluntarily limit the sales of biopharmaceutical products or
withdraw them from the market. Actions by payers to limit a product on a formulary list or restrict coverage or
reimbursement for a product can influence customer decisions to withdraw or limit market support for a product. In
the past, we have provided services with respect to products that have been limited or withdrawn. If we are
providing services to customers for products that are limited or withdrawn, we may be required to narrow the scope
of or terminate our services with respect to such products, which would prevent us from earning the full amount of
revenues anticipated under the related contracts with negative impacts to our business, results of operations, cash
flows, and financial condition.

**_If we fail to comply with federal, state, and foreign healthcare laws, including fraud and abuse laws, we could_**
**_face substantial penalties and our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects_**
**_could be adversely affected._**

Even though we do not and will not order healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid, or
other third-party payers, certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse are
and will be applicable to our business. We could be subject to healthcare fraud and abuse laws of both the federal


-----

government and the states in which we conduct our business. Because of the breadth of these laws and the
narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exceptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could
be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If we or our operations are found to be in violation of any of
the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties,
including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, and the curtailment or restructuring of our
operations, any of which could materially adversely affect our ability to operate our business, our financial results,
and our reputation.

**_We may be affected by healthcare reform and potential additional reforms which may adversely impact the_**
**_biopharmaceutical industry and reduce the need for our services or negatively impact our profitability._**

Numerous government bodies are considering or have adopted healthcare reforms and may undertake, or
are in the process of undertaking, efforts to control healthcare costs through legislation, regulation, and agreements
with HCPs and biopharmaceutical companies, including many of our customers. As governmental administrations
change and reforms take place, we are unable to predict what legislative proposals, if any, will be adopted in the
future. If regulatory cost-containment efforts limit the profitability of new drugs by, for example, continuing to
place downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing and/or increasing regulatory burdens and operating costs of the
biopharmaceutical industry, our customers may reduce their commercialization and R&D spending, which could
reduce the business they outsource to us. In addition, if regulatory requirements are relaxed or simplified drug
approval procedures are adopted, the demand for our services could decrease.

Government bodies have adopted and may continue to adopt new healthcare legislation or regulations that
are more burdensome than existing regulations. For example, product safety concerns and recommendations by the
Drug Safety Oversight Board could change the regulatory environment for drug products, and new or heightened
regulatory requirements may increase our expenses or limit our ability to offer some of our services. We might have
to incur additional costs to comply with these or other new regulations, and failure to comply could harm our
financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and reputation, and result in adverse legal action(s).
Additionally, new or heightened regulatory requirements may have a negative impact on the ability of our customers
to conduct industry-sponsored clinical trials, which could reduce the need for our post-approval development
services. For instance, in the EU, the Clinical Trials Regulation (“CTR”), which was adopted in April 2014, became
applicable on January 31, 2022. While the Clinical Trials Directive required a separate clinical trial application
(“CTA”) to be submitted in each member state, to both the competent national health authority and an independent
ethics committee, the CTR introduces a centralized process and only requires the submission of a single application
to all member states concerned. The CTR allows sponsors to make a single submission to both the competent
authority and an ethics committee in each member state, leading to a single decision per member state. The
assessment procedure of the CTA has been harmonized as well, including a joint assessment by all member states
concerned, and a separate assessment by each member state with respect to specific requirements related to its own
territory, including ethics rules. Each member state’s decision is communicated to the sponsor via the centralized
EU portal. Once the CTA is approved, clinical study development may proceed. The CTR foresees a three-year
transition period. The extent to which ongoing and new clinical trials will be governed by the CTR varies. For
clinical trials whose CTA was made under the Clinical Trials Directive before January 31, 2022, the Clinical Trials
Directive will continue to apply on a transitional basis for three years. Additionally, sponsors were permitted to
choose to submit a CTA under either the Clinical Trials Directive or the CTR until January 31, 2023 and, if
authorized, those were governed by the Clinical Trials Directive until January 31, 2025. By that date, all ongoing
trials will become subject to the provisions of the CTR. Compliance with the CTR requirements by us and our thirdparty service providers, such as CROs, may impact our development plans.

It is currently unclear to what extent the UK will seek to align its regulations with the EU. The UK
regulatory framework in relation to clinical trials is derived from existing EU legislation (as implemented into UK
law, through secondary legislation).

On January 17, 2022, the MHRA launched an eight-week consultation on reframing the UK legislation for
clinical trials. The consultation closed on March 14, 2022 and aims to streamline clinical trials approvals, enable
innovation, enhance clinical trials transparency, enable greater risk proportionality, and promote patient and public
involvement in clinical trials. The outcome of the consultation will be closely watched and will determine whether
the UK chooses to align with the regulation or diverge from it to maintain regulatory flexibility. A decision by the
UK not to closely align its regulations with the new approach that has been adopted in the EU may have an effect on


-----

the cost of conducting clinical trials in the UK as opposed to other countries and/or make it harder to seek a
marketing authorization in the EU for product candidates on the basis of clinical trials conducted in the UK.

**_Current and proposed laws and regulations regarding the protection of personal data could result in increased_**
**_risks of liability or increased cost to us or could limit our service offerings._**

The global data protection landscape is rapidly evolving, and we are or may become subject to numerous
state, federal and foreign laws, requirements, and regulations governing the collection, use, disclosure, retention,
and security of personal information, such as information we may collect about individuals in the U.S., the EEA, the
UK, and other countries where we have operations, including but not limited to Japan, China, South Korea, Brazil,
and Singapore. Federal, state, and foreign governments may propose or have adopted additional legislation
governing the collection, possession, use, storage, or disclosure of personal data, including but not limited to health
and financial data, as well as security breach notification rules for loss or theft of such data. Additional legislation or
regulation of this type might, among other things, require us to implement additional security measures and
processes or to anonymize or de-identify health or other personal data in excess of what we are already obliged to
do, each of which may require substantial expenditures or limit our ability to offer some of our services. Failure to
comply with these data protection and privacy laws, rules, and regulations, or to resolve any privacy or security
complaints, could subject us to regulatory sanctions, fines, delays in clinical trials, criminal prosecution, or civil
liability, as well as reputational damage.

In the U.S., we are subject to certain state privacy and data security laws and regulations in the states in
which we operate, such as the CCPA, which became effective as of January 2020, and creates individual privacy
rights for California consumers and increases the privacy and security obligations of entities handling certain
personal information. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for
data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act (the
“CPRA”) recently passed in California. The CPRA will impose additional data protection obligations on covered
businesses, including additional consumer rights processes, limitations on data uses, new audit requirements for
higher risk data, and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It will also create a new California data protection
agency authorized to issue substantive regulations and could result in increased privacy and information security
enforcement. The majority of the provisions will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and additional compliance
investment and potential business process changes may be required. Similar laws have passed in Virginia and
Colorado, and have been proposed in other states and at the federal level, reflecting a trend toward more stringent
privacy legislation in the U.S. The enactment of such laws could have potentially conflicting requirements that
would make compliance challenging. In the event that we are subject to or affected by the CCPA, the CPRA, or
other domestic privacy and data protection laws, any liability from failure to comply with the requirements of these
laws could adversely affect our financial condition.

In the EEA, we are subject to the EU GDPR, and in the UK, we are subject to the UK data protection
regime consisting primarily of the UK General Data Protection Regulation, or UK GDPR, and the UK Data
Protection Act 2018, (collectively, the GDPR), in each case in relation to our collection, control, processing,
sharing, disclosure, and other use of data relating to an identifiable living individual (personal data). The GDPR
contains provisions specifically directed at the processing of health data, rights of data subjects, data breach
notification, and extra-territoriality measures intended to extend the applicability of the law to certain activities
performed by non-EEA/UK organizations (such as the targeting or monitoring of individuals located in the EEA/UK
by organizations located in other locations). Failure by us, or by our partners, our service providers, or our
employees or contractors, to comply with the GDPR could result in regulatory investigations, reputational damage,
orders to cease/ change our use of data, enforcement notices and/ or fines of the greater of €20 million/£17.5 million
or 4% of total global annual revenue, as well as potential civil claims including class actions where individuals
suffer harm. These changes may lead to additional compliance costs and could increase our overall risk. As we
expand into other foreign countries and jurisdictions, we may be subject to additional laws and regulations that may
affect how we conduct business.

In addition to data protection laws and regulations, regulators are considering (or are adopting) other laws,
regulations and guidelines that impact the processing of personal information. For example, the evolving landscape
surrounding the use of artificial intelligence and online advertising may lead to additional compliance costs and
could increase our overall risk.


-----

In addition, we operate on a global basis and may transfer personal data to our affiliates and service
providers in the course of administering our business and performing our services. As a result, we are subject to
legal requirements that govern the cross-border transfer of personal data. For example, the GDPR prohibits the
transfer of personal data outside the EEA and the UK to third countries that have not been found to provide
adequate protection to such personal data, including the U.S., in the absence of certain safeguards. We rely upon
Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”) and other appropriate safeguards or derogations for such transfers of
personal data.

The European Commission issued revised SCCs on June 4, 2021 to account for the decision of the CJEU
and recommendations made by the European Data Protection Board. The revised SCCs must be used for relevant
new data transfers from September 27, 2021; existing standard contractual clauses arrangements must be migrated
to the revised clauses by December 27, 2022. The new SCCs apply only to the transfer of personal data outside of
the EEA and not the UK; the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office launched a public consultation on its draft
revised data transfers mechanisms in August 2021. There is some uncertainty around whether the revised clauses
can be used for all types of data transfers, particularly whether they can be relied on for data transfers to non-EEA
entities subject to the GDPR.

As noted in prior disclosures, certain of our clinical entities relied in part on the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield frameworks to transfer certain personal data from the EU and Switzerland, respectively, to the U.S.
On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”) invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield.
Similarly, on September 8, 2020, Switzerland’s Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (“FDPIC”)
issued an opinion concluding that the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework does not provide an adequate level of
protection to transfer Personal Data from Switzerland to the U.S. Because of these developments, we no longer
leverage these frameworks to support the transfer of personal data from the EU and Switzerland to the U.S.,
although we continue participation in them, in an effort to demonstrate our commitment to the protection of
personal data.

We are accountable for the acts and omissions of our third-party service providers we engage to process
personal data on our behalf, subject to limitations and exclusions provided by law. There is no assurance that
contractual measures and our own privacy and security-related safeguards will protect us from the risks associated
with the third-party processing, storage, and transmission of such information. Any violation of data protection laws
by our third-party processors could have a material adverse effect on our business and result in the fines and
penalties outlined above.

Although we work to comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards, our contractual obligations,
and other legal obligations, these requirements are evolving and may be modified, interpreted, and applied in an
inconsistent manner from one jurisdiction to another, and may conflict with one another or other legal obligations
with which we must comply. Any failure or perceived failure by us or our employees, representatives, contractors,
consultants, collaborators, or other third parties to comply with such requirements or adequately address privacy and
security concerns, even if unfounded, could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, and
adversely affect our business and results of operations.

**_Our customers face intense competition from lower cost generic products and other competing products, which_**
**_may lower the amount that they spend on our services and could have a material adverse effect on our business,_**
**_results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition._**

Our customers face increasing competition from competing products and, in particular, from lower cost
generic products, which in turn may affect their ability to pursue clinical development and commercialization
activities. In the U.S., the EU and Japan, political pressure to reduce spending on prescription products has led to
legislation and other measures which encourage the use of generic products. In addition, proposals emerge from
time to time in the U.S. and other countries for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of
generic products. Loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by generic substitutes,
reducing our customers’ sales of that product and their overall profitability. Availability of generic substitutes for
our customers’ products or other competing products may cause them to lose market share and, as a result, may
adversely affect their results of operations and cash flow, which in turn may mean that they would not have
adequate capital to purchase our services. If competition from generic or other products impacts our customers’


-----

finances such that they decide to curtail our services, our net revenues may decline and this could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

**_The biopharmaceutical industry has a history of patent and other intellectual property litigation and we might be_**
**_involved in costly intellectual property lawsuits._**

The biopharmaceutical industry has a history of intellectual property litigation and these lawsuits will likely
continue in the future. Accordingly, we may face patent infringement suits or be called upon to provide
documentation by companies that have patents for similar business processes or other suits alleging infringement of
their intellectual property rights. Legal proceedings relating to intellectual property could be expensive, take
significant time, and divert management’s attention from other business concerns, regardless of the outcome of the
litigation. In the event an infringement lawsuit was brought against us and we did not prevail, we might have to pay
substantial damages and we could be required to stop infringing activity or obtain a license to use technology on
unfavorable terms.

**Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes**

**_Our substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit_**
**_our ability to react to changes in the economy or our market, expose us to interest rate risk, and prevent us from_**

As of June 30, 2023, on a pro forma basis as described under “Capitalization,” we would have had
approximately $3,700 million of total indebtedness (including the Notes offered hereby), all of which would have
been first priority senior secured indebtedness. In addition, we would have had $485.8 million available for
borrowing under the New Revolving Facility (after taking account of $14.2 million of undrawn letters of credit),
subject to customary borrowing conditions. Any borrowings under the New Revolving Facility, once made, would
constitute first priority senior secured indebtedness. If we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to
service our debt, we may need to refinance our debt, dispose of assets, or issue equity to obtain necessary funds; we
do not know whether we will be able to take any of such actions on a timely basis or on terms satisfactory to us or at
all.

Our high degree of leverage could have important consequences, including:

    - making it more difficult for us to make payments on the New Credit Facilities, the Notes and our other
obligations;

    - increasing our vulnerability to general economic and market conditions and to changes in the industries
in which we compete;

    - requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal
and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our
operations, future working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, future strategic
business opportunities, or other general corporate requirements;

    - making it difficult for us to optimally capitalize and manage the cash flow for our businesses;

    - restricting us from making acquisitions or causing us to make divestitures or similar transactions;

    - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service
requirements, investments, acquisitions, and general corporate or other purposes;

    - limiting our ability to plan for, and adjust to, changes in our business and the industry in which we
operate and for changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to
our competitors who are less highly leveraged; and


-----

    - increasing our cost of borrowing.

Borrowings under our New Credit Facilities will be subject to variable rates of interest and expose us to
interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations may increase even though the amount
borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our
indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease.

Additionally, our ability to comply with the financial and other covenants contained in our debt instruments
may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions or other events beyond our control. If we do not
comply with these covenants and restrictions, we may be required to take actions such as reducing or delaying
capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing all or part of our existing debt, or seeking additional
equity capital.

**_Despite our level of indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt,_**
**_including off-balance sheet financing, contractual obligations, and general and commercial liabilities. This could_**
**_further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above._**

We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future, including
additional tranches of term loans and/or term loan increases, increases to our revolving commitments and/or
additional revolving credit facilities, additional secured or unsecured debt facilities as well as off-balance sheet
financings, contractual obligations, and general and commercial liabilities. Although the terms of the New Credit
Agreement and the indenture that will govern the Notes will contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional
indebtedness, such restrictions are subject to a number of significant exceptions and qualifications and any
additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with such restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also
will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. If we and our subsidiaries incur
significant additional indebtedness or other obligations, the related risks that we face could increase.

If the Issuer or the guarantors incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the Notes and the
related guarantees, the holders of that debt will be entitled to share ratably with such holders in any proceeds
distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of the
Issuer or a guarantor, subject to any collateral arrangements. This may have the effect of reducing the amount of
proceeds paid to the holders of the Notes. Further, such secured debt would be effectively senior to any of the
Issuer’s and guarantors’ existing and future unsecured indebtedness and junior lien indebtedness to the extent of the
value of the assets securing the notes.

**_The New Credit Agreement and the indenture that will govern the Notes each will impose significant operating_**
**_and financial restrictions on us and our restricted subsidiaries, which may prevent us from capitalizing on_**
**_business opportunities._**

The New Credit Agreement and the indenture that will govern the Notes each will contain operating
covenants and restrictions that limit our operations and could lead to adverse consequences if we fail to comply with
them. These restrictions will limit the Issuer’s ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to, among other
things:

    - incur or guarantee additional debt or issue disqualified stock or preferred stock;

    - declare or pay dividends and make other distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock;

    - make certain investments, loans and advances;

    - incur certain liens;

    - enter into certain transactions with affiliates;

    - merge or consolidate, or sell, transfer, lease or dispose of substantially all of our assets;


-----

    - enter into agreements that restrict the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make dividends or other
payments to the Issuer or the guarantors;

    - designate restricted subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and

    - transfer or sell certain assets.

In addition, we and our restricted subsidiaries will be subject to certain additional covenants in respect of
the New Credit Facilities, and the New Credit Agreement will include certain customary event of default provisions.
See “Description of Certain Other Indebtedness.”

The restrictions in the New Credit Agreement and the indenture that will govern the Notes may prevent us
from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business, and may make it difficult for us to
successfully execute our business strategy or effectively compete with companies that are not subject to similar
restrictions. We may also incur additional debt obligations in the future that could subject us to additional restrictive
covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility. We cannot assure you that we will be able to
maintain compliance with these covenants and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from the
applicable lenders and/or amend the applicable covenants.

Failure to comply with these covenants could result from, among other things, changes in our results of
operations, the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the pricing of our products, our success at implementing cost
reduction initiatives, our ability to successfully implement our overall business strategy or changes in general
economic conditions, which may be beyond our control. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could
result in a default or event of default under the New Credit Agreement and/or the indenture that will govern the
Notes, which, if not cured or waived, could result in our being required to repay these borrowings before their due
date. If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or cannot refinance these borrowings,
our prospects, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely
affected and could cause us to become bankrupt or otherwise insolvent. In addition, these covenants may restrict our
ability to engage in transactions that we believe would otherwise be in the best interests of our business and
shareholders.

See “Description of Certain Other Indebtedness” for additional information about the covenants set forth in
the New Credit Agreement and “Description of the Notes” for additional information about the covenants set forth
in the indenture that will govern the Notes.

**_Repayment of our debt, including required principal and interest payments on the Notes, is dependent on cash_**
**_flow generated by our subsidiaries, which may be subject to limitations beyond our control._**

Our subsidiaries own a substantial portion of our assets and conduct all of our operations. Accordingly,
repayment of our indebtedness, including the Notes, is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries
and, if they are not guarantors, their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or
otherwise.

Unless they are guarantors, the Issuer’s subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the
Notes or to make funds available to the Issuer or the guarantors for that purpose. Our non-guarantor subsidiaries
may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our
indebtedness, including the Notes. Each non-guarantor subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and, under certain
circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our non-guarantor
subsidiaries.

In the event that we are unable to receive distributions from subsidiaries, we may be unable to make
required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, including the Notes.


-----

**_We may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our significant debt service obligations, which could_**
**_have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows._**

We will require a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness. Our ability to make scheduled
payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance,
which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative,
regulatory, and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from
operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and/or interest on our indebtedness.
If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to
reduce or delay investments, acquisitions, capital expenditures, and payments on account of other obligations, seek
additional capital, restructure or refinance our indebtedness, or sell assets. These alternative measures may not be
successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our ability to restructure or
refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any
refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and could require us to comply with more onerous
covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be
able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.

If we are at any point unable to repay or otherwise refinance our indebtedness when due, or if any other
event of default is not cured or waived, the applicable lenders could accelerate our outstanding obligations or
proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness, which could force us into bankruptcy or
liquidation. In the event the applicable lenders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries
may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. Any acceleration of amounts due under the New Credit
Agreement or the exercise by the applicable lenders of their rights under the security documents would likely have a
material adverse effect on our business.

**_In the event of a bankruptcy of the Issuer or any of the guarantors, the holders of the Notes may be deemed to_**
**_have an unsecured claim to the extent that the Issuer’s obligations in respect of the Notes exceed the fair market_**
**_value of the Collateral securing the Notes and the related guarantees (after taking into account all of our other_**
**_obligations secured thereby on a senior or pari passu basis)._**

In any bankruptcy proceeding with respect to the Issuer or any of the guarantors, it is possible that the
bankruptcy trustee, the debtor-in-possession or competing creditors will assert that the fair market value of the
Collateral with respect to the Notes on the date of the bankruptcy filing was less than the then-current principal
amount of the Notes and all of our other obligations secured thereby on a senior or pari passu basis. Upon a finding
by the bankruptcy court that the Notes are under-collateralized, the claims in the bankruptcy proceeding with respect
to the Notes would be bifurcated between a secured claim and an unsecured claim, and the unsecured claim would
not be entitled to the benefits of security in the Collateral. In such event, the secured claims of the holders of the
Notes would be limited to the value of the Collateral.

The consequences of a finding of under-collateralization would include, among other things, a lack of
entitlement on the part of the holders of the Notes to receive post-petition interest, fees, and expenses and a lack of
entitlement on the part of the unsecured portion of the Notes to receive “adequate protection” under federal
bankruptcy laws, as discussed above. In addition, if any payments of post-petition interest had been made at the time
of such a finding of under-collateralization, those payments could be re-characterized by the bankruptcy court as a
reduction of the principal amount of the secured claim with respect to the Notes.

**_If a bankruptcy petition were filed by or against us in the United States, the allowed claim for the Notes may be_**
**_less than the principal amount of the Notes stated in the indenture._**

If a bankruptcy petition were filed by or against us under Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended
(the “U.S. Bankruptcy Code”) after the issuance of the Notes, the claim by any holder of the Notes for the principal
amount thereof may be allowed in an amount equal to the sum of:

    - the original issue price of the Notes; and


-----

    - that portion of the stated principal amount of the Notes that exceeds the issue price thereof (as
applicable), if any, that does not constitute “unmatured interest” for the purposes of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code.

Any such discount that was not amortized as of the date of the bankruptcy filing would constitute
unmatured interest, which is not allowable as part of a bankruptcy claim under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
Accordingly, holders of the Notes under these circumstances may receive an amount that is less than the principal
amount thereof stated in the indenture that will govern the Notes.

**_If the financial institutions that are part of the syndicate of our New Revolving Facility fail to extend credit under_**
**_such facility, our liquidity and results of operations may be adversely affected._**

Following the consummation of the Transactions, we will have access to capital through our New
Revolving Facility, which will be governed by the New Credit Agreement. Each financial institution which is part of
the syndicate for our New Revolving Facility will be responsible on a several, but not joint, basis for providing a
portion of the loans to be made under our New Revolving Facility. If any participant or group of participants with a
significant portion of the commitments in our New Revolving Facility fails to satisfy its or their respective
obligations to extend credit under the New Revolving Facility and we are unable to find a replacement for such
participant or participants on a timely basis (if at all), our liquidity may be adversely affected.

**_We may utilize derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in interest_**
**_rates on our variable rate indebtedness, including our New Credit Facilities, and we will be exposed to risks_**
**_related to counterparty credit worthiness or non-performance of these instruments._**

We may enter into interest rate swap instruments to limit our exposure to changes in variable interest rates.
While our hedging strategy is designed to minimize the impact of increases in interest rates applicable to our
variable rate debt, including our New Credit Facilities, there can be no guarantee that our hedging strategy will be
effective, and we may experience credit-related losses in some circumstances.

**_Interest rate fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial_**
**_condition and cash flows._**

Indebtedness under the New Credit Facilities will bear interest at variable rates. Because we will have
substantial variable rate debt, fluctuations in interest rates may affect our business, results of operations, financial
condition and cash flows. We may attempt to minimize interest rate risk and lower our overall borrowing costs
through the utilization of derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps and interest rate caps. As of
June 30, 2023, on a pro forma basis as described under “Capitalization” (which assumes no outstanding borrowings
under our New Revolving Facility), we would have had approximately $2,000 million aggregate principal amount of
variable rate indebtedness. A change of 0.125% in the weighted-average interest rate of such debt would increase or
decrease our estimated pro forma annual interest expense by approximately $2.5 million. See “Unaudited Pro Forma
Condensed Consolidated Financial Information.”

**_We are exposed to additional risks related to variable interest rates._**

Indebtedness under the New Term Facility and the New Revolving Facility will bear interest based on the
Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), U.S. Prime Rate or Federal Funds Rate. Thus, a change in the shortterm interest rate environment (particularly a material change) could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and could cause the market value of our debt securities to
decline.

**_We may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control._**

Upon the occurrence of specific kinds of change of control events, we will be required to offer to
repurchase all outstanding Notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount, together with accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to, but excluding, the purchase date. Additionally, under the terms of the New Credit Facilities, a


-----

change of control may constitute an event of default that permits the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings
under the respective agreements and terminate their commitments to lend. The source of funds for any purchase of
the Notes and repayment of borrowings under the New Credit Facilities would be our available cash or cash
generated from our subsidiaries’ operations or other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets or sales of equity.
We may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control because we may not have sufficient financial
resources to purchase all of the debt securities that are tendered upon a change of control and repay our other
indebtedness that will become due. We may require additional financing from third parties to fund any such
purchases, and we may be unable to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or at all. Further, our ability to repurchase
the Notes may be limited by law. In order to avoid the obligations to repurchase the Notes and events of default and
potential breaches of the terms of the New Credit Facilities, we may have to avoid certain change of control
transactions that would otherwise be beneficial to us.

**_We can enter into transactions like recapitalizations, reorganizations and other highly leveraged transactions that_**
**_do not constitute a change of control but that could adversely affect the holders of the Notes._**

Some important corporate events, such as leveraged recapitalizations, may not, under the indenture that will
govern the Notes, constitute a “change of control” that would require us to repurchase the Notes, even though those
corporate events could increase the level of our indebtedness or otherwise adversely affect our capital structure,
credit ratings, financial condition or the value of the Notes. Therefore, we could, in the future, enter into certain
transactions which would not constitute a change of control under the indenture that will govern the Notes, but that
could increase the amount of indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit
ratings. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.”

**_Holders of Notes may not be able to determine when a change of control giving rise to their right to have the_**
**_Notes purchased has occurred following a sale of “substantially all” of our assets._**

The definition of change of control in the indenture that will govern the Notes will include a phrase relating
to the sale of “all or substantially all” of our assets. There is no precise established definition of the phrase
“substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Notes to require the Issuer to
purchase its Notes as a result of a sale of less than all our assets to another person may be uncertain. See
“Description of the Notes—Change of Control.”

**_Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws may permit a court to void the Notes or the related guarantees and any_**
**_related security, and if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the Notes._**

Federal and state fraudulent transfer and conveyance statutes may apply to the issuance of the Notes and
the incurrence of the guarantees of the Notes and any related security. Under federal bankruptcy law and comparable
provisions of state fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws, which may vary from state to state, the Notes or the
guarantees thereof and any related security could be voided as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance if the Issuer or a
guarantor, as applicable, (i) issued the Notes or incurred its guarantee with the intent of hindering, delaying or
defrauding creditors or (ii) received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for either
issuing the Notes or incurring the guarantee or any related security and, in the case of clause (ii) only, one of the
following is also true at the time thereof:

    - the Issuer or such guarantor, as applicable, was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the
issuance of the Notes or the incurrence of its guarantees (and any related security);

    - the issuance of the Notes or the incurrence of its guarantees (or related security) left the Issuer or such
guarantor, as applicable, with an unreasonably small amount of capital or assets to carry on the
business as engaged in or anticipated;

    - the Issuer or such guarantor intended to, or believed that it would, incur indebtedness beyond its ability
to pay as they mature; or


-----

    - the Issuer or such guarantor was a defendant in an action for money damages, or had a judgment for
money damages docketed against it if, in either case, the judgment is unsatisfied after final judgment.

As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or
obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is secured or satisfied. A court would likely find that a
guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for its guarantee or security interest to the
extent the guarantor did not obtain a reasonably equivalent benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the
Notes. Thus, if the guarantees were legally challenged, any guarantee could be subject to the claim that, since the
guarantee was incurred for the Issuer’s benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit of the guarantor, the obligations of
the applicable guarantor were incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration. Therefore, a
court could void the obligations under the guarantees (and any related security interest), subordinate them to the
applicable guarantor’s other debt or take other action detrimental to the holders of the Notes.

The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer laws vary
depending upon the law of the jurisdiction that is being applied, such that we cannot be certain as to the standards a
court would use to determine whether or not the Issuer or a guarantor was insolvent at the relevant time or,
regardless of the standard that a court uses, that the Issuer or a guarantor was indeed insolvent on that date; that any
payments to the holders of the Notes (including under the guarantees) did not constitute preferences, fraudulent
conveyances or fraudulent transfers on other grounds; or whether the Notes or the guarantees and any related
security would be subordinated to our or a guarantor’s other indebtedness. In general, however, a court would deem
an entity insolvent if:

    - the sum of its indebtedness, including contingent and unliquidated liabilities, was greater than the fair
value of all of its assets;

    - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its
probable liability on its existing indebtedness, including contingent and unliquidated liabilities, as they
become absolute and mature; or

    - it could not pay its indebtedness as they became due.

If a court were to find that the issuance of the Notes or the incurrence of a guarantee and any related
security was a fraudulent transfer or conveyance or other reviewable or avoidable transaction, the court could void
the payment obligations under the Notes or that guarantee or security interest, could subordinate the Notes or that
guarantee or security interest to presently existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer or of the relevant guarantor
or could require the holders of the Notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the Notes or that guarantee
or security interest. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent transfer or conveyance or other reviewable transaction
occurred, you may not receive any repayment on the Notes. The indenture that will govern the Notes will also
permit guarantees by foreign subsidiaries to be limited to the extent necessary to comply with applicable local law,
and these limitations could limit the value of the guarantees. Further, the avoidance of the Notes could result in an
event of default with respect to our and our subsidiaries’ other indebtedness that could result in acceleration of that
indebtedness.

Although the indenture that will govern the Notes will contain a “savings clause” intended to limit a
guarantor’s liability under its guarantee to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the guarantee to
be a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under applicable law, this provision may not be effective as a legal
matter or otherwise to protect those guarantees from being avoided under fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent
transfer law or otherwise, or may reduce that guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its
guarantee worthless.

In addition, any payment by the Issuer or the relevant guarantors under the Notes or a guarantee could be
avoided and required to be returned to such Issuer or guarantors, as the case may be, or deposited in a fund for the
benefit of the creditors of such Issuer or guarantor. Among other things, a payment could potentially be avoided if
such payment is made to an insider within a one-year period prior to a bankruptcy filing or within 90 days for any


-----

non-insider party, and such payment would give such insider or non-insider party more than such party would have
received in a distribution in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

Finally, as a court of equity, the bankruptcy court may subordinate the claims in respect of the Notes to
other claims against us under the principle of equitable subordination if the court determines that (i) the holder of
Notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct, (ii) the inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other
creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holders of Notes and (iii) equitable subordination is not
inconsistent with the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

**_Because each guarantor’s liability under its guarantees may be reduced to zero, voided or released under certain_**
**_circumstances, holders of Notes may not receive any payments from some or all of the guarantors._**

Holders of Notes have the benefit of the guarantees of the guarantors. However, the guarantees by the
guarantors are limited to the maximum amount that the guarantors are permitted to guarantee under applicable law.
As a result, a guarantor’s liability under its guarantee could be reduced to zero, depending upon the amount of other
obligations of such guarantor. Further, under the circumstances discussed more fully above, a court under federal or
state fraudulent conveyance and fraudulent transfer statutes could void the obligations under a guarantee or further
subordinate it to all other obligations of the guarantor. See “—Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws may permit
a court to void the Notes or the related guarantees and any related security, and if that occurs, you may not receive
any payments on the Notes.” In addition, you will lose the benefit of a particular guarantee if it is released under
certain circumstances described under “Description of the Notes—Guarantees.”

**_Holders of the Notes will not be entitled to registration rights, and we do not currently intend to register the Notes_**
**_under applicable securities laws, and there are significant restrictions on your ability to transfer or resell the_**
**_Notes._**

The Notes are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act
and applicable state securities laws. Therefore, you may transfer or resell the Notes only in a transaction registered
under or exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. We are
not required to and do not intend to register the Notes for resale under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any
other jurisdiction and we are not required and do not intend to offer to exchange the Notes for notes registered under
the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. Accordingly, you may have difficulty transferring
your Notes, and you may be required to bear the risk of your investment for an indefinite period of time. See
“Transfer Restrictions.”

**_Your ability to transfer the Notes may be limited by the absence of an active trading market, and an active trading_**
**_market may not develop for the Notes._**

We expect the Notes to be eligible for trading by “qualified institutional buyers,” as defined under Rule
144A (each a “QIB”), but we do not intend to list the Notes on any national securities exchange or include the Notes
in any automated quotation system. The initial purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the
Notes as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. However, the initial purchasers are not obligated to make a
market in the Notes, and, if commenced, they may discontinue their market-making activities at any time without
notice. In addition, recent regulatory actions by the SEC under Rule 15c2-11 of the Exchange Act may restrict the
ability of brokers and dealers to publish quotations on the Notes on any interdealer quotation system or other
quotation medium after January 4, 2025, which may materially adversely affect the liquidity and trading prices for
the Notes. Even if an active trading market for the Notes does develop, there is no guarantee that it will continue.
Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt has been subject to severe disruptions that have caused
substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The market, if any, for the Notes may experience
similar disruptions, and any such disruptions may adversely affect the liquidity in that market or the prices at which
you may sell your Notes. For these reasons, an active market for the Notes may not develop or be maintained, which
would adversely affect the market price and liquidity of the Notes. In that case, the holders of the Notes may not be
able to sell their Notes at a particular time or at a favorable price.


-----

**_Many of the covenants in the indenture that will govern the Notes will not apply, and the guarantees of the Notes_**
**_will be released, during any period in which the Notes are rated investment grade._**

Many of the covenants in the indenture that will govern the Notes will not apply to us, and the guarantees
of the Notes shall be released, during any period in which the Notes are rated investment grade from any two of
Standard & Poor’s Investors Ratings Service, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Fitch Ratings, Inc., provided at
such time no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing. These covenants restrict, among other
things, our ability to pay distributions, incur indebtedness and enter into certain other transactions. There can be no
assurance that the Notes will ever be rated investment grade, or that if they are rated investment grade, that the
Notes will maintain these ratings. However, suspension of these covenants and guarantees would allow us to engage
in certain transactions that would not be permitted while these covenants and guarantees were in force. To the extent
the covenants and guarantees are subsequently reinstated, any such actions taken while the covenants and guarantees
were suspended would not result in an event of default under the indenture that will govern the Notes. See
“Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade
Status.”

**_Claims of holders of the Notes will be structurally subordinated to claims of creditors of certain of our_**
**_subsidiaries that will not guarantee the Notes._**

The Notes will not be guaranteed by certain of our existing and future subsidiaries. Only Holdings and the
Issuer’s wholly-owned restricted subsidiaries that guarantee indebtedness under (or are borrowers under) the New
Credit Facilities will initially guarantee the Notes. On a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, the
non-guarantor subsidiaries generated approximately 32.9% of our consolidated revenues for the twelve months
ended June 30, 2023 and held approximately 19.9% of our consolidated assets and had no long-term debt
outstanding as of June 30, 2023, in each case after intercompany eliminations. In addition, the guarantee of certain
guarantors will be released in connection with a transfer of such guarantor in a transaction not prohibited by the
indenture that will govern the Notes or upon certain other events described in “Description of the Notes—
Guarantees.” The indenture that will govern the Notes will permit these non-guarantor subsidiaries to incur certain
additional debt and will not limit their ability to incur other liabilities that are not considered indebtedness
thereunder.

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the guarantees and the_**
**_Collateral securing the Notes will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, the guarantees of the Notes and any related security will be released
automatically. The guarantee of a guarantor of the Notes and any related security will be automatically released to
the extent such guarantor or security interest is released in connection with a sale or other disposition of the equity
interests of such guarantor in a transaction not prohibited by the indenture that will govern the Notes. As a result, the
Collateral securing the Notes may be released automatically to enable the sale, transfer or other disposal of such
Collateral in transactions not prohibited by the indenture that will govern the Notes, including the sale of any entity
in its entirety that owns or holds such Collateral. The Collateral securing the Notes may also be released
automatically upon the release of such guarantor from its guarantee as permitted by the indenture that will govern
the Notes or when such guarantor otherwise ceases to be a guarantor.

The indenture that will govern the Notes will also permit us to designate one or more of our restricted
subsidiaries that is a guarantor of the Notes as an unrestricted subsidiary, which will result in the guarantee of such
guarantor being automatically released. If a guarantor is released from its guarantee of the New Credit Facilities and
certain other indebtedness of the Issuer or any other guarantor, other than in connection with a refinancing of the
New Credit Facilities and such other indebtedness or a payment under such guarantee, or a guarantor ceases to be a
subsidiary as a result of any foreclosure of any pledge or security interest securing the secured indebtedness, such
subsidiary’s guarantee of the Notes will be automatically released as well, in which case any liens on the assets of
such subsidiary in favor of the Notes will also be released. If the guarantee of any guarantor is released, no holder of
the Notes will have a claim as a creditor against that subsidiary, and the indebtedness and other liabilities, including
trade payables and preferred stock, if any, whether secured or unsecured, of that subsidiary will be structurally
senior to the claim of any holders of the Notes. For a description of all circumstances in which a guarantor’s


-----

subsidiary guarantee and the Collateral securing the Notes will be automatically released, see “Description of the
Notes—Guarantees” and “Description of the Notes—Security for the Notes.”

**_Changes in our credit rating or the rating of the Notes could negatively impact the market price or liquidity of the_**
**_Notes._**

Credit rating agencies continually revise their ratings for the companies that they follow, including us.
Credit rating agencies also evaluate our industry as a whole and may change their credit ratings for us based on their
overall view of our industry. We cannot be sure that credit rating agencies will maintain their ratings on the Notes. A
negative change in our ratings could have a negative impact on the future trading prices of the Notes and on our
ability to obtain future debt financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Furthermore, the ratings may not
reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed herein and
other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold
securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance
can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be
lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant,
such as adverse changes in our business.

In addition, we currently expect that, upon issuance, the Notes will be rated by Standard & Poor’s Investors
Ratings Service, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Fitch Ratings, Inc. A rating agency’s rating of the Notes is not
a recommendation to purchase, sell or hold any particular security, including the Notes. Such ratings are limited in
scope and do not comment as to material risks relating to an investment in the Notes. An explanation of the
significance of such rating may be obtained from such rating agency. There is no assurance that such credit ratings
will be issued or remain in effect for any given period of time. Rating agencies also may lower, suspend or withdraw
ratings on the Notes or our other debt in the future. Holders of the Notes will have no recourse against us or any
other parties in the event of a change in or suspension or withdrawal of such ratings. Any lowering, suspension or
withdrawal of such ratings may have an adverse effect on the market prices or marketability of the Notes.

**_The indenture that will govern the Notes will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and we will not be_**
**_required to comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act._**

The indenture that will govern the Notes will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and we will not
be required to comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act. Therefore, holders of the Notes will not be
entitled to the benefit of the provisions and protection of the Trust Indenture Act except to the extent there are
similar provisions in the indenture that will govern the Notes.

**_The terms and conditions of the New Credit Facilities have not been finalized._**

The New Credit Agreement that will govern the New Credit Facilities has not been finalized. The terms of
the New Credit Facilities are subject to market conditions, and we cannot assure you that the New Credit Facilities
will be completed in the manner, on the terms or on the timetable described herein. Future changes in market
conditions may result in less favorable terms for the New Credit Facilities and any changes to the terms of the New
Credit Facilities may increase our interest expense and adversely affect our business. The terms of the New Credit
Facilities could also change in a way that increases our indebtedness or makes it easier to incur debt in the future.

**_Certain actions in respect of defaults and amendments taken under the indenture governing the Notes by_**
**_beneficial owners, including those with short positions in excess of their interests in the Notes, will be_**
**_disregarded._**

By acceptance of the Notes, each holder of Notes (other than screened affiliates and regulated banks)
agrees, in connection with any notice of default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a
notice of default, notice of acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”), to (i) deliver a written
representation to the Issuer and the Trustee that such holder and any of its affiliates acting in concert with it in
connection with its investment in the Notes of such series (other than screened affiliates and regulated banks) are not
(or, in the case such holder is DTC or its nominee, that such holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners


-----

that (together with such affiliates) have represented to such holder that they are not) Net Short (as defined herein)
with respect to the Notes of such series and (ii) provide the Issuer with such other information as the Issuer may
reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such holder’s representation within five
business days of request therefor. These restrictions may impact a holder’s ability to participate in a Noteholder
Direction if it is unable to make such a representation.

**_Following consummation of the Merger, we will not be required to file reports with the SEC, and we will not be_**
**_subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The indenture that will govern the Notes will contain periodic reporting_**
**_requirements that will be different and less burdensome than would be applicable to us if we had agreed to_**
**_register the Notes immediately following the closing of the offering._**

Following the consummation of the Merger, we will not be required to file reports with the SEC. The
indenture that will govern the Notes will require us to provide annual, quarterly and certain material current reports
to the holders of the Notes and the Trustee. The content of the reports required by the indenture will, however, be
more limited than if we were subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. See “Description of the
Notes—Certain Covenants—Reports and Other Information.” In addition, following the consummation of the
Merger, we will not be subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires public companies to have and maintain
effective disclosure controls and procedures to ensure timely disclosure of material information, and have
management review the effectiveness of those controls on a quarterly basis. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act also requires
public companies to have and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and preparation of financial statements, and have
management review the effectiveness of those controls on an annual basis (and have the independent registered
public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of such internal controls). Following the consummation of the
Merger, we will not be required to comply with these internal control requirements, and therefore, we may not have
comparable controls or procedures in place as compared to public companies. Furthermore, the financial information
we provide to holders of the Notes and the Trustee may not be comparable to reports filed by public companies.

**Risks Related to the Escrow of Proceeds**

**_Purchasers of Notes in this offering will not know, at the time they agree to purchase Notes, whether or not this_**
**_offering will be funded into escrow. In the event that the Merger is not consummated on or prior to the Escrow_**
**_Outside Date, the Merger Agreement is terminated at any time prior thereto, or other conditions to the release of_**
**_the Escrowed Property are not satisfied, the Notes will be subject to special mandatory redemption and, as a_**
**_result, you may not obtain the return you expect on the Notes._**

The issuance of the Notes may not occur contemporaneously with completion of the Merger and the
establishment and effectiveness of the New Credit Facilities. If the Notes are issued prior to the consummation of
the Merger, pending the consummation of the Merger, on the issue date, the Issuer will enter into an escrow
agreement, pursuant to which the Issuer will deposit (or cause to be deposited) the Escrowed Property into the
Escrow Account as described in “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”
The Escrowed Property in the segregated Escrow Account will be pledged as security on a first-priority basis to the
Trustee for the benefit of such Trustee and the holders of the Notes until the Escrow Release Date. Consummation
of the Merger and the release of the Escrowed Property from the Escrow Account is subject to a number of
conditions, in each case, as further described in this offering circular. Upon delivery by the Issuer to the Escrow
Agent and the Trustee of an officer’s certificate instructing the Escrow Agent to release the Escrowed Property from
the Escrow Account and certifying, among other things, that prior to or substantially concurrent with the release of
such Escrowed Property on the Escrow Release Date, (i) the Merger will be consummated, (ii) the other
Transactions will be consummated and (iii) the guarantors (including Syneos Health) will become party to the
indenture and the guarantors will execute the collateral documents securing the Notes. See “Description of the
Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

Additional cash in respect of interest that would accrue on the Notes from and after the issue date will not
be pre-funded into the Escrow Accounts on the issue date, and, as a result, the Escrowed Property will be initially
limited to the gross proceeds from the offering and will not be sufficient to pay the Special Mandatory Redemption
Price, which includes accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the date of the special mandatory
redemption. The Sponsors (directly or through one or more affiliates) will commit on or prior to the date of the


-----

consummation of this offering, in the event of a special mandatory redemption, to fund the Shortfall Redemption
Amount. However, we cannot assure you that the Sponsors will have sufficient funds necessary to pay the Shortfall
Redemption Amount. If, among other things, the Merger is not consummated by the Escrow Outside Date, the
Issuer will be required to redeem all of the Notes on the date of the special mandatory redemption in accordance
with the terms of the indenture that will govern the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the initial issue
price of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of such special mandatory
redemption. Upon such redemption, you may not be able to reinvest the proceeds from the redemption in an
investment that yields comparable returns. Additionally, you may suffer a loss on your investment if you purchase
the Notes at a price greater than the issue price of such Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds;
Special Mandatory Redemption.” Although the Trustee, for the sole and exclusive benefit of itself and the holders of
the Notes, will be granted a first-priority security interest in the Escrowed Property deposited in the Escrow
Account, the ability of holders of the Notes to realize upon such Escrowed Property may be subject to certain
bankruptcy law limitations in the event of a bankruptcy of the Issuer. In addition, your decision to invest in the
Notes will be made prior to the consummation of the Merger and completion of certain closing conditions stated in
the Merger Agreement, and consequently you will not be afforded protection with respect to any adverse changes in
the business or financial condition of Syneos Health following the closing of this offering.

**_Until the consummation of the Merger, the Issuer will have limited assets and Syneos Health and its restricted_**
**_subsidiaries will not be subject to the covenants in the indenture governing the Notes._**

If the Merger is not consummated contemporaneously with this offering, on the issue date, the Notes will
be issued solely by, and will be the obligation solely of, the Issuer, as the Issuer, and will not be guaranteed by any
of the guarantors. The Issuer will have limited assets until the consummation of the Merger and no significant
independent operations until such time.

As a result, until the consummation of the Merger and the release of the Escrowed Property (if applicable),
holders of the Notes will only have (i) a first-priority security interest in any interest the Issuer has in the Escrowed
Property in the Escrow Account and (ii) a right to receive the Escrowed Property held in the Escrow Account plus
the Shortfall Redemption Amount if the Escrow Release Conditions are not satisfied, as described under
“Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.” Holders of the Notes will not
have any recourse to Syneos Health or its subsidiaries prior to the consummation of the Merger, and as a result, the
sole recourse of the holders of the Notes prior to the consummation of the Merger will be to the funds deposited in
the Escrow Account, and to the Sponsors’ commitment to pay the Shortfall Redemption Amount. Prior to the
release of the funds in the Escrow Account in accordance with the provisions of the escrow agreement, Syneos
Health and its restricted subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the covenants set forth in the indentures governing
the Notes.

**_If a bankruptcy or reorganization case is commenced, the Escrowed Property might be deemed to be property of_**
**_the bankruptcy estate such that bankruptcy laws may prevent the release of Escrowed Property in the Escrow_**
**_Account and the holders of the Notes might become unsecured creditors._**

If the Issuer commences a bankruptcy or reorganization case, or one is commenced against the Issuer,
while amounts remain in the applicable segregated Escrow Accounts as described under “Description of the
Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,” applicable bankruptcy laws may prevent the Escrow
Agent from releasing the Escrowed Property in the Escrow Account or applying those funds to effect a special
mandatory redemption or otherwise applying those funds for the benefit of the holders of such Notes. The court
adjudicating that case might find that the Escrow Account for the Notes is the property of the bankruptcy estate,
with or without restrictions on the use of such Escrowed Property by the bankruptcy estate. As a result, the holders
of such Notes could become unsecured creditors of the bankruptcy estate.

In addition, although the amounts in the Escrow Account for the Notes will be pledged to the Trustee on a
first priority basis as collateral for payment, if required, of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price, the automatic
stay provisions of the federal bankruptcy laws generally prohibit secured creditors from foreclosing upon or
disposing of a debtor’s property without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under the facts
and circumstances of any particular case). As a result, holders of the Notes may not be able to have the Escrowed
Property in the Escrow Account for such Notes applied at the time or in the manner contemplated by the indenture
governing the Notes and could suffer a loss.


-----

**_If the Merger is completed on or prior to the Escrow Outside Date and the Escrow Release Date occurs, the_**
**_proceeds from the Notes will be released from escrow even if a default or an event of default under the indenture_**
**_governing the Notes has or would have occurred and is continuing._**

The Escrowed Property will be released from escrow and utilized as described under “Use of Proceeds”
upon the Issuer’s delivery to the Escrow Agent and the Trustee of an officer’s certificate stating that the conditions
to the release of the proceeds from escrow have been satisfied. The Escrowed Property will be released from escrow
to consummate the Merger even if a default or an event of default under either the indenture governing the Notes
has or would have occurred and is continuing (or would have occurred had the Issuer and the guarantors been
subject to all of the provisions of the respective indentures from the issue date).

**_Between the time of the issuance of the Notes and the consummation of the Merger, the parties to the Merger_**
**_Agreement may agree to modify or waive the terms or conditions of such document without consent of the_**
**_holders of the Notes._**

Prior to the consummation of the Merger, the parties to the Merger Agreement may agree to amendments
or waivers of the terms thereof and holders of the Notes will not have the ability to veto any such actions. Although
no such amendment or waiver is presently contemplated, if the parties to the Merger Agreement decide to make
changes to the terms thereof (including to the purchase price) or to waive conditions thereunder, the holders of the
Notes will not be able to prevent the release of the Escrowed Property to fund the Merger as a result of any such
action and will not have any veto or consent rights in respect of any such actions.

**Risks Related to the Collateral Securing the Notes**

**_Even though the holders of the Notes will benefit from a first-priority lien on the Collateral, the representative of_**
**_the lenders under the New Credit Facilities will initially have the exclusive right to control actions (including the_**
**_exercise of remedies) with respect to the Collateral._**

The rights of the holders of the Notes in the Collateral (including the right to exercise remedies) will be
subject to the Intercreditor Agreement among the New Credit Agreement Collateral Agent, the Notes Collateral
Agent, the Trustee for the Notes and any applicable representative for the holders of future pari passu obligations.

Under the Intercreditor Agreement, any actions that may be taken with respect to the Shared Collateral,
including the ability to cause the commencement of enforcement proceedings against the Shared Collateral or to
control such proceedings, will be at the direction of the New Credit Agreement Collateral Agent until the earlier to
occur of (x) the discharge of our obligations under the New Credit Facilities (which discharge does not include
certain refinancings of the New Credit Facilities) and (y) 180 consecutive days after the occurrence of a continuing
event of default under an agreement governing a series of indebtedness that represents the largest outstanding
principal amount of indebtedness subject to the Intercreditor Agreement (other than the New Credit Facilities) and
the acceleration of such indebtedness (subject to certain other requirements). See “Description of the Notes—
Security for the Notes—Intercreditor Agreement.”

At any time that the New Credit Agreement Collateral Agent does not have the right to take action with
respect to the Collateral pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement as described above, then the authorized
representative for the Notes or other debt that has the greatest outstanding principal amount would exercise such
right to take action under the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement also includes waivers of certain
important rights that holders of secured debt would otherwise have.

The foregoing is not a summary of all material terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. For a more detailed
description, see “Description of the Notes—Security for the Notes—Intercreditor Agreement.”

Under the Intercreditor Agreement, none of the Notes Collateral Agent or the holders of the Notes may
object following the filing of a bankruptcy petition or commencement of any other insolvency, restructuring or
liquidation proceeding to (i) any proposed debtor-in-possession financing and/or to the use of cash collateral that is
not opposed or objected to by the controlling collateral agent or (ii) to the extent not opposed or objected to by the


-----

controlling collateral agent, the use of the Collateral to secure debtor in possession financing, in each case, subject to
certain specified conditions and limited exceptions. After the filing of any bankruptcy petition or the commencement
of any other insolvency, restructuring or liquidation proceeding, the value of the Collateral could materially
deteriorate, and holders of the Notes would be prohibited from raising an objection to such proposed financing or
use of cash collateral. For a description of important waivers by holders of the Notes and limits on their rights as
secured creditors under the Intercreditor Agreement see “Description of the Notes—Security for the Notes—
Intercreditor Agreement.”

**_Additional indebtedness may be secured by the Collateral that will secure the Notes, and the Notes will be secured_**
**_only to the extent of the value of the assets that have been granted as security for the Notes and the guarantees,_**
**_which may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Notes._**

The Notes will be secured by a first-priority lien on the Collateral, and there may not be sufficient
Collateral to pay all or any of the Notes. In addition, indebtedness permitted to be secured by a lien that is pari passu
with liens securing the Notes, including the New Credit Facilities (as described below) (referred to herein as other
“Additional Pari Passu Obligations”), is secured by the same tangible and intangible assets comprising the Collateral
securing the Notes, on a pari passu basis. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or
similar proceeding against us or any guarantor, the Collateral securing the other Additional Pari Passu Obligations
and the Notes must be used to pay the other Additional Pari Passu Obligations and the Notes ratably as set forth in
the Intercreditor Agreement. We may incur Additional Pari Passu Obligations in the future. Any Additional Pari
Passu Obligations incurred in the future will adversely affect the relative position of the holders of the Notes with
respect to the Collateral securing such Notes.

As of June 30, 2023, on a pro forma basis as described under “Capitalization,” we would have had
approximately $3,700 million principal amount of first lien secured indebtedness under the Notes and the New
Credit Facilities and approximately $485.8 million of additional borrowing capacity under the New Revolving
Facility (after taking into account $14.2 million of undrawn letters of credit issued thereunder), subject to customary
conditions.

No appraisals of any Collateral have been prepared in connection with the offering of the Notes. The value
of the Collateral at any time will depend on market and other economic conditions, including the availability of
suitable buyers for the Collateral. By their nature, some or all of the pledged assets may be illiquid and may have no
readily ascertainable market value. The value of the Collateral securing the Notes could be impaired in the future as
a result of changing economic conditions, our failure to implement our business strategy, competition and other
future events or trends. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, no assurance can
be given that the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the Collateral securing the Notes will be sufficient to pay
our obligations under the Notes, in full or at all, while also paying the Additional Pari Passu Obligations.

In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or similar proceeding against us or any
guarantor, all proceeds from the Collateral will be applied first to repay the obligations in respect of the Notes and
any other Additional Pari Passu Obligations. No assurance can be given that the proceeds from any sale or
liquidation of the Collateral will be sufficient to pay our obligations under the Notes, in full or at all, while also
paying the Additional Pari Passu Obligations.

Accordingly, there may not be sufficient Collateral to pay all or any of the amounts due on the Notes. Any
claim for the difference between the amount, if any, realized by holders of the Notes from the sale of the Collateral
securing the Notes and the obligations under the Notes will rank equally in right of payment with all of our other
unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness and other obligations, including trade payables.

**_Rights of holders of the Notes in the Collateral securing the Notes would generally be adversely affected by_**
**_bankruptcy proceedings._**

The right of the applicable collateral agent to repossess and dispose or otherwise realize upon of the
Collateral securing the Notes upon acceleration is likely to be significantly impaired (or at a minimum delayed) by
federal bankruptcy law if bankruptcy proceedings are commenced by or against us prior to or possibly even after the
applicable collateral agent has repossessed and disposed of the Collateral. Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a


-----

secured creditor, such as the applicable collateral agent, is prohibited from repossessing its security from a debtor in
a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security repossessed from a debtor, without prior bankruptcy court approval
(which may not be given under the facts and circumstances of a particular case).

Moreover, bankruptcy law permits the debtor to continue to retain and to use collateral (including cash
collateral), and the proceeds, products, rents or profits of the collateral, even if the debtor is in default under the
applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection.” The meaning of the
term “adequate protection” may vary according to circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the value of
the secured creditor’s interest in the collateral and may include cash payments or the granting of additional or
replacement security, if and at such time as the court in its discretion determines, for any diminution in the value of
the collateral as a result of the stay of repossession or disposition or any use of the collateral by the debtor during the
pendency of the bankruptcy case. In view of the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection” and
the broad discretionary powers of a bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under
the Notes could be made following the commencement of a bankruptcy case (or the length of the delay in making
any such payment), whether or when the applicable collateral agent would repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the
value of the Collateral as of the commencement of a bankruptcy case or at any point in time thereafter, or whether or
to what extent holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment of loss of value of the Collateral
through the requirements of “adequate protection” or otherwise. Furthermore, in the event the bankruptcy court
determines that the value of the Collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes and all of our debts
secured thereby on a senior or pari passu basis, the holders of the Notes would have “undersecured claims” as to the
difference and would not be entitled to post-petition interest, fees, or expenses or “adequate protection” with respect
to such difference. Federal bankruptcy laws do not permit the payment or accrual of interest, costs and fees to
creditors holding “undersecured claims” during the debtor’s bankruptcy case.

In addition, as described further above and in the Description of Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement will
limit the ability of the holders of the notes to raise certain objections following the commencement of any
bankruptcy case.

**_The Collateral securing the Notes may be diluted under certain circumstances._**

The Collateral that will secure the Notes will secure our obligations under the New Credit Facilities on a
_pari passu basis. This Collateral may secure on a first-priority basis additional senior indebtedness that we or certain_
of our subsidiaries incur in the future, subject to restrictions on our ability to incur debt and liens under the indenture
that will govern the Notes and the New Credit Agreement. Your rights to the Collateral would be diluted, and in
certain cases could be primed, by any increase in the indebtedness secured on a first-priority or parity basis by such
Collateral.

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes._**

The Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens
and other imperfections as may be accepted by the creditors that have the benefit of first liens on the Collateral
securing the Notes from time to time, whether on or after the date the Notes are issued. The initial purchasers did not
analyze the effect of, nor participate in, any negotiations relating to, such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens
and other imperfections. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections
could adversely affect the value of the Collateral securing the Notes as well as the ability of the applicable collateral
agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral.

In the event that a bankruptcy or other insolvency case is commenced by or against us, if the value of the
Collateral is less than the amount of principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes and all other Additional
Pari Passu Obligations, interest, fees, and expenses would generally cease to accrue on the Notes from and after the
date the bankruptcy petition is filed or other insolvency proceeding commenced.


-----

**_Certain laws and regulations may impose restrictions or limitations on foreclosure._**

Our obligations under the Notes and the guarantors’ obligations under the guarantees are secured only by
the Collateral described in this offering circular. The Notes Collateral Agent’s ability to foreclose on the Collateral
on behalf of the holders of the Notes may be subject to perfection, priority issues, state law requirements, applicable
bankruptcy law, and practical problems associated with the realization of the Notes Collateral Agent’s security
interest in or lien on the Collateral, including cure rights, foreclosing on the Collateral within the time periods
permitted by third parties or prescribed by laws, obtaining third-party consents, making additional filings, statutory
rights of redemption and the effect of the order of foreclosure. We cannot assure you that the consents of any third
parties and approvals by governmental entities or courts of competent jurisdiction will be given when required to
facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Therefore, we cannot assure you that foreclosure on the Collateral will be
sufficient to make all payments on the Notes.

**_The rights of holders of the Notes to the Collateral securing the Notes may be adversely affected by the failure to_**
**_perfect security interests in such Collateral and other issues generally associated with the realization of security_**
**_interests in Collateral._**

Applicable law requires that a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly
perfected and its priority retained through certain actions undertaken by the secured party including enforceability
vis-a-vis third parties upon registration before the relevant public registries. The liens on the Collateral securing the
Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if the applicable collateral agent is not able to
take the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens on or prior to the issue date of the Notes. Furthermore, the
indenture governing the Notes will contain customary exceptions to perfection actions that would be required to be
taken in order to perfect a security interest in certain types of Collateral. In addition, applicable law requires that
certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest, such as real property, can only be
perfected at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified and additional steps to perfect in such
property and rights are taken. If additional domestic restricted subsidiaries are formed or acquired and become
guarantors under the indenture that will govern the Notes, additional financing statements would be required to be
filed to perfect the security interest in the assets of such guarantors. Depending on the type of the assets constituting
after-acquired collateral, additional action may be required to be taken to perfect the security interest in such assets,
such as the delivery of physical collateral, if permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement, or the execution and
recordation of mortgages or deeds of trust. The Issuer and the guarantors will have limited obligations to perfect the
security interest of the holders of the Notes in the Collateral. There can be no assurance that the Trustee for the
Notes or the applicable collateral agent will monitor, or that we will inform such Trustee for the Notes or applicable
collateral agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute Collateral securing the Notes, and that
the necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired collateral. None of
the Trustee for the Notes, the Notes Collateral Agent or any other applicable collateral agent has any obligation to
monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that could constitute Collateral securing the Notes or monitor
the perfection of any security interest, or make any filings to perfect or maintain the perfection of any security
interest. This may result in the loss of the security interest in the Collateral securing the Notes or the priority of the
security interest in favor of the Notes against third parties. In addition, even if the Trustee or the Notes Collateral
Agent does properly perfect such security interests, any such security interests perfected after the issue date for the
Notes may potentially be avoidable as a preference in any bankruptcy proceeding under certain circumstances. See
“—Any future pledge of Collateral or guarantee provided after the Notes are issued might be avoided in a
bankruptcy.”

In addition, the security interest of the applicable collateral agent will be subject to practical challenges
generally associated with the realization of security interests in Collateral. For example, the applicable collateral
agent may need to obtain the consent of third parties and make additional filings. If we are unable to obtain these
consents or make these filings, the security interests may be invalid and the holders will not be entitled to the
affected Collateral or any recovery with respect thereto. We cannot assure you that the applicable collateral agent
will be able to obtain any such consent. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be
given when required to facilitate a foreclosure or other security enforcement on such assets. Accordingly, the
applicable collateral agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon or otherwise enforce against those assets and
the value of the affected Collateral may significantly decrease.


-----

**_The Collateral securing the Notes is subject to casualty risks._**

Although we maintain insurance policies to insure against losses, there are certain losses that may be either
uninsurable or not economically insurable, in whole or in part. As a result, it is possible that the insurance proceeds
will not compensate us fully for our losses in the event of a catastrophic loss. If there is a total or partial loss of any
of the Collateral, we cannot assure you that any insurance proceeds received by us will be sufficient to satisfy all the
secured obligations, including the Notes.

**_We will, in most cases, have control over the Collateral, and the sale of particular assets by us could reduce the_**
**_pool of assets securing the Notes and any future guarantees. In addition, certain assets, including Excluded_**
**_Assets, will be excluded from the Collateral._**

Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the New Credit Facilities, the security documents
allow us to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of
any income from, the Collateral. For example, so long as no default or event of default under the indenture that will
govern the Notes would result therefrom, we may, among other things, without any release or consent by the Trustee
for the Notes, conduct activities with respect to the Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise
disposing of the Collateral and making cash payments (including repayments of indebtedness). The lien on the
Collateral will be automatically released upon any permitted disposition thereof to a person that is not the issuer or
guarantor of the Notes. Any such actions could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes. See “Description of the
Notes.”

In addition, certain assets, including Excluded Assets, will be excluded from the Collateral. Some of these
assets may be material to us and such exclusion could have a material adverse effect on the value of the Collateral.
See “Description of the Notes—Security” for the definition of “Excluded Assets.”

**_Any future pledge of Collateral or guarantee provided after the Notes are issued might be avoided in a_**
**_bankruptcy._**

The indenture that will govern the Notes and the Collateral documents will require us to cause any
subsidiary that guarantees the New Credit Facilities to provide a guarantee of the Notes and will require us to cause
such guarantor to grant liens on certain assets that we or any such guarantor holds at the time the Notes are issued or
acquires after the Notes are issued. Any future guarantee or additional lien in favor of the applicable collateral
agents for the benefit of the holders of the Notes might be avoidable by the grantor (as debtor-in possession) or by a
trustee in bankruptcy or other third parties if certain events or circumstances exist or occur. For instance, if the entity
granting a future guarantee or additional lien was insolvent at the time of the grant and if such grant was made
within 90 days before that entity commenced a bankruptcy proceeding (or one year before commencement of a
bankruptcy proceeding if the creditor that benefited from the guarantee or lien is an “insider” under the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code), and the granting of the future guarantee or additional lien enabled the holders of the Notes to
receive more than they would if the grantor were liquidated under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, then such
guarantee or lien could be avoided as a preferential transfer. Liens recorded or perfected after the issue date may be
treated under bankruptcy law as if they were delivered to secure previously existing indebtedness. In bankruptcy
proceedings commenced within 90 days of lien perfection (or a potentially longer time period), a lien given to secure
previously existing indebtedness is materially more likely to be avoided as a preference by the bankruptcy court than
if delivered and promptly recorded on the issue date (or within a 30-day safe harbor provided for in the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code). Accordingly, if we or any guarantor of the Notes were to file for bankruptcy or other insolvency
protection after the issue date with respect to the Notes being offered hereby and the liens had been perfected less
than 90 days before the commencement of such bankruptcy proceeding (or potentially a longer period), the liens
securing the Notes may be particularly subject to challenge as a preference as a result of having been delivered after
the issue date of the Notes. To the extent that such challenge were to succeed, the holders of the Notes would lose
the benefit of the security that the Collateral was intended to provide.

**_Lien searches may not reveal all existing liens on the Collateral that will secure the Notes._**

We will conduct lien searches on the Collateral securing the Notes in the United States and cannot
guarantee that these lien searches will reveal all existing liens on such Collateral. Any existing undiscovered lien


-----

could be significant, could be prior in ranking to the liens securing the Notes or the guarantees and could have an
adverse effect on the ability of the applicable collateral agent to realize or foreclose upon the Collateral securing the
Notes. In addition, certain statutory priority liens may also exist that cannot or will not be discovered by lien
searches.

**_The imposition of certain permitted liens will, under certain circumstances, permit the liens on the related assets_**
**_securing the Notes and the related guarantees to be either subordinated to such permitted liens or released. There_**
**_are also certain other assets that are also excluded from the Collateral._**

The indenture that will govern the Notes will permit liens in favor of third parties to secure additional
indebtedness, including purchase money indebtedness and capital lease obligations, and, in the case of certain of
such liens, the liens on the related assets securing the Notes and the related guarantees may, under certain
circumstances, be either subordinated to such permitted liens or released. Our ability to incur additional
indebtedness and liens on such additional indebtedness in favor of third parties is subject to limitations as described
herein under the headings “Description of the Notes.” In addition, certain assets are excluded from the Collateral, as
discussed under “Description of the Notes—Security for the Notes.” If an event of default occurs and the maturity of
the Notes is accelerated, the Notes and the related guarantees will rank pari passu with the holders of other
unsecured indebtedness of the relevant obligor with respect to such excluded assets. As a result, if the value of the
assets pledged as security for the Notes is less than the value of the claims of the holders of the Notes, those claims
may not be satisfied in full before the claims of our unsecured creditors are paid.


-----

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes will be approximately $     , after
deducting the initial purchasers’ discount and other expenses payable by us. We intend to use the net proceeds from
the sale of the Notes offered hereby, together with borrowings under the New Credit Facilities, the Sponsor Equity
Investment and cash on hand, to (i) pay consideration in connection with the Merger and any other payments
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (ii) pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions,
(iii) consummate the Debt Refinancing and (iv) otherwise provide for working capital and general corporate
purposes.

Certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates are lenders under the Existing Credit Agreement and/or
holders of the Existing Notes. As a result, each of those initial purchasers or their affiliates will receive a portion of
the net proceeds from this offering. See “Plan of Distribution.”

The table below sets forth the estimated sources and uses of proceeds in connection with the Transactions,
assuming they occurred on June 30, 2023 and based on amounts outstanding on that date. You should read the
following together with the information included under the headings “Summary—The Transactions,”
“Capitalization” and “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information” included elsewhere in
this offering circular. Actual amounts are likely to differ from the estimated amounts shown below.

**UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

The following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2023 and the
unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023,
the six months ended June 30, 2023, the six months ended June 30, 2022 and the fiscal year ended December 31,
2022 are based on the historical consolidated audited annual and unaudited interim financial statements of Syneos
Health included elsewhere in this offering circular. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet
gives effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on June 30, 2023. The unaudited pro forma condensed
consolidated statements of operations give effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on January 1, 2022, the
earliest period presented, for purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations.

The unaudited pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions that we
believe are reasonable under the circumstances. This unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial
information has been prepared to give effect to transactions that have occurred or are probable for which disclosure
of pro forma financial information would be material to investors, as described in the notes below.

The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information herein has been adjusted to reflect
the impacts of the Transactions including the following:

      - Transaction Accounting Adjustments. This represents pro forma adjustments to reflect the
application of the accounting required by GAAP, giving effect to the Merger in the historical
consolidated financial statements.

      - Financing and Other Adjustments. This represents pro forma adjustments to reflect financing of
the Merger including the Sponsor Equity Investment, debt financing, and the repayment of
outstanding borrowings.

We elected not to present the reasonably estimable cost savings, synergies, and other transaction effects
that have occurred or are reasonably expected to occur (“Management’s Adjustments”) in the unaudited pro forma
condensed consolidated financial information. See “Summary—Summary Historical and Unaudited Pro Forma
Condensed Consolidated Financial Information” for a discussion of Management’s Adjustments.

The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information are presented for informational
purposes only and do not purport to represent what our actual consolidated statements of operations or consolidated
balance sheet would have been had the Transactions actually occurred on the dates indicated, nor are they
necessarily indicative of future consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial condition. The unaudited
pro forma condensed consolidated financial information should be read in conjunction with the information
contained in “Summary—The Transactions” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations,” as well as the historical consolidated financial statements and the related noted included
elsewhere in this offering circular. All pro forma adjustments and their underlying assumptions are described more
fully in the notes to our unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information. In the opinion of
management, the unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma financial information includes all adjustments
necessary to present a fair statement of the pro forma financial information.

The Merger will be accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting in
accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”). The acquisition method of accounting requires use
of the fair value concepts defined in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements (“ASC 820”). ASC 820 defines fair value
as “the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date.” The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial
information presented herein, including the allocation of the purchase price, is based on preliminary estimates of the
fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, available information as of the date of this offering circular
and the Issuer’s assumptions, and will be revised as additional information becomes available. The final purchase
price allocation is dependent on, among other things, the completion of the asset and liability valuations. The actual
purchase price allocation will vary from the pro forma adjustments based on final analyses of the valuation of assets
acquired and liabilities assumed, particularly in regard to definite-lived tangible assets and deferred tax assets and
liabilities, which could be material. We will finalize the accounting for the Merger as soon as practicable within the


-----

measurement period in accordance with ASC 805, but in no event later than one year from the Merger date.
Historical and pro forma earnings per share have not been presented because we do not believe such information is
relevant to prospective investors of the Notes. Amounts included below may not add due to rounding. The unaudited
pro forma condensed consolidated financial information and related notes are provided for illustrative purposes only
and do not purport to represent what the combined company’s actual results of operations or financial position
would have been had the Merger been completed on the dates indicated, nor are they necessarily indicative of the
combined company’s future results of operations or financial position for any period.

**Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet**

1. Represents the historical balance sheet of Syneos Health as of June 30, 2023.

2. Represents the Transaction Accounting Adjustments, giving effect to the Merger, as follows:

a. Reflects the impact on cash associated with the Merger:

Cash component of purchase price (i) (also see note (b) below) $4,484.0
Merger-related expenses (ii) 91.7
Compensation-related payments (iii) 41.3
Total pro forma impact on cash $4,617.0

i. Represents the cash component of the purchase consideration based on the number of shares of
common stock issued and outstanding at $43 per share.

ii. Represents payment of $91.7 million of estimated transaction fees related to the Merger, which
will be expensed in the fiscal quarter in which the Merger is consummated.

iii. Represents payments that will be made to certain employees in connection with the Merger. These
compensation-related payments require specified periods of continued service after the Merger.
The offset to the cash payments is reflected as an adjustment to prepaid expenses and other current
assets and will be recorded as an expense over the required service periods. These amounts must
be repaid if the required service periods are not met.

The outstanding unvested Company Compensatory Awards have been cancelled and converted into rights
to receive cash upon completion of original vesting terms. The estimated fair value of the portion of these
awards where service has been completed prior to the closing of the Merger is $26.5 million and is
reflected in the preliminary purchase price. The offset has been recorded in accrued expenses on the pro
forma balance sheet.

b. Reflects the preliminary purchase price allocation to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in
the Merger, using the acquisition method of accounting. The preliminary allocation is summarized as
follows:

**Preliminary purchase price (in millions)**
Cash consideration paid for Syneos’ common shares outstanding (see note (a) above) $ 4,484.0
Consideration related to Company Compensatory Awards (i) 26.5
**Preliminary purchase price** $ 4,510.5

i. The outstanding unvested Company Compensatory Awards have been cancelled and converted
into rights to receive cash upon completion of original vesting terms. The estimated fair value of
the portion of these awards where service has been completed prior to the closing of the Merger is
$26.5 million and is reflected in the preliminary purchase price. The offset has been recorded in
accrued expenses on the pro forma balance sheet. The liability associated with the portion of the
Company Compensatory Awards related to future services, which is estimated at $120.5 million,
will be recorded over the corresponding service periods as compensation expense.

The preliminary purchase price is subject to change based on the closing date of the Merger and
the portion of the Company Compensatory Awards for which the service periods have been
completed at the time of the Merger.

ii. Represents the historical book value of the assets and liabilities as of June 30, 2023, which has
been assumed to be reflective of fair value based on the nature of the assets and liabilities and the
availability of information. This assessment has been based on information available at this time
and is subject to change.

iii. Reflects the preliminary fair value adjustment relating to identifiable intangible assets, which is
based on comparable industry transactions. The preliminary fair values and estimated useful lives
of Syneos’ identifiable intangible assets are as follows:


**Weighted**

**Fair value** **average useful**
**(in millions)** **life (years)**

Identifiable intangible assets
Customer relationships $ 1,769.3 20.0
Backlog 243.8 3.0
Trade names 103.6 3.0
Total $ 2,116.7 17.2
Less: Intangible assets as of June 30, 2023 (608.4)

-----

iv. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of
identifiable assets acquired, less liabilities assumed, and primarily represents an assembled
workforce acquired and other intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition.

v. Reflects the adjustment in deferred tax liability for the temporary difference between the book and
tax basis as a result of the preliminary purchase price allocation. A blended statutory rate of each
asset’s legal jurisdiction was used in establishing the deferred tax liability.

vi. Reflects adjustments to recognize our existing debt outstanding under the Existing Credit
Agreement and the Existing Notes at fair value in accordance with GAAP, including the
elimination of the existing unamortized discount and debt issuance costs.

vii. Reflects the adjustment to remove the historical debt issuance costs on Syneos’ Existing
Revolving Facility.

viii. Represents the assumption of estimated seller transaction costs that were not included in accrued
expenses as of June 30, 2023 but will become payable in connection with the closing of the
Merger.

c. Reflects the elimination of existing stockholders’ equity of $3,493.7 million and the recognition of
estimated transaction costs of approximately $91.7 million.

3. Represents the Financing and other material pro forma adjustments, as follows:

a. Reflects the net increase in cash as a result of the Sponsor Equity Investment of $3,990.0 million, the net
proceeds from the issuance of the Notes offered hereby of $1,700.0 million and borrowings under the New
Term Facility of $2,000.0 million, offset by the repayment of the debt outstanding under the Existing Credit
Agreement, the Existing Notes, and the Receivables Financing Agreement of $2,659.0 million in principal,
the cash received on the termination of the interest rate swaps of $9.9 million and the payment of estimated
debt issuance costs of $207.4 million.

b. Represents the removal of interest rate swaps due to termination of such swaps, including $9.0 million
recorded within prepaid expenses and other current assets and $0.9 million recorded within other long-term
assets.

c. Represents the commitment fee on the undrawn New Revolving Facility of $0.4 million, which is recorded
within Other long-term assets.

d. Represents the repayment of debt outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement, the Existing Notes, and
the Receivables Financing Agreement of $2,659.0 million and the issuance of the New Term Facility and
the Notes offered hereby in an aggregate principal amount of $3,700.0 million, net of the related debt
issuance costs of $207.0 million.

e. Represents amounts invested directly or indirectly in equity securities of Holdings by funds affiliated with
or controlled by the Sponsor and certain co-investors of $3,990.0 million.

As discussed above, the Merger will be accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition
method of accounting, which will establish a new basis of accounting for assets acquired and liabilities
assumed at fair value; however the effects from the application of the acquisition method of accounting
relating to the acquisition of Syneos, including fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities
assumed, are preliminary in nature. Fair values have been determined based on internal information
provided, specific to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The preliminary estimates were based on a
benchmarking analysis of similar transactions in the industry to identify value allocations of Merger


-----

consideration to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including intangible assets. Upon completion of the
Merger, a final determination of fair value of Syneos’ assets and liabilities will be made. The final
allocation of purchase price may be materially different than that reflected in the preliminary allocation of
purchase price presented herein. Any increase or decrease in fair values of the net assets as compared with
the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information may change the amount of the total
Merger consideration allocated to goodwill and other assets and liabilities and may impact the unaudited
pro forma condensed consolidated statements of income due to adjustments in the amortization expense of
the intangible assets.

**Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations**

1. Represents the historical statements of operations of Syneos Health for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023,
the six months ended June 30, 2023, the six months ended June 30, 2022, and the year ended December 31,
2022. The historical statement of operations of Syneos Health for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 was
derived by adding the statements of operations data for the year ended December 31, 2022 and the six months
ended June 30, 2023, and subtracting the statement of operations data for the six months ended June 30, 2022.

2. Represents the Transaction Accounting Adjustments, giving effect to the Merger, as follows:

a. Reflects incremental amortization resulting from the adjustment of certain Syneos Health assets to fair
value in connection with acquisition accounting, including incremental expense resulting from the
amortization of identifiable finite-lived intangible assets. In addition, changes in the useful lives of the
identified intangible assets could materially impact amortization expense upon finalization. For each 10%
increase or decrease in the preliminary fair value of finite-lived intangible assets, annual amortization
expense would increase or decrease by approximately $33.3 million. Finite-lived intangible assets are
amortized using an expected benefits method of amortization. The estimated weighted average useful life
of the pro forma finite-lived intangible assets is 17.2 years. The pro forma amortization expense over the
first five year period following the Merger is $1,161.3 million. A one-year reduction in the weighted
average useful life of the finite-lived intangible assets would result in an additional $17.7 million of
amortization expense over the first five year period following the Merger.

b. Represents $21.3 million of cash payments to be made to certain employees after the close of the Merger
whose terms require continued employment through the first anniversary of the Merger. This cash payment
has been reflected as an expense recognized ratably over the twelve month vesting period on a pro forma
basis. Expense related to these cash payments of $21.3 million is recognized on a pro forma basis during
the year ended December 31, 2022, $10.6 million is recognized on a pro forma basis during the six months
ended June 30, 2022, and $10.6 million is recognized on a pro forma basis during the twelve months ended
June 30, 2023. Such costs will be incurred or expected to be incurred related to the Merger subsequent to
June 30, 2023. These costs will not affect the statements of operations beyond twelve months after the
acquisition date.

c. Represents additional fees and expenses anticipated to be incurred related to advisory fees, sponsors fees,
other transactional costs, and legal, accounting, and other professional fees and expenses of $91.7 million
on a pro forma basis during the year ended December 31, 2022 and the six months ended June 30, 2022 as
well as ongoing annual management fees payable to the Sponsors each quarter beginning one quarter after
the close of the Merger. The ongoing management fee of $15.0 million is recognized on a pro forma basis
during the year ended December 31, 2022, $5.0 million is recognized on a pro forma basis during the six
months ended June 30, 2022, $10.0 million is recognized on a pro forma basis during the six months ended
June 30, 2023, and $20.0 million is recognized on a pro forma basis during the twelve months ended June
30, 2023. A significant portion of this adjustment will not impact the statement of operations beyond the
twelve months from the date of the Merger.


-----

d. A Syneos Health blended statutory rate was used for each period presented above to reflect the estimated
tax effect of the pro forma adjustments.

3. Represents the Financing and other material pro forma adjustments, as follows:

a. Represents pro forma impact on interest expense determined as follows (in millions):

**Twelve** **Six** **Six**
**months** **months** **months** **Year**
**ended** **ended** **ended** **ended**

Total impact to pro forma
interest expense $ (268.9) $ (126.6) $ (156.1) $ (298.4)

The interest rates for pro forma purposes are based on the rates assumed to be effective upon the closing of
the Transactions. The interest rate applied to the borrowings under the New Credit Facilities is based on
SOFR (as defined elsewhere in this offering circular), which may cause the interest rate estimate applied in
the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations to vary, depending on
fluctuations in market interest rates. Deferred financing fees related to the New Credit Facilities and Notes
are amortized over the term of the debt that they relate to. After giving effect to the Transactions, each
0.125% change in assumed blended interest rates would result in an approximately $2.5 million change in
annual interest expense on indebtedness under the New Credit Facilities. The foregoing pro forma interest
expense information does not give effect to any future hedging strategies.

b. A Syneos Health blended statutory rate was used for each period presented above to reflect the estimated
tax effect of the pro forma adjustments.

**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF**
**OPERATIONS**

_You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations_
_in conjunction with our audited and unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto_
_included elsewhere in this offering circular. In addition to historical condensed consolidated financial information,_
_this offering circular contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation_
_Reform Act of 1995 that reflect, among other things, our current expectations and anticipated results of operations,_
_all of which are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual_
_results, performance or achievements, market trends, or industry results to differ materially from those expressed or_
_implied by such forward-looking statements. Therefore, any statements contained herein that are not statements of_
_historical fact may be forward-looking statements and should be evaluated as such. We caution you that any such_
_forward-looking statements are further qualified by important factors that could cause our actual operating results_
_to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including those described under “Risk Factors.”_
_See “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in this offering circular._

**Overview of Our Business and Services**

We are a leading fully integrated biopharmaceutical solutions organization built to accelerate customer success. We
translate unique clinical, medical affairs and commercial insights into outcomes to address modern market realities.

Our operations are divided into two reportable segments, Clinical Solutions and Commercial Solutions. Our
Clinical Solutions segment offers comprehensive global services for the development of diagnostics, drugs,
biologics, devices, and digital therapeutics that span Phases I to IV of clinical development. Our Commercial
Solutions segment provides commercialization services, including field team deployment solutions,
communications services (public relations, advertising, and medical communications), and consulting services. We
integrate our clinical and commercial capabilities into customized solutions by sharing knowledge, data, and
insights. This collaboration across the development and commercialization continuum facilitates unique insights
into patient populations, therapeutic environments, product timelines, and the competitive landscape. For further
discussion, refer to “Note 11 – Segment Information” to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
included in this offering circular.

We are pursuing business transformation initiatives to improve customer engagement, increase innovation, and
achieve operating efficiencies. However, in connection with the pendency of the Merger, we have suspended
certain aspects of these initiatives and, accordingly, we may not incur previously anticipated material costs in
connection with such initiatives. These initiatives, if implemented, may not yield their intended improvements, or
be completed in a timely manner, which may impact our competitiveness and our ability to meet our growth
objectives and, as a result, materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.
For a further discussion of these and other risks relating to our business, refer to the section entitled “Risk Factors–
Risks Related to Our Business” in this offering circular.

**Proposed Merger**

On May 10, 2023, the Company entered into the Merger Agreement with the Issuer, an affiliated entity of the
Sponsors, and Merger Sub, pursuant to which, at the Effective Time, the Company will become a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Issuer and each share of Class A common stock of the Company issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled and extinguished and, except for limited exceptions,
automatically converted into the right to receive $43.00 in cash. At a special meeting held on August 2, 2023, our
stockholders approved the Merger. If the Merger is consummated, our shares of Class A common stock will no
longer trade on Nasdaq and will be deregistered under the Exchange Act. As a result, we will become a private
company. Completion of the Merger is expected in the second half of 2023, subject to the satisfaction of certain
customary closing conditions, including pending regulatory approvals.

As of June 30, 2023, we had incurred approximately $23.0 million of costs in connection with the Merger and
expect to continue to incur significant costs and expenses, including fees for professional services and other
transaction costs.

For additional information regarding the terms of the proposed Merger, see “Summary—The Transactions” and
“Risk Factors” in this offering circular and “Note 1 – Basis of Presentation” to our unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements included in this offering circular.

**New Business Awards and Backlog**

We add new business awards to backlog when we enter into a contract or when we receive a written commitment
from the customer selecting us as a service provider, provided that:

    - collection of the award value is probable;

    - the project or projects are expected to commence within a certain period of time from the end of the
quarter in which the award was granted;

    - project contingencies such as the outcome of other clinical trials, funding approvals, or other events,
are not anticipated to prevent the project or projects from commencing in accordance with the expected
timeline;

    - the customer has entered or intends to enter into a comprehensive contract as soon as practicable; and

    - for awards related to deployment solutions and functional service provider offerings, a maximum of
twelve months of services are included in the award value.

In addition, we continually evaluate our backlog to determine if any of the previously awarded work is no longer
expected to be performed, regardless of whether we have received formal cancellation notice from the customer. If
we determine that any previously awarded work is no longer probable of being performed, we remove the value
from our backlog based on the risk of cancellation. We recognize revenue from these awards as services are
performed, provided we have received proper authorization from the customer.

We report new business awards for our Clinical Solutions and Commercial Solutions segments on a trailing twelve
months (“TTM”) basis. Our total backlog represents backlog for our Clinical Solutions segment and the deployment
solutions offering within our Commercial Solutions segment. We do not report backlog for the remaining service
offerings in the Commercial Solutions segment.

**_Backlog_**

Our backlog consists of anticipated future revenue from business awards that either have not started, or that are in
process and have not been completed. Our backlog also reflects any cancellation or adjustment activity related to
these awards. The average duration of our contracts will fluctuate from period to period based on the contracts
comprising our backlog at any given time. The majority of our contracts contain early termination provisions that
typically require notice periods ranging from 30 to 90 days.

Our backlog as of the dates for the periods presented below was as follows (in millions):

**June 30,** **December 31,**
**2023** **2022** **2022** **2021**
Clinical Solutions $8,862.1 $10,634.4 $9,262.7 $10,569.0
Commercial Solutions - Deployment Solutions 786.5 821.6 865.9 860.3
Total backlog $9,648.6 $11,456.0 $10,128.6 $11,429.3

The table above is presented to include reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses. Reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses
for our Clinical Solutions segment were $3,012.9 as of June 30, 2023, $3,200.5 as of December 31, 2022, $3,654.2
as of June 30, 2022 and $3,795.7 as of December 31, 2021.

We expect approximately $2.16 billion of our backlog as of June 30, 2023 will be recognized as revenue during the
remainder of 2023. We adjust the amount of our backlog each quarter for the effects of fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates.


-----

**_Net New Business Awards_**

New business awards, net of cancellations, for the TTM periods presented below were as follows (in millions):

**TTM Ended** **TTM Ended**

**June 30,** **December 31,**

**2023** **2022** **2022** **2021** **2020**
Clinical Solutions $2,270.4 $3,901.5 $2,841.6 $4,372.9 $4,742.0
Commercial Solutions 1,368.4 1,400.3 1,382.1 1,359.8 1,121.1
Total net new business awards $3,638.8 $5,301.8 $4,223.7 $5,732.7 $5,863.1

New business awards have varied and may continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter. Fluctuations in our
net new business award levels often result from the fact that we may receive a small number of relatively large
orders in any given reporting period. Because of these large orders, our backlog and net new business awards in a
reporting period may reach levels that are not sustainable in subsequent reporting periods.

We have experienced increased flow of requests for proposal (“RFP flow”) in the first half of 2023 compared to the
second half of 2022 in both our Clinical Solutions and Commercial Solutions segments. In Clinical Solutions, the
increased RFP flow was primarily driven by large pharmaceutical companies, with RFP flow from small to midsized (“SMID”) companies remaining relatively consistent. In Commercial Solutions, the increased RFP flow was
driven by both large pharmaceutical and SMID companies. Additionally, net new business awards have been, and
we expect will continue to be affected by the broad effects of the current macroeconomic environment on the global
economy and major financial markets, including but not limited to interest rate increases and inflation.

We believe that our backlog and net new business awards might not be consistent indicators of future revenue for a
variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, changes to the scope of work during the course of projects,
including the variable size and duration of projects, and our ability to win repeat business. Additionally, projects
may be canceled or delayed by the customer or regulatory authorities. We generally do not have a contractual right
to the full amount of the awards reflected in our backlog. If a customer cancels an award, we might be reimbursed
for the costs we have incurred. As we increasingly compete for and enter into large contracts that are more global in
nature, the rate at which our backlog and net new business awards convert into revenue may decrease, and the
duration of projects and the period over which related revenue is recognized may lengthen. For more information
about risks related to our net new business awards and backlog, see “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business –
Our backlog might not be indicative of our future revenues, and we might not realize all of the anticipated future
revenue reflected in our backlog” and “ – If we do not generate a sufficient number of new business awards, or if
new business awards are delayed, terminated, reduced in scope, or fail to go to contract, our business, financial
condition, results of operations, or cash flows may be materially adversely affected.”

Net (loss) income $ (71,356) 123,920 (195,276) n/m

**_Revenue_**

For the six months ended June 30, 2023, our revenue increased by $25.9 million, or 1.0%, to $2,722.9 million from
$2,697.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. The increase was primarily driven by higher reimbursable
out-of-pocket expenses, partially offset by decreased project start-ups in Clinical Solutions.


-----

No single customer accounted for greater than 10% of our total consolidated revenue for the six months ended June
30, 2023 and 2022. Revenue from our top five customers accounted for approximately 25% of revenue for the six
months ended June 30, 2023, and 23% of revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2022.

Revenue for each of our segments was as follows (dollars in thousands):

**Six Months Ended June 30,**
**2023** **% of total** **2022** **% of total** **Change**
Clinical Solutions $ 2,035,457 74.8% $ 2,044,085 75.8% $ (8,628) (0.4)%
Commercial Solutions 687,423 25.2% 652,907 24.2% 34,516 5.3%
Total revenue $ 2,722,880 $ 2,696,992 $ 25,888 1.0%

_Clinical Solutions_

For the six months ended June 30, 2023, revenue attributable to our Clinical Solutions segment decreased compared
to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by lower project start-ups, partially offset by higher
reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses. Compared to the same period in the prior year, fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates negatively impacted revenue by $6.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023.

_Commercial Solutions_

For the six months ended June 30, 2023, revenue attributable to our Commercial Solutions segment increased
compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by higher reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses. For
the six months ended June 30, 2023, revenue was negatively impacted by $5.6 million from fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates compared to the same period in the prior year.

**_Direct Costs_**

Direct costs consist principally of compensation expense and benefits associated with our employees and other
employee-related costs, and reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses directly related to delivering on our projects.
While we have some ability to manage the majority of these costs relative to the amount of contracted services we
have during any given period, direct costs as a percentage of revenue can vary from period to period. Such
fluctuations are due to a variety of factors, including, among others: (i) the level of staff utilization on our projects;
(ii) adjustments to the timing of work on specific customer contracts; (iii) the experience mix of personnel assigned
to projects; (iv) the service mix and pricing of our contracts; and (v) the timing of the incurrence of reimbursable
out-of-pocket expenses.

Direct costs were as follows (dollars in thousands):

**Six Months Ended June 30,**

**2023** **2022** **Change**
Direct costs (exclusive of depreciation and

amortization) $ 2,159,912 $ 2,079,329 $ 80,583 3.9%
_% of revenue_ _79.3%_ _77.1%_
_Gross margin %_ _20.7%_ _22.9%_

For the six months ended June 30, 2023, our direct costs increased by $80.6 million, or 3.9%, compared to the six
months ended June 30, 2022.

Direct costs for our Clinical Solutions segment, excluding share-based compensation expense, were as follows
(dollars in thousands):

**Six Months Ended June 30,**

**2023** **2022** **Change**
Direct costs $ 1,564,830 $ 1,528,119 $ 36,711 2.4%
_% of segment revenue_ _76.9%_ _74.8%_
_Segment gross margin %_ _23.1%_ _25.2%_

For the six months ended June 30, 2023, our Clinical Solutions segment direct costs increased by $36.7 million, or
2.4%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2022. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, the increase was
primarily driven by higher reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses and personnel costs, partially offset by positive
impacts from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

Gross margins for our Clinical Solutions segment were 23.1% and 25.2% for the six months ended June 30, 2023
and 2022, respectively. Gross margin was lower during the current year period as compared to the same period in
the prior year primarily due to increased personnel costs and higher reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses, partially
offset by positive impacts from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

_Commercial Solutions_

Direct costs for our Commercial Solutions segment, excluding share-based compensation expense, were as follows
(dollars in thousands):

**Six Months ended June 30,**

**2023** **2022** **Change**
Direct costs $ 572,946 $ 534,543 $ 38,403 7.2%
_% of segment revenue_ _83.3%_ _81.9%_
_Segment gross margin %_ _16.7%_ _18.1%_

For the six months ended June 30, 2023, our Commercial Solutions segment direct costs increased by $38.4
million, or 7.2%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2022. These increase was primarily driven by higher
reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses.

Gross margins for our Commercial Solutions segment were 16.7% and 18.1% for the six months ended June 30,
2023 and 2022, respectively. Gross margin was lower during the current year period as compared to the same
period in the prior year primarily due to higher reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses and a less favorable revenue
mix, driven by new deployments of field teams.

**_Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses_**

Selling, general, and administrative expenses were as follows (dollars in thousands):

**Six Months ended June 30,**

**2023** **2022** **Change**
Selling, general, and administrative

expenses $ 344,040 $ 279,206 $ 64,834 23.2%
_% of total revenue_ _12.6%_ _10.4%_

Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2023 increased compared to the
same period in 2022 primarily due to higher transaction, integration-related, and other expenses, driven by our
business transformation initiatives and the Merger, and higher bad debt expense, driven by specific client reserves.


-----

**_Restructuring and Other Costs_**

Restructuring and other costs were $95.3 million and $24.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and
2022, respectively. The costs incurred during the six months ended June 30, 2023 were primarily related to our real
estate optimization initiative to close or reduce office space that is no longer being utilized. For the six months
ended June 30, 2023, this includes $56.7 million of accelerated amortization of operating lease right-of-use assets
and $18.3 million of accelerated depreciation of property and equipment, both of which are non-cash expenses.

Restructuring and other costs consisted of the following (in thousands):

**Six Months ended June 30,**

**2023** **2022** **Change**
Employee severance and benefit costs $ 15,749 $ 17,188 $ (1,439) (8.4)%
Leased facility closure and related costs 79,116 3,352 75,764 2,260.3%
Other costs 463 4,000 (3,537) (88.4)%
Total restructuring and other costs $ 95,328 $ 24,540 $ 70,788 288.5%

We expect to continue to incur costs related to our business transformation initiatives during the remainder of 2023
and beyond as we continue the ongoing evaluations of our global workforce and facilities infrastructure needs to
improve customer engagement, increase innovation, and achieve operating efficiencies.

**_Depreciation and Amortization Expense_**

Total depreciation and amortization expense was $120.9 million and $123.4 million for the six months ended June
30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in total depreciation and amortization expense in the current year
compared to the prior year period was primarily due to fully amortized intangible assets from prior acquisitions,
partially offset by amortization expense from internal-use software. Accelerated amortization and depreciation
expense related to our real estate optimization initiative are included in restructuring and other costs in our
condensed consolidated statements of operations.

**_Total Other Expense, Net_**

Total other expense, net consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):

**Six Months ended June 30,**

**2023** **2022** **Change**
Interest income $ (2,236) $ (39) $ (2,197) (5,633.3)%
Interest expense 64,664 33,867 30,797 90.9%
Other expense (income), net 14,754 (510) 15,264 n/m
Total other expense, net $ 77,182 $ 33,318 $ 43,864 131.7%

Total other expense, net was $77.2 million and $33.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022,
respectively. The increase in total other expense, net in the current year compared to the prior year period was
primarily driven by an increase in interest expense primarily due to increased interest rates on variable rate debt.
Due to higher variable interest rates, we expect to continue to experience higher interest expense during the
remainder of 2023. Other expense (income), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses that result
from exchange rate fluctuations on our monetary asset balances denominated in currencies other than our functional
currency and other gains and losses related to investments.

**_Income Tax (Benefit) Expense_**

For the six months ended June 30, 2023, we recorded income tax benefit of $3.1 million on a pre-tax loss of $74.5
million. The income tax benefit for the six months ended June 30, 2023 included discrete tax expense of $6.5
million, primarily related to tax shortfalls from share-based compensation. The effective tax rate for the six months
ended June 30, 2023, excluding discrete items, varied from the United States (“U.S.”) federal statutory income tax
rate of 21.0% primarily due to foreign tax credits, foreign income inclusions such as the Global Intangible LowTaxed Income (“GILTI”) provisions, and research and development credits.


-----

For the six months ended June 30, 2022, we recorded income tax expense of $33.3 million on pre-tax income of
$157.2 million. Income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2022 included discrete tax benefits of $6.4
million, primarily related to excess tax benefits from share-based compensation. The effective tax rate for the six
months ended June 30, 2022, excluding discrete items, varied from the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of
21.0% primarily due to state and local taxes on U.S. income, foreign income inclusions such as the Global
Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) provisions, and research and development credits.

We currently maintain a valuation allowance against a portion of our state deferred tax assets and a portion of our
foreign deferred tax assets as of June 30, 2023. We intend to continue to maintain a valuation allowance on these
deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these
allowances.

**Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to the Year Ended December 31,**
**2021**

The following table sets forth amounts from our consolidated financial statements along with dollar and

**_Revenue_**

For the year ended December 31, 2022, our revenue increased by $180.1 million, or 3.5%, to $5.39 billion from
$5.21 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily driven by growth from
increased project start-ups in both our Clinical Solutions and Commercial Solutions segments partially offset by
lower reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses in our Clinical Solutions segment.

No single customer accounted for greater than 10% of our total consolidated revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2022 or 2021. Revenue from our top five customers accounted for approximately 24% and 22%
of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Revenue for each of our segments was as follows (dollars in thousands):

**Change**
**2022** **2021** **2020** **2022 to 2021** **2021 to 2020**
**Clinical Solutions** $ 4,070,618 $ 4,017,725 $ 3,346,208 $ 52,893 1.3% 671,517 20.1%

-----

_Clinical Solutions_

For the year ended December 31, 2022, revenue attributable to our Clinical Solutions segment increased
compared to the prior year, primarily driven by increased project start-ups related to large pharmaceutical
customers and, to a lesser extent, recent acquisitions. This increase was partially offset by decreases in revenue
from projects related to COVID-19, which generally experience higher reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, revenue was negatively impacted by $98.7 million from fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates compared to the prior year.

The war in Ukraine has not had a material impact on our revenue; however, that could change depending on the
magnitude of the conflict and the imposition of additional sanctions by the U.S. and other countries. We continue
to adapt our strategic approach as the crisis persists and we are continuing our risk assessments in neighboring
countries to be proactive about potential future challenges. Banking and economic sanctions imposed on Russia
continue to present challenges to clinical trials. We are monitoring these sanctions to ensure we are in compliance
and we are adapting our operations to address both the sanctions and the increasing logistical challenges of
conducting trials in Russia. At this time, we are continuing to service patients in Ukraine and Russia in existing
trials where possible. Any impacts to our revenue are expected to be temporary in nature as we work with
customers to explore alternate sources of recruiting new patients, including potentially activating sites in other
regions.

_Commercial Solutions_

For the year ended December 31, 2022, revenue attributable to our Commercial Solutions segment increased
compared to the prior year, primarily driven by increased project start-ups, including new deployments of field
teams, and higher reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2022, revenue was
negatively impacted by $22.8 million from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the prior
year.

**_Direct Costs_**

Direct costs consist principally of compensation expense and benefits associated with our employees and other
employee-related costs, and reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses directly related to delivering on our projects.
While we have some ability to manage the majority of these costs relative to the amount of contracted services we
have during any given period, direct costs as a percentage of revenue can vary from period to period. Such
fluctuations are due to a variety of factors, including, among others: (i) the level of staff utilization on our projects;
(ii) adjustments to the timing of work on specific customer contracts; (iii) the experience mix of personnel assigned
to projects; (iv) the service mix and pricing of our contracts; and (v) the timing of the incurrence of reimbursable
out-of-pocket expenses. Relative to pre-pandemic levels, we continue to experience reduced travel and other
reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses related to lower physical monitoring visits for Clinical Solutions, as well as
fewer field team visits to healthcare providers and investigator meetings for Commercial Solutions. As discussed
above, we expect reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses to remain lower relative to pre-pandemic levels.


-----

Direct costs were as follows (dollars in thousands):

**Change**
**2022** **2021** **2020** **2022 to 2021** **2021 to 2020**
Direct costs (exclusive of

depreciation and amortization) $ 4,138,816 $ 3,994,484 $ 3,398,142 $ 144,332 3.6% $ 596,342 17.5%
% of revenue 76.7% 76.6% 77.0%
Gross margin % 23.3% 23.4% 23.0%

For the year ended December 31, 2022, our direct costs increased by $144.3 million, or 3.6%, compared to the
year ended December 31, 2021.
_Clinical Solutions_

Direct costs for our Clinical Solutions segment, excluding share-based compensation expense, were as follows
(dollars in thousands):

**Change**
**2022** **2021** **2020** **2022 to 2021** **2021 to 2020**
Direct costs $ 3,027,509 $ 3,013,955 $ 2,519,465 $ 13,554 0.4% $ 494,490 19.6%
% of segment revenue 74.4% 75.0% 75.3%
Segment gross margin % 25.6% 25.0% 24.7%

For the year ended December 31, 2022, our Clinical Solutions segment direct costs increased by $13.6 million, or
0.4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily driven by increased billable
headcount to support revenue growth, partially offset by positive impacts from fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates, lower reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses related to COVID-19 projects, and our margin
enhancement initiatives.

Gross margins for our Clinical Solutions segment were 25.6% and 25.0% for the years ended December 31, 2022
and 2021, respectively. Gross margin was higher during 2022 as compared to the prior year primarily due to lower
reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses and positive impacts from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,
partially offset by increased billable headcount costs and contract labor.

_Commercial Solutions_

Direct costs for our Commercial Solutions segment, excluding share-based compensation expense, were as follows
(dollars in thousands):

**Change**
**2022** **2021** **2020** **2022 to 2021** **2021 to 2020**
Direct costs $ 1,078,745 $ 947,309 $ 847,330 $ 131,436 13.9% $ 99,979 11.8%
% of segment revenue 81.6% 79.3% 79.2%
Segment gross margin % 18.4% 20.7% 20.8%

For the year ended December 31, 2022, our Commercial Solutions segment direct costs increased by $ 131.4
million, or 13.9%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily driven by
increased billable headcount to support revenue growth and higher reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses.

Gross margins for our Commercial Solutions segment were 18.4% and 20.7% for the years ended December 31,
2022 and 2021, respectively. Gross margin was lower during 2022 as compared to the prior year primarily due to a
less favorable revenue mix, driven by new deployments of field teams and higher reimbursable out-of-pocket
expenses.


-----

**_Selling, General and Administrative Expenses_**

Selling, general and administrative expenses were as follows (dollars in thousands):

**Change**
**2022** **2021** **2020** **2022 to 2021** **2021 to 2020**
Selling, general and

administrative expenses $ 547,254 $ 570,765 $ 472,726 $ (23,511) (4.1)% $ 98,039 20.7%
% of total revenue 10.1% 10.9% 10.7%

Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased compared to the
prior year primarily due to lower transaction, integration-related, and other expenses and positive impacts from
our margin enhancement initiatives.

**_Restructuring and Other Costs_**

Restructuring and other costs were $ 56.6 million and $22.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and
2021, respectively. The costs incurred were primarily related to our margin enhancement initiatives and specific
actions focused on streamlining the operations of our Clinical Solutions segment to optimize efficiency and
enhance the delivery of customer projects.

Restructuring and other costs consisted of the following (in thousands):

**Year Ended December 31,**
**2022** **2021** **2020**
Employee severance and benefit costs $ 33,534 $ 14,526 $ 26,321
Facility and lease termination costs 19,107 8,226 2,313
Other costs 4,000 64 780
Total restructuring and other costs $ 56,641 $ 22,816 $ 29,414

We expect to continue to incur costs related to our business transformation initiatives, including the potential
outsourcing of certain administrative functions during 2023 and beyond as we continue the ongoing evaluations
of our global workforce and facilities infrastructure needs to improve customer engagement, increase innovation,
and achieve operating efficiencies.

**_Depreciation and Amortization Expense_**

Total depreciation and amortization expense was $247.2 million and $235.6 million for the years ended December
31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in total depreciation and amortization expense in 2022 compared to
2021 was primarily due to vehicle fleet leases and internal-use software.

**_Total Other Expense, Net_**

Total other expense, net consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):

**Change**
**2022** **2021** **2020** **2022 to 2021** **2021 to 2020**

(1349.5)

Interest income $ (1,609) $ (111) $ (265) $ (1,498) % $ 154 58.1%

Interest expense 82,397 79,252 91,145 3,145 4.0%  (11,893) (13.0)%
Loss on extinguishment of
debt 817 3,612 1,581 (2,795) (77.4)% 2,031 128.5%

(190.1)

Other expense (income), net 7,022 (8,633) (2,976) 15,655 n/m  (5,657) %

Total other expense, net $ 88,627 $ 74,120 $ 89,485 $ 14,507 19.6% $ (15,365) (17.2)%


-----

Total other expense, net was $88.6 million and $74.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively. The increase in total other expense, net was primarily due to higher other expense, net in 2022 as
compared to 2021, which primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses that result from exchange rate
fluctuations on our monetary asset balances denominated in currencies other than our functional currency. Other
expense (income), net also includes other gains and losses related to investments and contingent consideration
related to divested businesses. The increase in interest expense in 2022 as compared to 2021 was primarily due to
increased interest rates on variable rate debt. Due to higher variable interest rates, including the expiration of interest
rate swaps in March 2023, we expect to experience higher interest expense in 2023.

The loss on extinguishment of debt was $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $3.6
million for the year ended December 31, 2021. These losses were incurred primarily as a result of our debt
prepayments and refinancing transactions.

**_Income Tax Expense_**

For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded income tax expense of $48.1 million, on pre-tax income of
$314.6 million. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 varied from the U.S. federal
statutory income tax rate of 21.0% primarily due to R&D credits, foreign tax credits, and foreign income inclusions
such as the GILTI provisions.

For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded income tax expense of $80.3 million, on pre-tax income of
$315.2 million. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 varied from the U.S. federal
statutory income tax rate of 21.0% primarily due to foreign income inclusions such as the GILTI provisions, state
and local taxes on U.S. income, and research and general business credits.

We currently maintain valuation allowances against a portion of our state deferred tax assets and a portion of our
foreign deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2022. We intend to continue to maintain a valuation allowance on
these deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these
allowances.

**Pre-Transaction Liquidity and Capital Resources**

Key measures of our liquidity were as follows (in thousands):

**June 30,** **December 31,**
**2023** **2022** **2022** **2021** **2020**
**Balance sheet statistics:**

$

Cash and cash equivalents $ 82,167 $ 105,988 $ 111,893 $ 106,363 271,901

Restricted cash 109 108 111 112 272
Working capital (excluding restricted

cash) 324,493 174,304 219,134 112,228 160,409

As of June 30, 2023, we had $82.3 million of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. As of June 30, 2023,
substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash was held within the U.S. In addition, we had
$826.8 million (net of $14.2 million in undrawn letters of credit (“LOCs”)) available for borrowing under our
revolving credit facility (the “Existing Revolving Facility”), of which $135.8 million was available for LOCs.

We have historically funded our operations and growth, including acquisitions, primarily with our working capital,
cash flow from operations, and funds available through various borrowing arrangements. Our principal liquidity
requirements are to fund our debt service obligations, capital expenditures, expansion of service offerings, possible
acquisitions, integration and restructuring costs, geographic expansion, stock repurchases, working capital, and
other general corporate expenses. Cash flow from operations also could be affected by the broad effects of the
current macroeconomic environment on the global economy and major financial markets, including but not limited
to interest rate increases, inflation, and the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as various other risks and uncertainties


-----

detailed in “Risk Factors.” Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash
equivalents, cash generated from operations, and funds available under the Existing Revolving Facility will be
sufficient to meet our working capital needs, capital expenditures, scheduled debt and interest payments, income tax
obligations, and other currently anticipated liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months.

We may seek to raise additional capital, particularly in the event of a sustained market deterioration, which could be
in the form of bonds, convertible debt, or equity. If we obtain additional capital by issuing equity, the interests of
our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we incur additional indebtedness, that indebtedness may contain
significant financial and other covenants that may significantly restrict our operations. We cannot assure you that
we could obtain any refinancing or additional financing we may seek on favorable terms or at all.

**_Contractual Obligations_**

In addition to the indebtedness and related obligations assumed in business combinations, and uncertain tax
positions discussed elsewhere, we signed a $22.1 million non-cancellable purchase obligation for IT cloud services
related to the upgrading of our enterprise resource planning software during the fourth quarter of 2021, with equal
quarterly payments due over the next four years, which began in the third quarter of 2022. On January 31, 2023, we
signed an $80.0 million non-cancellable purchase obligation for IT cloud services over the next six years. There is
no upfront payment associated with this obligation and we will continue to be billed monthly for these services.

**_Indebtedness_**

As of June 30, 2023, we had approximately $2.71 billion of total principal indebtedness (including $55.5 million in
finance lease obligations), consisting of the $1.35 billion of term loans under the Existing Credit Agreement, $159.0
million under the Existing Revolving Facility, $600.0 million of Existing Notes, and $550.0 million in borrowings
against our Receivables Financing Agreement. See “Note 3 – Long-Term Debt Obligations” of our unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements included in this offering circular for additional details regarding our
long-term debt arrangements.

Our long-term debt arrangements contain customary restrictive covenants and, as of June 30, 2023, we were in
compliance with all applicable debt covenants.

_Interest Rates_

In March 2023, we entered into interest rate swaps with multiple counterparties. The interest rate swaps had an
initial aggregate notional value of $650.0 million, an effective date of March 31, 2023, and will expire on March
31, 2026. As of June 30, 2023, the notional value of these interest rate swaps was $650.0 million. Upon termination
of the interest rate swaps in conjunction with the consummation of the Merger, we expect that we will remit or
receive the difference between the fair value of the interest rate swaps and the replacement value in cash.

We have entered into these interest rate swaps to mitigate our exposure to changes in interest rates on our variable
rate debt. As of June 30, 2023, the percentage of our total principal debt (excluding finance leases) that is subject to
fixed interest rates was approximately 47%. Each quarter-point increase or decrease in the applicable floating
interest rate as of June 30, 2023 would change our annual interest expense by approximately $3.5 million.

**_Stock Repurchase Program_**

Our repurchase program authorizes us to repurchase up to an aggregate of $350.0 million of our Class A common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, through December 31, 2024 (the “2022 Stock Repurchase Program”). During the
six months ended June 30, 2023, there were no repurchases under the 2022 Stock Repurchase Program. As of June
30, 2023, we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to $350.0 million of shares of our Class A common
stock under the 2022 Stock Repurchase Program. See “Note 7 – Shareholders’ Equity” of our unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements included in this offering circular for additional details.

**_Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash_**

_Cash Flows for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 Versus the Six Months Ended June 30, 2022_

Our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities were as follows (in thousands):

### Six Months Ended June 30,
 2023 2022 Change Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities $ (3,258) $ 170,789 $ (174,047) (101.9)% Net cash used in investing activities (46,527) (51,063) 4,536 (8.9)% Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 26,148 (134,519) 160,667 (119.4)%

_Cash Flows from Operating Activities_

Cash flows from operating activities decreased by $174.0 million during the six months ended June 30, 2023
compared to the six months ended June 30, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to lower cash-related net income,
driven by higher direct costs, transaction, integration-related, and other expenses, and interest expense, and negative
changes in operating assets and liabilities relative to the prior year period. During the six months ended June 30,
2023, cash paid for interest was $61.6 million, an increase of $30.4 million as compared to the same period in the
prior year, primarily due to higher interest rates. Fluctuations in accounts receivable, unbilled services (including
contract assets), and deferred revenue occur on a regular basis as we perform services, achieve milestones or other
billing criteria, send invoices to customers, and collect outstanding accounts receivable. This activity varies by
individual customer and contract. We attempt to negotiate payment terms that provide for payment of services prior
to or soon after the provision of services, but the levels of accounts receivable, unbilled services (including contract
assets), and deferred revenue can vary significantly from period to period.

_Cash Flows from Investing Activities_

For the six months ended June 30, 2023, we used $46.5 million in cash for investing activities, which included
$45.5 million for purchases of property and equipment. We continue to closely monitor our capital expenditures
while making strategic investments in the development of our information technology infrastructure to meet the
needs of our workforce, enable efficiencies, reduce business continuity risks, and conform to changes in governing
rules and regulations.

For the six months ended June 30, 2022, we used $51.1 million in cash for investing activities, which included
$47.9 million for purchases of property and equipment.

_Cash Flows from Financing Activities_

For the six months ended June 30, 2023, cash flows provided by financing activities were $26.1 million, which
consisted primarily of net proceeds from our Existing Revolving Facility and our employee stock purchase plan,
partially offset by payments associated with tax withholdings for share-based compensation, contingent
consideration related to acquisitions, and finance leases.

For the six months ended June 30, 2022, we used $134.5 million in cash for financing activities, which consisted
primarily of repurchases of our common stock and payments related to tax withholdings for share-based
compensation. These payments were partially offset by net proceeds from our Existing Revolving Facility.

_Cash Flows from Operating Activities_

Cash flows provided by operating activities decreased by $23.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 as
compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to lower cash-related net income, partially offset by
positive changes in operating assets and liabilities relative to the prior year period. Fluctuations in accounts
receivable, unbilled services (including contract assets), and deferred revenue occur on a regular basis as we perform
services, achieve milestones or other billing criteria, send invoices to customers, and collect outstanding accounts
receivable. This activity varies by individual customer and contract. We attempt to negotiate payment terms that
provide for payment of services prior to or soon after the provision of services, but the levels of accounts receivable,
unbilled services (including contract assets), and deferred revenue can vary significantly from period to period.

_Cash Flows from Investing Activities_

For the year ended December 31, 2022, we used $105.6 million in cash for investing activities, which included
$93.5 million for purchases of property and equipment. We continue to closely monitor our capital expenditures
while making strategic investments in the development of our IT infrastructure to meet the needs of our workforce,
enable efficiencies, reduce business continuity risks, and conform to changes in governing rules and regulations.

For the year ended December 31, 2021, we used $340.3 million in cash for investing activities, which consisted of
$278.9 million of payments related to recent acquisitions and $56.8 million for purchases of property and
equipment.

_Cash Flows from Financing Activities_

For the year ended December 31, 2022, we used $339.2 million in cash for financing activities, which consisted
primarily of net payments of long-term debt, repurchases of common stock, and payments related to tax
withholdings for share-based compensation. These payments were partially offset by proceeds from our accounts
receivable financing arrangement and Existing Revolving Facility.

For the year ended December 31, 2021, we used $277.6 million in cash for financing activities, which consisted
primarily of net repayments of long-term debt and repurchases of our common stock. These payments were partially
offset by proceeds from our accounts receivable financing arrangement.

**Post-Transaction Liquidity and Capital Resources**

Following the consummation of the Transactions, our liquidity requirements will be changed, primarily due to the
additional debt service requirements to our existing cash needs discussed above. Our principal sources of liquidity
after the Transactions will be cash generated by our operating cash flows, as well as funds available under the New
Credit Facilities. Our principal uses of cash after the consummation of the Transactions will be to meet debt service
requirements and to fund working capital and capital expenditures. On a pro forma basis after giving effect to the
Transactions, our total cash interest expense for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 would have been
approximately $349.0 million.


-----

As of June 30, 2023, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, key measures of our liquidity
would be as follows (in thousands):

**Balance sheet statistics:**
Cash and cash equivalents $ 298,727
Restricted cash 109
Working capital (excluding restricted cash) 445,234

In addition, we would have had $485.8 million (net of $14.2 million in undrawn letters of credit) available for
borrowing under our New Revolving Facility, of which up to $150 million would be available for letters of credit.
The aggregate amount of undrawn letters of credit is expected to increase soon after the Effective Time. See “Risk
Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Downgrades of our credit ratings could adversely affect us.” We believe
that our current cash and cash equivalents, along with cash that will be provided by future operations, and borrowing
expected to be available under the New Credit Facilities, will be sufficient to fund our operations, capital
expenditures, and debt service requirements over at least the next twelve months.

**_Notes and New Credit Facilities_**

In connection with the Merger, we intend to issue $1,700 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes offered
hereby and to enter into the New Credit Agreement, which provides for (i) the New Term Facility, a senior secured
first lien term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount equal to $2,000 million, and (ii) the New Revolving
Facility, a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount equal to $500 million.

From and after the consummation of the Merger and following the release of the Escrowed Property (if applicable),
the Notes and related guarantees will be secured by first-priority liens, subject to certain permitted liens, on the
Collateral (as defined herein), which consists of substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and guarantors, which
assets will also secure the Issuer’s and the guarantors’ obligations under the New Credit Facilities. From and after
the consummation of the Merger and following the release of the Escrowed Property (if applicable), the Notes and
the related guarantees will be the Issuer’s and the guarantors’ senior secured obligations and will be: (i) secured on a
first-priority basis by the Collateral on a pari passu basis with the New Credit Facilities and all future indebtedness
of the Issuer and guarantors secured by a first-priority lien on the Collateral; (ii) pari passu in right of payment with
all of the Issuer’s and the guarantors’ existing and future senior indebtedness; (iii) effectively senior to all the
Issuer’s and the guarantors’ existing and future indebtedness that is unsecured or that is secured by junior liens on
the Collateral, to the extent of the value of the Collateral; (iv) senior in right of payment to any of the Issuer’s and
the guarantors’ future subordinated indebtedness; (v) effectively subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness
of the Issuer or any guarantor that is secured by assets that are not Collateral; and (vi) structurally subordinated to
any existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of any subsidiary that does not guarantee the Notes,
including our foreign subsidiaries. The New Credit Agreement and the indenture that will govern the Notes each
will contain operating covenants and restrictions that limit our operations and could lead to adverse consequences if
we fail to comply with them. These restrictions will limit the Issuer’s ability and the ability of our restricted
subsidiaries to, among other things: incur or guarantee additional debt or issue disqualified stock or preferred stock;
pay dividends and make other distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock; make certain investments,
loans and advances; incur certain liens; enter into certain transactions with affiliates; merge or consolidate; enter into
agreements that restrict the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make dividends or other payments to the Issuer or the
guarantors; designate restricted subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and transfer or sell assets. See “Description
of Notes” for a description of the Notes and “Description of Certain Other Indebtedness” for a description of the
New Credit Facilities.

As part of the Transactions, we intend to consummate the Debt Refinancing, comprising of the repayment in full
(and the release of guarantees by and security interests in the assets of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries
thereunder) of the outstanding borrowings under the Existing Credit Agreement and the Existing Revolving Facility
under the Existing Credit Agreement; (ii) redemption in full of the Existing Notes and (iii) repayment in full (and the
release of security interests in the assets of the borrower thereunder) of the outstanding amounts under the
Receivables Financing Agreement.


-----

As of June 30, 2023, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, including the Debt Refinancing, we
would have had approximately $3,700 million of total indebtedness, all of which would have been first priority
senior secured indebtedness. In addition, we would have had $485.8 million available for borrowing under the New
Revolving Facility (after taking into account $14.2 million of undrawn letters of credit), subject to customary
conditions. Any borrowings under the New Revolving Facility, once made, would constitute first priority senior
secured indebtedness.

**_Sponsor Equity Investment_**

In connection with the Merger, the Sponsors, or their respective controlled affiliates or controlled investment funds,
will make an aggregate equity contribution to the Issuer of approximately $3,990 million.

**Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates**

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make
estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses
during the period, as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. We
evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to revenue recognition, valuation of goodwill and
identifiable intangibles, and tax-related contingencies and valuation allowances. These estimates are based on the
information available to management at the time these estimates, judgments, and assumptions are made. Actual
results may differ materially from these estimates.

**_Acquisitions_**

We account for acquisitions in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, using the acquisition
method of accounting. The purchase price, or total consideration transferred, is determined as the fair value of assets
exchanged, equity instruments issued, and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. The acquisition method of
accounting requires that the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in
the acquiree are measured and recorded at their fair values on the date of an acquisition. Goodwill represents the
excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired, including the amount assigned
to identifiable intangible assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. The consolidated financial
statements reflect the results of operations of the acquiree from the date of the acquisition. For additional
information, see Note 3 – Acquisitions, Divestitures, and Investments” to our unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements included in the this offering circular.

**_Revenue Recognition_**

We adopted ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers and all the related amendments (“new
revenue standard” or “ASC 606”) on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method for all contracts not
completed as of the date of adoption. In accordance with ASC 606, revenue is recognized when, or as, a customer
obtains control of promised services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which we
expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for these services.

The majority of our Clinical Solutions segment revenue is for service offerings that range in duration from a few
months to several years and typically represent a single performance obligation. Revenue for these service contracts
is recognized over time using an input measure of progress. The input measure reflects costs (including investigator
payments and pass-through costs) incurred to date relative to total estimated costs to complete the contract (“cost-tocost measure of progress”). Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress methodology, revenue is recorded
proportionally to costs incurred. Contract costs principally include direct labor, investigator payments, and passthrough costs. The estimate of total revenue and costs to completion requires significant judgment. Contract
estimates are based on various assumptions to project future outcomes of events that often span several years, as
well as on evaluations and updates made on an ongoing basis. These estimates are reviewed periodically and any
adjustments are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period they become known. Updates and
adjustments to estimates are likely to result in variability in revenue recognized from period to period and may cause
unexpected variability in our operating results. In addition, in certain instances a customer contract may include
forms of variable consideration such as incentive fees, volume rebates or other provisions that can increase or


-----

decrease the transaction price. This variable consideration is generally awarded upon achievement of certain
performance metrics, program milestones or cost targets. For the purposes of revenue recognition, variable
consideration is assessed on a contract-by-contract basis and the amount to be recorded is estimated based on the
assessment of our anticipated performance and consideration of all information that is reasonably available. Variable
consideration is recognized as revenue if and when it is deemed probable that a significant reversal in the amount of
cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is
resolved in the future.

The largest of the service offerings within the Commercial Solutions segment relates to Deployment Solutions.
Deployment Solutions contracts consist of services to promote and sell commercial products on behalf of a
customer. The remaining Commercial Solutions contracts are generally short-term, month-to-month contracts or
time and materials contracts. As such, Commercial Solutions revenue is generally recognized as services are
performed for the amount we estimate we are entitled to for the period. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis,
revenue is recognized over time based on the proportion of labor costs expended to total labor costs expected to
complete the contract.

Most of our contracts can be terminated by the customer without cause with a notice period that generally ranges
from 30 to 90 days. In the event of termination, our contracts generally provide that the customer pay us for: (i) fees
earned through the termination date; (ii) fees and expenses for winding down the project, which include both fees
incurred and actual expenses; (iii) non-cancellable expenditures; and (iv) in some cases, a fee to cover a portion of
the remaining professional fees on the project. Our long-term clinical trial contracts contain implied substantive
termination penalties because of the significant wind-down cost of terminating a clinical trial. These provisions for
termination penalties result in these types of contracts being treated as long-term for revenue recognition purposes.

Changes in the scope of work are common, especially under long-term contracts, and generally result in a
renegotiation of future contract pricing terms and change in contract transaction price. If the customer does not agree
to a contract modification, we could bear the risk of cost overruns. Most of our contract modifications are for
services that are not distinct from the services under the existing contract due to the significant integration service
provided in the context of the contract and therefore result in a cumulative catch-up adjustment to revenue at the
date of contract modification.

_Timing of Billing and Performance_

Differences in the timing of revenue recognition and associated billings and cash collections result in recording of
billed accounts receivable, unbilled accounts receivable, contract assets, and deferred revenue on the consolidated
balance sheet. Amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms either at
periodic intervals or upon achievement of contractual milestones. Billings generally occur subsequent to revenue
recognition, resulting in recording of unbilled accounts receivable in instances where the right to bill is contingent
solely on the passage of time (e.g., in the following month) and contract assets in instances where the right to bill is
associated with a contingency (e.g., achievement of a milestone).

Accounts receivable are recorded at net realizable value. Unbilled accounts receivable (including contract assets)
arise when services have been rendered for which revenue has been recognized but the customers have not been
billed. In general, prerequisites for billings and payments are established by contractual provisions, including
predetermined payment schedules, which may or may not correspond to the timing of the performance of services
under the contract. Contract assets include unbilled amounts typically resulting from revenue recognized in excess
of the amounts billed to the customer for which the right to payment is subject to factors other than the passage of
time. These amounts may not exceed their net realizable value. Contract assets are generally classified as current.
Deferred revenue represents contract liabilities and consists of customer payments received in advance of
performance and billings in excess of revenue recognized, net of revenue recognized from the balance at the
beginning of the period. Contract assets and deferred revenue are presented on the balance sheet on a net contractby-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.

**_Goodwill and Intangible Assets_**


-----

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and
more frequently if impairment indicators arise, which requires significant judgment. Impairment indicators include
events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit with
assigned goodwill below its carrying amount. We monitor events and changes in circumstances on a continuous
basis between annual impairment testing dates to determine if any events or changes in circumstances indicate
impairment. Separate intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives or
over the period in which economic benefit is received. Our finite-lived intangibles consist of customer relationships,
acquired backlog, trade names, trademarks, patient communities, and acquired technologies. All finite-lived
intangibles, excluding acquired backlog, are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the
asset. Acquired backlog is amortized on an accelerated basis, which coincides with the period of economic benefit
received by us.

The goodwill impairment test involves comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit, including
goodwill, to its carrying value using a qualitative or quantitative analysis. If the qualitative analysis indicates that it
is more likely than not that the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value for the reporting unit, we perform
a quantitative analysis of the reporting unit. If based on the qualitative analysis it is more likely than not that the
reporting unit’s estimated fair value exceeds its carrying value, no further analysis is required. If after performing
the quantitative analysis it is more likely than not that the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair
value, a non-cash goodwill impairment loss must be recognized in an amount equal to that excess for that reporting
unit, not to exceed the total goodwill amount for that reporting unit.

The fair value of a reporting unit could be negatively impacted by future events and circumstances. Such events or
circumstances include a future decline in our results of operations, a decline in the valuation of biopharmaceutical
company stocks, an increase in weighted-average cost of capital, a significant slowdown in the worldwide economy,
failure to meet the performance projections included in our forecasts of future operating results, loss of key
customers, and a reduction in R&D spending or outsourcing by biopharmaceutical companies, among other events
and circumstances.

When performing the quantitative analysis, we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using the income
approach. This approach incorporates a discounted cash flow model in which the estimated future cash flows of the
reporting unit are discounted using a risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital. The forecasts used in the
discounted cash flow model for each reporting unit are based in part on strategic plans and represent our estimates
based on current and forecasted business and market conditions. The determination of fair value for each reporting
unit requires significant judgments and estimates and actual results could be materially different than those
judgments and estimates, which may result in a non-cash impairment charge. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we
performed a quantitative analysis for our Communications reporting unit, which had a goodwill balance of $529.1
million as of December 31, 2022. We concluded that the estimated fair value of our Communications reporting unit
exceeded its carrying value by approximately $19.0 million, or 3%, and therefore no impairment existed.

Although we believe that the current assumptions and estimates used in our goodwill analysis are reasonable,
supportable, and appropriate, continued efforts to maintain or improve the performance of our businesses, including
our Communications reporting unit, could be impacted by unfavorable or unforeseen changes that could impact the
existing assumptions used in the impairment analysis. Various factors could reasonably be expected to unfavorably
impact existing assumptions: primarily delays in awards and the related delay in revenue, increases in termination
activity, continued deterioration of macroeconomic conditions, and increases in operating costs or weighted-average
cost of capital. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for the purposes of
the goodwill impairment analysis will prove to be accurate predictions of future performance.

**_Income Taxes_**

The majority of our U.S. subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return, while certain U.S.
subsidiaries, including recently acquired entities, may file separate U.S. federal tax returns. Our subsidiaries in
international jurisdictions file tax returns in their respective jurisdictions.

We provide for income taxes on all transactions that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements.
Specifically, we estimate our tax liability based on current tax laws in the statutory jurisdictions in which we


-----

operate. Accordingly, the impact of changes in income tax laws on deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are
recognized in net earnings in the period during which such changes are enacted.

We record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax
bases of assets and liabilities and for tax benefit carryforwards using enacted tax rates in effect in the year in which
the differences are expected to reverse.

We provide valuation allowances against deferred tax assets for amounts that are not considered more likely than not
to be realized. The valuation of the deferred tax asset is dependent on, among other things, our ability to generate a
sufficient level of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we have considered both positive and
negative evidence, such as historical and forecasted results of operations, and have considered the implementation of
prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. If the objectively verifiable negative evidence outweighs any available
positive evidence (or the only available positive is subjective and cannot be verified), then a valuation allowance
will likely be deemed necessary. If a valuation allowance is deemed to be unnecessary, such allowance is released
and any related benefit is recognized in the period of the change.

We recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if we believe it is more likely than not to be sustained
upon examination based on the technical merits of the position. Judgment is required in determining what constitutes
an individual tax position, as well as the assessment of the outcome of each tax position. We consider many factors
when evaluating and estimating tax positions and tax benefits. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves
dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in domestic and foreign jurisdictions. We
evaluate uncertain tax positions pursuant to the more likely than not standard, and benefits related to such uncertain
tax positions are recognized as the largest amount of benefit, determined on a cumulative probability basis, to be
realized upon ultimate settlement of the position. If the calculation of the liability related to uncertain tax positions
proves to be more or less than the ultimate settlement, a tax expense or benefit, respectively, would result.
Unrecognized tax benefits are presented as either a reduction to a deferred tax asset or as a separate liability.

**_Recently Issued Accounting Standards_**

For a description of recently issued accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and the
estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated financial statements, see “Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this offering
circular.

**Our Solutions**

We provide services through two reportable segments: Clinical Solutions (CRO) and Commercial Solutions (CCO).
Our Clinical Solutions segment offers comprehensive global services for the development of diagnostics, drugs,
biologics, devices, and digital therapeutics that span Phases I to IV of clinical development. This segment also offers
customized individual services including regulatory consulting, project management, protocol development,
investigational site recruitment, clinical monitoring, technology-enabled patient recruitment and engagement,
clinical home health services, clinical trial diversity and biometrics, all across a wide range of TAs. Our Commercial
Solutions segment offers solutions including field team deployment and communications and full-service integrated
offerings to the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and healthcare industries. Together, our services cover the entire
spectrum of clinical development and marketing and related support, from early-stage clinical development through
FDA approval and ultimately commercialization. We believe this collaboration across the development and
commercialization continuum facilitates unique insights impacting patient populations, therapeutic environments,
product launch timelines, and the competitive landscape.

**_Clinical Solutions_** _(76% of 2022 Revenue)_

Our extensive range of clinical solutions supports the entire clinical development process from Phase I to Phase IV.
We have strengths in complex TAs such as CNS, cell and gene therapy, infectious disease and vaccines,
immunology, inflammation and oncology, with the latter representing the largest and fastest growing TA. Our
solutions can be delivered on a full-service project basis, on a functional service basis, or through a hybrid approach
depending on the needs of our customers. Our Clinical Solutions segment had average annual net revenue growth of
8% from 2019 to 2022.

Our suite of clinical development services includes the following, among others:

FSO. Our Full-Service clinical development offering (73% of Clinical Solutions 2022 Net Revenue) provides
comprehensive solutions to address the clinical development needs of our customers, focused on Phase IIB to Phase
III clinical trials. FSO clinical study services are highly technical in nature, with multi-year average contract lengths
and high switching costs for customers mid-study. Our full suite of clinical development services includes the


-----

following, among others: patient recruitment and retention, site start-up services, project management, clinical
monitoring, decentralized solutions (e.g., remote engagement and mobile research nursing clinical trial services), drug
safety and pharmacovigilance, quality assurance, regulatory and medical writing, clinical data management, electronic
data capture, and biostatistics.

FSP. Our Functional Service Provider offering (19% of Clinical Solutions 2022 Net Revenue) allows
pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical sponsors to outsource specific functional areas of clinical research and/or
selectively augment their internal resources. As part of the FSP delivery method, we provide highly skilled and
technical personnel to build “centers of excellence” within the customer’s organization that provide functional
support for executing clinical trials. Through the FSP model, we can provide customized support to customers
within an individual clinical study, a single function, multiple functions within a single TA, or across a customer’s
entire product portfolio. This business is highly recurring in nature, because our personnel are deeply embedded in
customers’ clinical trial organizations. This integration typically results in the customers staying with the same FSP
service provider for multiple years, with underlying FSP MSAs typically lasting approximately three years.
Historically, our growing FSP business has also helped us win incremental FSO business over time, particularly
with the large pharmaceutical customers that represent a significant portion of the FSP market.

Early Phase & Other Solutions. Our Early Phase & Other Solutions offerings (8% of Clinical Solutions 2022 Net
Revenue) consist of our Early Phase offering, our RWE & Late Phase offering, and our Clinical Technology & Data
businesses.

Our Early Phase offering provides a full range of services for early phase to Phase IIA clinical trials, including
bioanalytical assay development and analysis, targeted translational science offerings, and clinical pharmacology
services, including modeling and simulation. We also provide validation and sample analysis services from preclinical development through post-marketing support and purpose-built early phase biometrics support. We have
robust expertise with an array of investigational products, including those of biological origin and with multiple
delivery methods. We collaborate with leading hospitals for the conduct of early development and clinical
pharmacology studies that require access to patients. We have a large base of available subjects, including patient
populations with specific medical conditions and healthy volunteers, which provides efficient and rapid patient
recruitment. Our Early Phase services require sites and staff that are specifically set up and trained for early stage
trials.

Our Other Solutions include our RWE and Late Phase businesses that provide outsourced, long-term longitudinal
studies focused on tracking the health impact of medicines in patient populations. Our Technology & Data business,
which launched and ramped up in 2021, includes predictive analytics and AI-based applications that facilitate
pharmaceutical customers’ trial processes (e.g. country and site selection, patient recruitment and enrollment, and site
activation).

The TAs that we cover include CNS, oncology, general medicine, cardiovascular and metabolic, and respiratory,
among others. CNS and oncology made up approximately 50% of Clinical Solutions net revenue in 2022. Within

**Our Business Strategy**

Our goal is to be the partner of choice to the pharmaceutical industry by translating our unique clinical and commercial
insights into superior customer outcomes. We believe our ability to strategically integrate clinical development,
medical affairs, and commercial capabilities is unique, allowing for clinical insights to inform commercialization and
for commercial insights to improve clinical trial design and execution. The key elements of our business strategy
include:

**_Bringing differentiated solutions to the market that accelerate customer outcomes. We believe we are uniquely_**
positioned to address our customers’ evolving needs as a leading fully integrated pharmaceutical solutions
organization. We translate unique clinical, medical affairs and commercial insights into outcomes to address modern
market realities. Our breadth of services enables us to provide customized solutions designed to successfully accelerate
the time to market for our customers’ clinical and commercial projects. We believe sharing commercial insights during
the early phases of clinical trials can lead to better informed decisions around clinical trial design and strategies.
Similarly, we believe our therapeutic and clinical trial expertise can lead to improved decisions about regulatory and
payer approvals, market access, reimbursement and formulary inclusion, field team development, and other steps that
are critical to the commercial success of our customers.

**_Further penetrating the large pharmaceutical market. We believe one of the largest opportunities to increase our_**
market share and improve our market position is to further penetrate large pharmaceutical companies. Large
pharmaceutical companies have increasingly focused on partnering with larger outsourcing vendors that offer a full
suite of service capabilities. We have made great progress in increasing wallet share amongst large pharmaceutical
customers by both winning new FSP business as well as entering new FSO preferred partnerships. We expect to
continue to grow market share in this segment, and have invested in expanding our global scale, breadth of services,
and infrastructure to build up our service capabilities for this customer sector.

**_Continuing our expansion in the SMID market. We believe there is opportunity to grow in the SMID market_**
segment. SMID is a growing market and we are particularly well-positioned given our legacy of being a trusted clinical
and commercialization partner to SMID customers. Our 2020 acquisition of Synteract further enhanced our position
for serving SMID and biotech customers, diversifying our customer base and expanding support to emerging
pharmaceutical companies. We aim to leverage our full suite of clinical and commercialization services, our Syneos
One® solutions, and our therapeutic expertise and organizational alignment down to the CRA level, as well as our
Trusted Process® operating model to further penetrate the SMID market.

**_Capitalizing on industry trends favoring outsourcing. We believe our Clinical Solutions and Commercial Solutions_**
segments can benefit from growth in pharmaceutical spending coupled with increasing penetration of outsourcing to
deliver attractive growth rates over the long term. Higher costs and increasing complexity of clinical trials are driving
our customers to seek efficiency and expertise through outsourcing services. We believe outsourcing both clinical
development and commercialization services optimizes returns on invested R&D for pharmaceutical companies.

**_Strengthening our geographic footprint._** We have developed a global platform with a presence in the major
pharmaceutical markets and intend to further expand our business outside of the United States, targeting regions where
we are underpenetrated and that offer significant growth opportunities. We have added geographic reach through both
acquisitions and organic growth in Asia-Pacific, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, and Europe. We believe


-----

these regions are critical to obtaining business awards from large and mid-sized pharmaceutical companies as trials
become increasingly complex and global. Through our business transformation initiatives, we plan to progress to a
more country-based business delivery model.

**_Accelerate enterprise growth through our Syneos One® offering. Syneos One provides an integrated cross-_**
functional team to provide multiple solutions to the client, including full service clinical development, medical strategy
and risk management and commercialization capabilities. We believe our Syneos One® solutions are uniquely
positioned to determine the appropriate mix of clinical and commercial services to help customers optimize the
development process of their assets and maximize the return on their investment.

**_Transforming our organization to improve customer engagement, increase innovation, and achieve operating_**
**_efficiencies. We are pursuing transformation initiatives that are designed to enhance customer engagement and_**
revitalize innovation and insights throughout our operations. We are focused on innovation that integrates artificial
intelligence and predictive analytics to drive faster data insights and patient outcomes. Leveraging tools and
automation will help us simplify processes and improve real-time visibility, optimize our operational footprint, and
streamline the organization and outsourcing where we believe appropriate. We also seek to improve our productivity,
flexibility, quality, functionality, and cost savings by investing in the development and implementation of global
platforms and integration of our business processes and functions to achieve economies of scale.

**Key Strengths**

**_Large, Growing and Resilient CRO and CCO Markets. We cater to large, addressable markets, with the contract_**
research organization (“CRO”) market estimated at approximately $40 billion and the contract commercialization
organization (“CCO”) market at approximately $30 billion. Moreover, both these markets have recorded consistent
historical growth, with high-single-digit compound annual growth rates (“CAGRs”) in customer spend over the past
10+ years. The CRO market in particular has demonstrated historical resiliency across market cycles, growing each
year during the period from 2005 through 2022. These markets are expected to continue to steadily grow at mid-tohigh single digit CAGRs through 2027, driven by growth in biopharma research and development and sales and
marketing spend and coupled with continued outsourcing penetration, which are in turn driven by underlying demand
for pharmaceuticals, increasingly complex clinical trials, and expanding regulatory requirements.

**_Provider of Mission-Critical Solutions to Biopharma Industry. Through our expertise and service offerings we assist_**
pharmaceutical and biotech companies in the development and ultimate commercialization of the products that are
core to their long-term growth. The cost of drug development is high and continues to grow due to the increasing
complexity and duration of trials, and pharmaceutical companies are generally willing to pay a premium to CROs that
can provide speed and certainty of execution given the mission-critical nature of the clinical development services
provided and the high cost of failure for customers.

**_Scaled Service Offering Enabling us to Address Evolving Customer Demands. As one of the largest global CROs,_**
our large employee base, expertise in running large clinical trials and broad geographic footprint position us for growth
in an industry where scale matters. For pharmaceutical and biotech customers, scale, headcount and ability to run
complex and global clinical trials are key purchasing criteria when selecting service providers. The increasing
complexity and global nature of clinical trials have enabled large global CROs to continue to gain share relative to
mid-sized players. As the fourth largest CRO and one of only six CROs with the capabilities, scale and experience to
perform large clinical trials we believe we are well positioned to continue to grow in the global CRO market.

**_Multi-Year Agreements with Customers Provide High Degree of Revenue Visibility. Due to the nature of the services_**
we provide we typically enter into multi-year contracts with our customers that provide us with a high degree of
revenue visibility. Given the critical nature of the services that we provide and the long-term nature of clinical
development trials our FSO customers typically face high switching costs once they’ve entered into a contract.
Through our FSP model we provide customized support to customers where our personnel are deeply embedded in
customer’s clinical trial organizations, with master service agreements that typically have approximately three years
duration. The long-term nature of our service offerings results in an existing backlog that provides a high degree of
revenue visibility for the CRO business.

**_Deep Expertise and Differentiated Value Proposition Across Therapeutic Areas and Delivery Models._** We are
differentiated by our significant experience, deep therapeutic knowledge, and ability to manage complex trials,


-----

including in oncology and CNS, which are two of the largest and fastest growing therapeutic areas. Oncology is
Syneos’ largest therapeutic area at 33% of clinical net revenue and is the highest growth therapeutic area for CRO
spend, while CNS is one the fastest growing therapeutic areas due to increased investment from pharmaceutical R&D
spend and biotech funding in the space. Oncology FSO net revenue has grown at a CAGR of approximately 24% from
2019 to 2022, while the overall market grew 10% during this same time period, with recent RFPs and awards
suggesting that CNS is well-positioned to grow. Our net promotor scores (“NPS”) for both Oncology and CNS are
ahead of or in-line with leading players.

We also have a leading position in FSP and were an early entrant in the market. Our portfolio of services is integrated
with many customers’ drug development processes. This allows us to be well positioned to provide customized FSP
solutions to meet customers’ demands. Moreover, FSP delivery as a portion of the outsourcing market is growing,
driven primarily by large pharmaceutical customers who want to maintain oversight and influence over their drug
development pipeline while outsourcing key mission-critical services to CROs. From 2018 to 2021, FSP penetration
of total outsourced clinical trial activities increased from 28% to 41%, representing approximately 13% growth per
year. Over the past three years our FSP business has grown from $344 million of net revenue in 2019 to $522 million
in 2022, representing a 15% CAGR from 2019 to 2022.

**_Clearly Identified and Achievable Cost Savings. Our recent and ongoing investment in operations and organizational_**
realignment is expected to lead to meaningful margin expansion over time, as we increase productivity of key
resources, simplify project teams and management structure and improve processes. We also have other opportunities
for incremental cost savings, including increasing offshoring of non-customer facing clinical operations and back
office resources, potentially implementing a single ERP platform, and other systems and process initiatives. The chart
below shows the Clinical Solutions segment adjusted EBITDA margin (net of unallocated corporate costs, which are
allocated based on segment revenue contribution) relative to our peers as of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.
This gap illustrates the margin opportunity, which we are actively working to achieve.

**_Performance Turnaround Driven by Initiatives that Support Continued Growth. We have made significant progress_**
in undertaking a number of high-impact initiatives that have already resulted in improved business performance and
are expected to lead to continued growth. Following an approximate 40% growth in bookings from 2019 to 2022 as a
result of our leadership in growing segments of the market, our Clinical Solutions business experienced a decline in
performance in the second half of 2022 driven by industry-high turnover and a lack of sufficient investment in our
administrative systems after years of rapid growth. We have since made significant progress to address the
performance challenges the company experienced in 2022.

Across the industry, employee attrition increased through 2020 and 2021 due to a combination of the “Great
Resignation” (the ongoing economic trend where employees voluntarily resigned from their jobs in mass in early
2021, sparked by the COVID pandemic) and cross-competitor recruiting of talent. Syneos experienced above-market
attrition, driven by high utilization, underinvested administrative systems and operational volatility, with an
approximate 95% increase in trailing 6-month voluntary attrition from June 2020 to September 2021. Over the last
18 months we have worked to improve employee engagement and reduce turnover by increasing wages to be in-line
with or above market, centralizing resource management, and focusing on employee satisfaction. As a result, employee
attrition has consistently trended down and has normalized to pre-2020 levels.

To improve our underinvested administrative systems we initiated targeted upgrades of critical operational and backoffice systems, which are already improving workflow, and also took steps to improve customer-facing technology.
This has resulted in recent quarterly results showing indications of significant progress, two indicators of which are
FSA to target and LPI to target. FSA are new projects where we had the first trial active prior to the target start date,
and LPI are projects where we met the target date for completion of the last patient in the trial. Both metrics represent
our ability to deliver on customers’ required timelines and are an important purchasing factor for pharmaceutical
companies when choosing a CRO. In the quarter ended June 30, 2023, our FSA and LPI to target metrics hit their
highest levels since 2021, with FSA to target improving by approximately 45% from its trough in the first half of 2022
and LPI to target improving by approximately 50% since the second half of 2021 which, amongst other key
performance indicators, is an indication of the improvements made in our delivery model.

We have also streamlined operations by reducing business unit siloing, encouraging cross-team collaboration, and
dedicating significant resources to address customer delivery challenges. These actions have also resulted in a projectcentric delivery model focused on operational discipline, appropriate staffing, and trial performance, and have resulted
in improved performance scorecards and new awards.

As a result of our recent operational initiatives, we have seen a consistent improvement in RFP flow and book-to-bill
after a trough in the quarter ended September 30, 2022. Clinical Solutions RFP flow was up approximately 26% in
the quarter ended June 30, 2023 compared to the trough in the quarter ended September 30, 2022. This increase was
driven by strong performance across both Top 50 and SMID customers. Clinical Solutions book-to-bill has also
increased significantly compared to the trough in the quarter ended September 30, 2022, growing for three consecutive
quarters and reaching 0.9x in the quarter ended June 30, 2023. Both RFP flow and awards represent leading indicators
for future revenue growth.

**_Proven Leadership Team Well-Positioned to Drive Value. Our dynamic leadership team brings a diverse skillset to_**
the table alongside decades of industry experience across pharmaceutical outsourcing. The Sponsors have long-term
familiarity with Syneos, and through their prior investments have built deep knowledge of the pharmaceutical sector
and the CRO space specifically. Additionally, the Sponsors have a proven track record for growing scaled healthcare
and services businesses and driving operational improvement in such businesses through a codified, well-proven
“playbook.” Following the close of the Transactions, Colin Shannon, former CEO of PRA plans to join Syneos as
Executive Chairman. PRA was a global CRO that was taken public in 2014 and acquired by ICON, another global
CRO, in 2021 for $12 billion in consideration. Under Shannon’s leadership, PRA expanded EBITDA margins while
consistently achieving above-market revenue growth. During Shannon’s tenure, PRA grew its enterprise value from
approximately $2 billion at the time of its initial public offering in 2014 to its sale price of approximately $12 billion
in 2021. We also recently hired Mike Bonello, former Chief Financial Officer of PRA, as our Chief Financial Officer.

**Our Industry**

We operate within the CRO and CCO markets, which, as of December 31, 2022 combined represented an
approximately $70 billion addressable market that is expected to grow at approximately 7% per year through 2027.

CROs help pharmaceutical and biotech companies design and execute clinical trials. In addition to recruiting
investigational sites and ultimately patients and managing clinical trial sites, CROs provide a variety of services to
ensure that trial runs efficiently. They provide project and data management, research and regulatory compliance
services, research education, and medical writing, in addition to other services. CROs play a pivotal role in the
pharmaceutical and drug development process, improving speed and certainty of trial outcomes while providing
critical services that assist in the navigation of complex regulatory environments.

CCOs offer a wide array of commercialization services to their customers, typically related to preparing new products
for launch and maximizing sales. Typically, CCOs operate across medical affairs, marketing, market access, and other
commercialization services. Medical affairs teams focus on target customer analysis to find key stakeholders who they
can leverage to make a successful brand. Market access is the practice of making the drug available to patients,
covering the full range from pricing strategy to reimbursement. Other commercialization services typically focus on
back-end regulatory, technical, and operational services.

**_Expected growth of clinical drug development market. Pharmaceutical companies continue to prioritize the_**
outsourcing of clinical trials to CROs like us. Based on industry sources and management estimates, we believe that
the CRO market includes approximately $40 billion of Phase I-IV trial outsourcing spend that is directly addressable
by Syneos’ services; this market is forecasted to grow approximately 7% per year through 2027, driven by increases
in trial volume, complexity, and duration, increases in pricing, R&D budget increases and further outsourcing
penetration.


**CRO Market Over Time ($bn)**


2018 2022 2027E

Global CRO Market Size

CROs have become larger and vastly more diversified across functions and TAs, expanding their addressable market
and backlogs. We expect scaled and global CROs will continue to gain market share, as customers look to expand
their capabilities in fast-growing TAs and run increasingly global trials. Moreover, customers are bolstering their


-----

suite of services beyond traditional clinical capabilities, including post-approval, commercial, informatics, among
other ancillary offerings where outsourced penetration is low, driving greater outsourcing demand.

Key drivers of growth in the CRO industry include growing trial volume driven by increasing pharmaceutical research
and development investment, increasing duration and complexity of clinical trials, increases in pricing, and to a lesser
extent increasing demand for outsourcing.

**_Pharmaceutical R&D Spend Growth. Pharmaceutical R&D spend has grown faster than sales over the last decade_**
and Phase I-IV trial outsourcing spend that is directly addressable by our services is forecasted to grow approximately
7% through 2027. R&D spend from large pharmaceutical companies is expected to be driven by patent cliffs in the
late 2020s, which will necessitate drug discovery R&D. Furthermore, while there is near-term softness expected in
the biotech segment due to a normalization of venture capital funding from 2019-2021 highs, this segment is also
expected to return to growth going forward.

**_Management of increasingly lengthy and complex clinical trials. The pharmaceutical industry operates in an_**
increasingly sophisticated and highly regulated environment and has responded to the demands of novel therapeutics
by adapting efficient drug development processes. Complex clinical trial design expertise has emerged as a significant
competitive advantage for select CROs that have a track record of successfully navigating country-specific regulatory,
clinical trial protocol, and patient enrollment barriers, including sometimes subjective, evolving clinical endpoints.

**_Expected growth of drug commercialization market. Pharmaceutical companies also increasingly outsource critical_**
elements of drug commercialization to CCOs like us. Based on industry sources and management estimates, we
believe that the market for pharmaceutical commercial outsourcing is approximately $30 billion today and is expected
to grow approximately 7% per year through 2027.

CCO growth is expected to be driven by a combination of (i) a growing number of SMIDs and biotech companies,
who are reliant on outsourced commercialization, (ii) increasingly complex therapeutics with ever-growing
development costs that require effective and bespoke go-to-market solutions, with increased demand for field facing
teams that can engage in highly specialized conversations around complex scientific information associated with
innovative therapies, (iii) upcoming patent cliffs in the late-2020s, which will motivate pharmaceutical companies to
invest in new drug development and commercialization, (iv) an increased reliance on CCOs to help navigate drug
pricing in the face of changing regulation, (v) increased expectations for data generation and data driven insights from
pharmaceutical companies, and (vi) an evolving industry landscape illustrated by a shift to more strategic relationships,
particularly where economies of scale can reduce costs.

CCO Spend ($bn) Outsourcing Rate per Annum (% of Addressable S&M Spend)

**_Value proposition of CROs and CCOs is growing, due to the increasing need for and complexity of drug_**
**_development and commercialization. Large pharmaceutical companies are facing growing demands for new_**
products driven by upcoming patent cliffs in the late 2020s and the need for new blockbuster therapeutics to
replenish their pipeline and drive sales growth. At the same time, these companies are experiencing growing demand
for specialty drugs and a complex and evolving regulatory and political landscape, resulting in a more complicated


-----

operating environment. As a result, the ability of pharmaceutical companies to develop blockbuster therapies and
bring them to market quickly is becoming more important.

Against this backdrop, the services that CROs provide, including the ability to run complex trials for the next
generation of specialty pharmaceutical products, and the services that CCOs provide, including the ability to market
new products to as broad of an audience as possible and as early as possible, are growing in importance.

**_Rapid adoption of remote technology-enabled platforms. Accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have_**
observed an increase in the adoption of remote and digital solutions to facilitate continued healthcare delivery to
patients and support to healthcare providers for our customers’ products. Technology and data that help power siteand patient-centric solutions have been on the rise and include risk-based and remote monitoring, home health, and
virtual personal and non-personal outreach to medical facilities and clinics. As a result of this trend, pharmaceutical
companies increasingly rely on outsourcing trials from CROs with global reach and advanced technological
capabilities. This includes the implementation of DCTs, where some or all of a clinical trial’s activities occur at
locations other than a traditional clinical trial site, which can include the participant’s home, a local health care
facility, or a nearby lab. DCTs provide value by enabling accelerated patient access, improved retention, and
increased diversity. We have made key acquisitions in the DTC space in recent years, including Illingworth (DCT)
and StudyKIK (recruitment and retention), and have partnered with industry leaders such as Science 37 and
Medable, enabling us to benefit from increased momentum in the space.

**_Market participants. We are the fourth largest CRO globally by revenue. Only the six largest CROs, including_**
IQVIA, ICON, PPD, Syneos, Parexel and Fortrea (f/k/a Covance) have the scale and capabilities necessary to win
strategic partnerships with large pharmaceutical customers. The CCO market is much more fragmented with no
player having greater than 10% market share. Inizio is the largest player with approximately 6%, followed by
Syneos with 4% and Eversana and IQVIA, which each have approximately 3% share. Additional competitors in the
CCO space include Klick Health, Amplity, PMG, and Real Chemistry.

**Sales and Marketing**

Our global team of strategic business development professionals and support staff identifies needs, designs
solutions, and promotes our services to the pharmaceutical, Biotech, and medical device industries. In addition to
significant customer engagement and development experience, many of these individuals have technical and
scientific backgrounds.

Our business development organization works with our leadership team to identify, develop, and maintain key
customer relationships in addition to new business development activities. Teams use an integrated, customerfocused approach to develop joint engagement plans for key accounts. For many of our largest customer
relationships, dedicated strategic account management teams under our Global Client Solutions and Syneos One®
groups provide account leadership to meet financial goals, align delivery with strategic goals, and promote
innovation.

**Government Regulation**

The biopharmaceutical industry is subject to a high degree of governmental regulation in both domestic and
international markets. Regardless of the country or region in which approval is being sought, before a marketing


-----

application for a drug is ready for submission to regulatory authorities, the candidate drug must undergo rigorous
testing in pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. The clinical trial process must be conducted in accordance with the
Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act in the U.S. and similar laws and regulations in the relevant foreign
jurisdictions (e.g., the European Union Clinical Trials Regulation). These laws and regulations require the candidate
drug to be tested and studied in certain ways prior to submission for approval.

_Regulation of Our Clinical Solutions Segment_

In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) regulates the conduct of clinical trials of drug products in
human subjects, and the form and content of regulatory applications. The FDA also regulates the development,
approval, manufacture, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping, import, export, distribution, advertising, sale, and
marketing of drug products. The FDA has similar authority and similar requirements with respect to the clinical
testing of biological products and medical devices. In the European Union (“EU”) and other jurisdictions where our
customers intend to apply for marketing authorization (of drug products) or seek certification (of medical devices),
similar laws and regulations apply. Within the EU, these requirements are enforced by the EMA and competent
authorities of the EU member states. Additional national requirements may vary slightly from one member state to
another. In Canada, clinical trials are regulated by the Health Products Food Branch of Health Canada as well as
provincial regulations. Similar requirements also apply in other jurisdictions, including Australia, Japan, and other
Asia-Pacific countries, where we operate or where our customers intend to apply for marketing authorization.
Sponsors of clinical trials also follow the International Council on Harmonisation (“ICH”) guidelines on Good
Clinical Practice (“GCP”), which are enforced by the FDA and other comparable regulatory authorities, and may be
amended from time to time.

Our services are subject to various regulatory requirements designed to ensure the quality and integrity of the
clinical trial process. In the U.S., we must perform our clinical development services in compliance with applicable
laws, rules, and regulations, including GCP and Good Pharmacovigilance Practice, which govern, among other
things, the design, conduct, performance, monitoring, auditing, recording, analysis, and reporting of clinical trials.
Before a human clinical trial may begin, the manufacturer or sponsor of the investigational drug or biologic must
file an investigational new drug application (“IND”) with the FDA, which contains, among other things, the results
of pre-clinical tests, manufacturing information, and other analytical data. A separate submission to an existing IND
must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during asset development. Each clinical trial
conducted in the U.S. must be conducted pursuant to, and in accordance with, an effective IND. In addition, under
GCP regulations, each human clinical trial we conduct is subject to the oversight of an independent institutional
review board (“IRB”) which is an independent committee that has the regulatory authority to review, approve and
monitor a clinical trial. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on
various grounds, including a finding that the study subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.

Clinical trials conducted outside the U.S. are subject to the laws and regulations of the country where the trials are
conducted. These laws and regulations might not be similar to the laws and regulations administered by the FDA
and other laws and regulations regarding the protection of patient safety and privacy and the control of study
pharmaceuticals, medical devices or other study materials. Studies conducted outside the U.S. can also be subject
to regulation by the FDA if the studies are conducted pursuant to an IND, or in the case of a medical device, an
investigational device exemption. It is the responsibility of the study sponsor or the parties conducting the studies
to ensure that all applicable legal and regulatory requirements are fulfilled.

To comply with GCP and other regulations, we must, among other things:

    - comply with specific requirements governing the selection of qualified principal investigators and
clinical research sites;

    - obtain specific written commitments from principal investigators;

    - obtain review, approval, and supervision of the clinical trials by an IRB or ethics committee;

    - obtain favorable opinion from regulatory agencies to commence a clinical trial;


-----

    - verify that appropriate patient informed consents are obtained before the patient participates in a
clinical trial;

    - ensure that adverse drug reactions resulting from the administration of a drug or biologic during a
clinical trial are medically evaluated and reported in a timely manner;

    - monitor the validity and accuracy of data;

    - monitor drug, biologic or device accountability at clinical research sites; and

    - verify that principal investigators and study staff maintain records and reports and permit appropriate
governmental authorities access to data for review.

Similar regulations and guidelines exist in various states and in other countries. In the EU, similarly to the U.S., the
various phases of non-clinical and clinical research are subject to significant regulatory controls. Clinical trials of
medicinal products (drugs, biologics, and medical devices) that support or are intended to support applications for
research or marketing authorization must be conducted in accordance with applicable EU and national regulations
and the ICH guidelines on GCP, which are ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. If
the sponsor of a clinical trial is not established within the EU, it must appoint an EU entity to act as its legal
representative for clinical trials conducted in the EU. Non-clinical studies must be conducted in accordance with the
principles of good laboratory practice (“GLP”) as set forth in EU Directive 2004/10/EC.

Non-clinical studies are performed to demonstrate the health or environmental safety of new chemical or biological
substances. In particular, non-clinical studies, both in vitro and in vivo, must be planned, performed, monitored,
recorded, reported, and archived in accordance with the GLP principles, which define a set of rules and criteria for
a quality system for the organizational process and the conditions for non-clinical studies. These GLP standards
reflect the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development requirements.

The regulatory landscape related to clinical trials in the EU has been subject to recent changes. The EU Clinical
Trials Regulation (“CTR”), which was adopted in April 2014 and repeals the EU Clinical Trials Directive, became
applicable on January 31, 2022. Unlike directives, the CTR is directly applicable in all EU member states, as well
as Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland, without the need for member states to further implement it into national
law. The CTR notably harmonizes the assessment and supervision processes for clinical trials throughout the EU
via a Clinical Trials Information System, which contains a centralized EU portal and database.

The UK left the EU on January 31, 2020, following which existing EU medicinal product legislation continued to
apply in the UK during the transition period under the terms of the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement. As of January 1,
2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”) is the UK’s standalone medicines and
medical devices regulator. EU laws that have been transposed into UK law through secondary legislation continue to
be applicable as “retained EU law.” However, new legislation such as the EU CTR is not applicable. The UK
government has passed a new Medicines and Medical Devices Act 2021, which introduces delegated powers in
favor of the Secretary of State or an ‘appropriate authority’ to amend or supplement existing regulations in the area
of medicinal products and medical devices. This allows new rules to be introduced in the future by way of secondary
legislation, which aims to allow flexibility in addressing regulatory gaps and future changes in the fields of human
medicines, clinical trials, and medical devices.

We may be subject to regulatory action if we fail to comply with applicable rules and regulations. Failure to comply
with certain regulations can also result in the termination of ongoing research and disqualification of data collected
during the clinical trials. For example, violations of GCP could result, depending on the nature of the violation and
the type of product involved, in the issuance of a warning letter, suspension or termination of a clinical study,
refusal of the FDA or other comparable regulatory authorities to approve clinical trial or marketing applications or
withdrawal of such applications, injunction, seizure of investigational products, civil penalties, criminal
prosecutions, or debarment from assisting in the submission of new drug applications. See “Risk Factors – Risks
Related to Our Business – If we fail to perform our services in accordance with contractual requirements, regulatory
requirements, and ethical considerations, we could be subject to significant costs, liability, or regulatory
enforcement actions, and our reputation could be harmed.”


-----

We monitor our clinical trials to test for compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the U.S. and the foreign
jurisdictions in which we operate. We have adopted standard operating procedures that are designed to satisfy
regulatory requirements and serve as a mechanism for controlling and enhancing the quality of our clinical trials. In
the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions where we operate, our procedures were developed to ensure compliance with
GCP and associated guidelines.

In addition to its comprehensive regulation of safety in the workplace, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health
Administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for healthcare employers
whose workers might be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and the hepatitis virus. Furthermore,
certain employees might have to receive initial and periodic training to ensure compliance with applicable
hazardous materials regulations and health and safety guidelines. We are subject to similar regulations in Canada
and Spain.

_Regulation of Our Commercial Solutions Segment_

The safety of medicines continues to be monitored after drug product approvals and throughout their use in
healthcare practice. Post-marketing safety surveillance is therefore also subject to FDA regulations as well as
the EU pharmacovigilance legislation and other countries’ regulations.

In addition, our field personnel are subject to all laws, rules and regulations governing the promotion of
pharmaceutical products in the U.S. and in every other country where such personnel perform work. In particular,
these rules and regulations include limitations on the indications for which a product may be promoted and on
promotional spending. Additionally, these laws, rules and regulations govern the manner in which the product may
be promoted, and the scientific exchange of information related to the product. Violations of these rules may leave
us at risk of direct regulatory enforcement action and/or cause us to be in breach of contract with our customers.

Some of our field personnel handle and distribute samples of pharmaceutical products. In the U.S., the handling and
distribution of prescription drug product samples are subject to regulation under the Prescription Drug Marketing
Act and other applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations and other countries may have similar laws or
regulations. These laws and regulations regulate the distribution of drug samples by mandating procedures for
storage and record-keeping requirements for drug samples and ban the purchase or sale of drug samples. Further,
we must comply with the requirements of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, which regulates the
distribution, record-keeping, handling, security, and disposal of controlled substances.

Our communications offerings are subject to all regulatory risks applicable to similar communications businesses as
well as risks that relate specifically to the provision of these services to the biopharmaceutical industry. Such
regulatory risks include enforcement by the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S., Health Canada, the
Department of Health in the UK, competent authorities of the EU member states, as well as state agencies and other
foreign regulators enforcing laws relating to product advertising, false advertising, and unfair and deceptive trade
practices. In addition to enforcement actions initiated by government agencies, there has been an increasing
tendency in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions among biopharmaceutical companies to resort to the courts and
industry and self-regulatory bodies to challenge comparative prescription drug advertising on the grounds that the
advertising is false and deceptive. There continues to be an expansion of specific rules, prohibitions, media
restrictions, labeling disclosures, and warning requirements with respect to the advertising for certain products.

_Data Protection Regulation_

We are subject to data protection laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate that address the privacy,
security, and other processing of personal information. These laws and regulations govern the collection, use,
handling, and disclosure of health-related and other personal information and require that we adopt and maintain
reasonable and appropriate security measures that are designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity and
availability of the information. These laws and regulations also typically require the adoption and maintenance of
procedures that facilitate the exercise of an individual’s rights with respect to the information about them. Certain
of these laws may also contain requirements relating to the location of the personal information, or the transfer of
personal information from one country or region to other countries. Examples of data protection laws and
regulations to which we may be subject include Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic


-----

Documents Act, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (“EU GDPR”), the UK General Data Protection
Regulation and Data Protection Act 2018 (the “UK GDPR” and, together with the EU GDPR, “GDPR”), and the
California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”). We are also subject to evolving EU and UK privacy laws on cookies,
tracking technologies, and e-marketing. For additional information regarding these laws and regulations and their
potential impacts on our business, see “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business – Current and proposed laws
and regulations regarding the protection of personal data could result in increased risks of liability or increased cost
to us or could limit our service offerings.”

**Intellectual Property**

We develop and use a number of proprietary methodologies, analytics, systems, technologies, and other intellectual
property in the conduct of our business. We rely upon a combination of confidentiality policies, nondisclosure
agreements, and other contractual arrangements to protect our trade secrets, and patent, copyright, and trademark
laws to protect other intellectual property rights. We have obtained or applied for patents, trademarks, and copyright
protection in the U.S. and in a number of foreign countries. Our material trademarks include Trusted Process[®],
PlanActivation[®], QuickStart[®], ProgramAccelerate[®], QualityFinish[®], Shortening the distance from lab to life[®],
Syneos One[®], Dynamic Assembly[®], Kinetic[TM], Syneos Health[®], and other corporate emblems. Although the
duration of our intellectual property rights varies from country to country, trademarks generally may be renewed
indefinitely so long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained, and so long as they have not
been found to have become generic. Although we believe that the ownership of trademarks is an important factor in
our business and that our success does depend in part on the ownership thereof, we rely primarily on the innovative
skills, technical competence, and marketing abilities of our employees. We do not have any material patents,
licenses, franchises, or concessions.

**Human Capital Resources**

As of June 30, 2023, we had 29,197 employees. Of these, 28,487 employees were regular and 710 were temporary.
An additional 374 contingent workers provided services for us.

_Our Culture and Values. Our culture remains the cornerstone of all our human capital programs. Our shared_
purpose, Shortening the distance from lab to life[®], aligns our employees and the customers we serve. This
environment is fueled by a belief in caring for our collective well-being, which we refer to as Total Self. This belief
enables employees to be their authentic selves at work, fostering a diverse, equitable, and inclusive culture where
employees are empowered.

_Safety and Health. The safety, health, and welfare of our employees are paramount to us. Our global Health and_
Safety team, with regional and operational expertise, provides for the health and safety of our employees, regardless
of where they work or what they do. To support our Health and Safety professionals, we have selected and are
implementing a software toolset to support our health and safety efforts. This newly organized team and new
toolsets will enable our Health and Safety program to be metrics based with targeted improvements, both as the
regulatory environment changes and year over year.

We have also activated our Business Continuity and Crisis Response team to help cultivate the safety of our
employees in conflict zones across the world, particularly in Ukraine. This team began its work in December of
2021 and was fully prepared to offer employees support in an effort to promote safety for themselves and their
families. These efforts include financial and relocation assistance, alternative working arrangements, information
sharing from our intelligence partners (such as near real time border crossing wait times and procedures), and direct
access to the Business Continuity and Crisis Response team to ensure employees’ needs are met to the best of our
ability. We continue to provide this support to ensure our employees have the highest level of care that we can
provide as an organization.

_Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (“DE&I”). We strive to lead our industry in our DE&I efforts both internally and_
externally. We believe that addressing complex healthcare challenges requires contributions from diverse
viewpoints and an inclusive, equitable space where our employees can achieve their highest potential. We strive to
foster a work environment that includes and embraces racial, ethnic, and gender diversity and other individual
differences. Our policies prohibit unlawful discrimination based on race, color, creed, gender, religion, marital
status, age, national origin or ancestry, genetic information, physical or mental disability, medical condition, sexual


-----

orientation, gender expression or identity, or any other characteristic protected by applicable law. The emphasis
placed on DE&I by us and by our Board of Directors (“Board”) is demonstrated by the inclusion of DE&I updates
and metrics in the materials for each regular meeting of the Compensation and Management Development
Committee of the Board. In 2022, we also created an internal Diversity Action Collab, a peer-to-peer knowledgesharing forum led by the Chief Scientific Officer, and an external DE&I Advisory Council where we provide our
customers with actionable insights and top-tier expertise to navigate complex regulatory guidelines and mandates,
and achieve corporate, healthcare, and other business initiatives.

As of June 30, 2023, 68% of our total workforce, 64% of our global new hires, and 57% of our global management
roles at the Director level and above identify as women. As of June 30, 2023, 34% of our U.S. workforce, 38% of
our U.S. new hires, and 22% of our U.S. management roles at the Director level and above identified as part of a
traditionally underrepresented racial or ethnic group. Our DE&I strategy is managed by our DE&I Council, which
oversees and strategically plans for diversity and inclusion within our organization under three pillars of focus:
People, Customer, and Community.

Throughout 2022, we grew our existing Employee Resource Group (“ERG”) ecosystem across the globe to eight
ERGs and one business community: Asian, Black, ConeXion (for our LatinX community), Developing
Professionals (for both early and progressing talent), LGBTQIA+, Persons with Disabilities, Women, Veterans,
and RISE (Realizing Inclusivity & Success through Inclusivity) within our commercial business. These ERGs
further honor our equitable and inclusive Total Self environment by building, supporting, and creating visibility
and engagement opportunities for our internal communities.

We maintain a zero-tolerance policy on discrimination and harassment and have several programs under
which employees can report incidents in good faith confidentially or anonymously, and without fear of
reprisal.

_Recruitment, Retention and Development. The primary ways we recruit and retain employees are by (1) providing_
compensation and benefits that are competitive in our industry and in local labor markets, (2) designing our
leadership and development programs to support our culture and values while preparing our people for the future,
and (3) maintaining an effective service delivery model conducive to work-life balance and employee needs.

Our Global Talent Acquisition team leverages numerous resources including industry networks, online and social
media platforms, university relations, and industry-focused career events to source talent for open positions.
Candidates are thoroughly screened and evaluated against job-specific skills, experience, and education criteria. We
continuously work at improving our candidate experience, which has been recognized seven times with a North
American Candidate Experience Award, awarded by the Talent Board for excellence in Talent Acquisition.

In 2021, we introduced our Enabling our Talent Advantage (“ETA”) program that concentrates on increased
demand for clinical resources with an ultimate focus on our talent acquisition and retention strategies. In 2022,
the ETA program has resulted in a new agile talent acquisition operating model, identified opportunities for
automation that elevate candidate and hiring manager experiences, and developed external talent community
strategies that deliver real-time talent pools for critical in-demand skill sets. In addition, the ETA program has
improved our internal mobility policy, developing feeder pools for key roles in support of our early talent strategy
and developing a line manager curriculum to better and more simply equip managers to support our workforce.
As an operational example of the ETA program’s impact, in the first six months of 2022, we successfully
recruited, hired, and integrated approximately 500 entry level CRA’s, dramatically expanding our site monitoring
capabilities and preparedness.

We offer extensive, award-winning training programs that provide regulatory, business, foreign language,
leadership, and management training and other opportunities for professional and personal development. As part of
our empowered employee experience, we offer a suite of tools to assist employees to own their careers and aim to
reach their highest professional potential. As an organization with services spanning clinical and commercial as
well as numerous corporate functions, we encourage and enable internal mobility to support retention.

We regularly evaluate our compensation and benefit programs using external market data and feedback from our
Global Talent Acquisition team and have established processes to make necessary revisions. Our Total Rewards


-----

team introduced a new global salary structure to drive consistent enterprise-wide compensation and job level
practices, ensuring our compensation remains competitive in the many countries in which our employees reside.

_Listening to our Employees. We are an agile and continuous learning organization, listening to employees at all_
levels – particularly at key moments that matter – and harvesting actionable insights to shape the employee
experience. A key element of our listening strategy includes purposeful pulse surveys designed to check on key
audiences at key moments. Overall, our listening includes our employee engagement survey and regular employee
lifecycle surveys, including onboarding (following the first week and at 90 days of employment) and exit surveys.
Ultimately, we leverage these insights to inform and improve our employee programs and services.

**Legal Proceedings**

We are party to legal proceedings incidental to our business. While our management currently believes the ultimate
outcome of these proceedings, other than certain proceedings relating to the Merger, individually and in the
aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements, litigation is subject to
inherent uncertainties. Were an unfavorable ruling to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact
on our financial condition and results of operations.

Please refer to “Note 15 – Commitments and Contingencies” of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements for the six months ended June 30, 2023 included elsewhere in this offering circular for information
pertaining to legal proceedings.

-----

**DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN OTHER INDEBTEDNESS**

**New Credit Facilities**

To finance the Merger and related transactions, we intend to enter into the New Credit Agreement and the
New Credit Facilities thereunder, which provides for the New Term Facility and the New Revolving Facility.
Affiliates of each of the initial purchasers will be lenders under the New Credit Facilities.

**_Interest Rate and Fees_**

Borrowings under the New Credit Agreement will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to an applicable
margin plus, at our option, either (i) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (x) the federal funds
effective rate plus 0.50%, (y) the rate of interest in effect for such day last quoted by The Wall Street Journal as the
“prime rate” in the U.S. and (z) SOFR for a one-month interest period published for such day by the CME Group
Benchmark Administration Limited, as the administrator of the benchmark (or a successor administrator), plus
1.00%; or (ii) Term SOFR, as further set forth in the final New Credit Agreement. The applicable margin for
borrowings under the New Credit Facilities will be subject to adjustment each fiscal quarter based on our first lien
net leverage ratio and ranges to be agreed and set forth in the final New Credit Agreement. In addition to paying
interest on outstanding principal under the New Credit Facilities (subject to step-downs in respect of the New Credit
Facilities based on our first lien leverage ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter), we will pay customary agency fees
and a commitment fee in respect of the unutilized commitments under the New Revolving Facility to be agreed and
set forth in the final New Credit Agreement.

**_Mandatory Repayments_**

The New Credit Agreement is expected to require us to prepay outstanding loans under the New Term
Facility, subject to certain exceptions and thresholds, with: (1) 100% of the net cash proceeds of any incurrence of
debt not permitted under the New Credit Agreement and debt incurred to refinance the New Credit Facilities,
(2) 50% (which percentage may be reduced to 25% and 0% if our first lien leverage ratio is less than or equal to
specified levels) of our annual excess cash flow (as defined in the New Credit Agreement) minus certain deductions
applicable thereto and (3) 100% (which percentage may be reduced to 50% and 0% if our first lien leverage ratio is
less than or equal to specified levels) of the net cash proceeds of certain non-ordinary course asset sales or other
dispositions of property by Holdings or by any of its restricted subsidiaries, subject to reinvestment rights and
certain other exceptions and thresholds.

**_Voluntary Repayments_**

We expect to be able to voluntarily prepay outstanding loans under the New Credit Facilities at any time
without premium or penalty, other than a premium of 1.00% applicable to any prepayment of the New Term Facility
that is made in connection with a “repricing transaction” that occurs on or prior to the 6-month anniversary of the
effective date of the New Credit Facilities, subject to certain exceptions.

**_Amortization and Final Maturity_**

The New Term Facility is expected to amortize at 1% per annum in equal quarterly installments, with the
balance payable in 2030, at the time the New Term Facility matures. The New Revolving Facility will mature in
2028 and will not include amortization.

**_Guarantees and Security_**

The obligations under the New Credit Facilities are expected to be unconditionally guaranteed by Holdings
and certain of the Issuer’s direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries.


-----

All obligations under the New Credit Facilities, and the guarantees of those obligations, are expected to be
secured, subject to certain exceptions, by:

    - a pledge of 100% of the capital stock of the Issuer and each guarantor, subject to certain exceptions;
and

    - a security interest in substantially all other tangible and intangible assets of the Issuer and each
guarantor, subject to certain exceptions.

The liens securing our obligations under the New Credit Facilities are expected to be first priority liens on
all of the relevant assets of the Issuer and the guarantors, subject to customary exceptions and liens permitted under
the New Credit Facilities.

**_Certain Covenants and Events of Default_**

The New Credit Facilities are expected to contain a number of covenants that, among other things and
subject to certain exceptions and thresholds, restrict the ability of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to, among
others:

    - incur additional indebtedness, including capital leases;

    - pay dividends on capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire capital stock or other indebtedness;

    - make investments, loans, advances and acquisitions;

    - enter into burdensome agreements with negative pledge clauses or clauses restricting subsidiary
distributions;

    - engage in transactions with our affiliates;

    - sell assets, including the capital stock of our subsidiaries;

    - consolidate or merge; and

    - create liens.

The New Credit Agreement is expected to also contain a customary passive holding company covenant
applicable to Holdings.

The New Credit Agreement is also expected to contain a financial covenant, solely with respect to the New
Revolving Facility, of a maximum first lien leverage ratio set forth in the New Credit Agreement, which financial
covenant shall spring into effect while outstanding loans under the New Revolving Facility exceed a certain
threshold.

The New Credit Agreement is also expected to also contain certain events of default, subject to cure
provisions and trigger thresholds, including payment defaults, failure to perform or observe covenants, crossdefaults with certain other events of default in connection with our other material indebtedness, a change of control
and certain bankruptcy events, among others.

**Debt Refinancing**

In connection with the Merger, it is expected that (i) all of the outstanding loans under the Existing Credit
Agreement will be repaid in full (and the guarantees by and security interests in the assets of the Company and
certain of its subsidiaries thereunder will be released); (ii) the Existing Notes will be redeemed in full and (iii) the


-----

Receivables Financing Agreement will be repaid in full (and the security interests in the assets of the borrower
thereunder will be released). This offering circular does not constitute a redemption notice under the indenture
governing the Existing Notes. See “Summary—The Transactions” and “Use of Proceeds” for more information
regarding the Debt Refinancing.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

The following is a description of the $1,700,000,000 aggregate principal amount of      % senior secured
notes due 2030 of Star Parent, Inc. (the “Secured Notes”). In this description, (i) the terms “we,” “our” and “us” each
refer (a) prior to the consummation of the Merger, to Star Parent, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), and
not to any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries, and (b) from and after the consummation of the Merger, to the Company
and its consolidated Subsidiaries taken together; (ii) the term “Company” refers only to Star Parent, Inc. and not any
of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries; and (iii) the term “Parent” refers only to Star Holdings, Inc. and not any of its
Affiliates or Subsidiaries. Certain terms used in this description are defined under the subheading “—Certain
Definitions.”

The Company will issue the Secured Notes under an indenture (the “Secured Indenture”) to be dated as of
the Issue Date between the Company, Parent and Citibank, N.A., a national banking association organized and
existing under the laws of the United States, acting through its Agency & Trust business not in its individual
capacity but solely in its respective capacities as trustee (in such capacity, the “Trustee”) and notes collateral agent
(in such capacity, the “Notes Collateral Agent”). If applicable, on the Issue Date, the gross proceeds from this
offering of Secured Notes will be deposited into escrow pursuant to certain customary escrow arrangements as set
forth in the Escrow Agreement (as defined below). Such gross proceeds will be released therefrom upon the
satisfaction of certain conditions. For more information about the terms of the escrow arrangements and special
mandatory redemption feature, see “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.” On the Completion
Date (as defined below), the gross proceeds will be released from escrow, and the Subsidiary Guarantors (as defined
below) will execute a supplemental indenture pursuant to which the Subsidiary Guarantors will provide a guarantee
of the Secured Notes, and the Subsidiary Guarantors will become parties to the Secured Indenture and the applicable
Notes Collateral Documents. If the Merger will be consummated on the Issue Date, the Company will issue the
Secured Notes, and the Guarantors, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent will enter into the Secured Indenture
and the applicable Notes Collateral Documents.

The Secured Notes will be issued in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements
of the Securities Act. See “Transfer Restrictions.” The Secured Notes are subject to all such terms pursuant to the
provisions of the Secured Indenture, and Holders are referred to the Secured Indenture for a statement thereof.

The following is a summary of the material provisions of the Secured Indenture and the Escrow
Agreement. Because this is a summary, it may not contain all the information that is important to you. You should
read the Secured Indenture and the Escrow Agreement in their entirety. Copies of the proposed forms of the Secured
Indenture and the Escrow Agreement may be requested as described under “Where You Can Find Additional
Information.” You can find the definitions of certain terms used in this description under “—Certain Definitions.”
The capitalized terms defined in “—Certain Definitions” below are used in this “Description of the Notes” as so
defined.

The Company does not intend to list the Secured Notes on any securities exchange. The Company will not
be required to, nor does the Company currently intend to, offer to exchange the Secured Notes for notes registered
under the Securities Act or otherwise register or qualify by prospectus the Secured Notes for resale under the
Securities Act. The Secured Indenture will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act or subject to the terms of
the Trust Indenture Act. Accordingly, the terms of the Secured Notes include only those stated in the Secured
Indenture.

**Brief Description of the Secured Notes and the Note Guarantees**

Prior to the Completion Date if the Merger is not consummated on the Issue Date, the Secured Notes will
(a) only be secured by a first-priority security interest in the Escrow Account (as defined below) and all funds on


-----

deposit therein (as set forth under “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption”) and (b) only be
unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by Parent.

From and after the Completion Date, the Secured Notes will be the Company’s senior secured obligations
and will be:

    - secured on a first-priority basis by the Collateral on a pari passu basis with the First Lien Credit
Agreement and all future Indebtedness of the Company secured by a first-priority lien on the
Collateral;

    - _pari passu in right of payment with all of the Company’s existing and future senior Indebtedness,_
including Indebtedness under the First Lien Credit Agreement;

    - effectively senior to all the Company’s existing and future Indebtedness that is unsecured or that is
secured with Junior Lien Priority on the Collateral, to the extent of the value of the Collateral;

    - senior in right of payment to any of the Company’s future Subordinated Indebtedness;

    - effectively subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness of the Company that is secured by
Liens on assets that do not constitute Collateral, to the extent of the value of such assets;

    - unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis, jointly and severally, by each Guarantor;
and

    - structurally subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness and other liabilities of any
subsidiary that does not guarantee the Secured Notes, including certain of the Company’s Foreign
Subsidiaries.

From and after the Completion Date, each Note Guarantee (as defined below) will be each Guarantor’s
senior secured obligation and will be:

    - secured on a first-priority basis by the Collateral on a pari passu basis with the First Lien Credit
Agreement and all future Indebtedness of such Guarantor secured by a first-priority lien on the
Collateral;

    - _pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor,_
including its guarantee of Indebtedness under the First Lien Credit Agreement;

    - effectively pari passu with the Guarantee of such Guarantor under all existing and future
Indebtedness of such Guarantor secured by a first-priority Lien on the Collateral, including the
First Lien Credit Agreement;

    - effectively senior to all of such Guarantor’s existing and future Indebtedness that is unsecured or
that is secured with Junior Lien Priority on the Collateral to the extent of the value of the
Collateral;

    - effectively subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is secured
by Liens on assets that do not constitute Collateral, to the extent of the value of such assets;

    - senior in right of payment to any future Subordinated Indebtedness of such Guarantor; and


-----

    - structurally subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness and other liabilities, including
preferred stock, of any Subsidiaries of such Guarantor that are not Guarantors.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Company will issue the Secured Notes in minimum denominations of $2,000 and in integral multiples
of $1,000 in excess thereof. The rights of Holders of beneficial interests in the Secured Notes to receive the
payments on such Secured Notes are subject to the applicable procedures of DTC. If the due date for any payment in
respect of any Secured Notes is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder
thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and
will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

The Company will issue an aggregate principal amount of $1,700,000,000 of Secured Notes on the Issue
Date. The Secured Notes will mature on    , 2030. Interest on the Secured Notes will accrue at the rate of     %
per annum and will be payable, in cash, semi-annually in arrears on    and    of each year, commencing on   ,
2024, to Holders of record on the immediately preceding    and  , respectively. Interest on the Secured Notes
will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from the Issue
Date. If the Company delivers global notes to the Trustee for cancellation on a date that is after the record date and
on or before the corresponding interest payment date, then interest shall be paid in accordance with the applicable
procedures of DTC. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.
Each interest period will end on (but not include) the relevant interest payment date.

**Additional Secured Notes**

The Company may issue additional Secured Notes (the “Additional Secured Notes”) from time to time
under the Secured Indenture. The Secured Indenture will provide for the issuance of Additional Secured Notes
having identical terms and conditions to the Secured Notes offered hereby, subject to compliance with the covenants
contained in the Secured Indenture. It is intended, to the maximum extent possible, that any such Additional Secured
Notes will be part of the same issue as the Secured Notes offered hereby under the Secured Indenture for all
purposes, including waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase; provided that Additional Secured
Notes will not be issued with the same CUSIP as the Secured Notes offered hereby unless such Additional Secured
Notes are fungible with the Secured Notes offered hereby for U.S. federal income Tax purposes. Any issuance of
Additional Secured Notes will be subject to the covenant described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Indebtedness.”

**Payments**

Principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on the Secured Notes will be payable at the office or agency
of the Company maintained for such purpose (along with any other paying agent maintained by the Company, the
“Paying Agent”) or, at the option of the Paying Agent, payment of interest, if any, may be made by check mailed to
the Holders of the Secured Notes at their respective addresses set forth in the register of Holders or by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the Holders of the Secured Notes provided that all
payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to Secured Notes represented by one or more
global notes registered in the name of or held by DTC or its nominee will be made by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the accounts specified by the Holders thereof. Until otherwise designated by the Company, the
Company’s office or agency maintained for such purpose will be the office of the Trustee.

**Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption**

This offering of the Secured Notes may be consummated prior to the consummation of the Merger. Unless the
Merger will be consummated on the Issue Date, on the Issue Date, the Company will enter into an escrow agreement
(as amended, supplemented or modified from time to time, the “Escrow Agreement”) among the Company, the
Trustee and Citibank, N.A., a national banking association organized and existing under the laws of the United


-----

States, acting through its Agency & Trust business not in its individual capacity but solely as escrow agent (in such
capacity, together with its successors, the “Escrow Agent”), pursuant to which an amount equal to the gross proceeds
of the offering of the Secured Notes sold on the Issue Date will be deposited into an escrow account (the “Escrow
_Account”). By its acceptance of the Secured Notes, each Holder shall be deemed to authorize and direct the Trustee_
to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Escrow Agreement.

The Escrow Account will not include cash to fund any accrued and unpaid interest owing to Holders of the
Secured Notes, which is included in the Special Mandatory Redemption Price (as defined below). In the event that
the Special Mandatory Redemption Price payable upon a Special Mandatory Redemption (as defined below) for the
Secured Notes exceeds the amount of the Escrowed Property (as defined below), the Sponsors (directly or through
one or more of their respective Affiliates) will be required to fund the difference between the applicable Special
Mandatory Redemption Price and the amount of the Escrowed Property, plus the fees and expenses of the Trustee,
the Notes Collateral Agent and the Escrow Agent, pursuant to a commitment provided by them.

The initial funds deposited in the Escrow Account, and all other funds, securities, interest, dividends,
distributions, earnings and other property and payments credited to the Escrow Account in connection with the
Secured Notes (less any property and/or funds paid in accordance with the Escrow Agreement), are referred to,
collectively, as the “Escrowed Property.” The Escrowed Property will be controlled by the Escrow Agent on behalf
of the Trustee and the Holders of the Secured Notes. Interest will be calculated in accordance with the terms of the
Secured Indenture and the Secured Notes.

Other than in connection with the payment of a semi-annual interest payment as set forth under “—Principal,
Maturity and Interest,” the Company will only be entitled to cause the Escrow Agent to release the Escrowed
Property (in which case the Escrowed Property will be paid to, or as directed by, the Company) (the “Escrow
_Release”) upon delivery to the Escrow Agent, on or prior to November 17, 2023 (the “Escrow Outside Date”), of an_
Officer’s Certificate (the “Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate”), upon which the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to
rely absolutely without further investigation, to the effect that:

(1) the Merger will be consummated substantially concurrently with or promptly following the Escrow
Release;

(2) the First Lien Credit Agreement has become effective or will become effective substantially
concurrently with or promptly following the Escrow Release; and

(3) (A) the Subsidiary Guarantors have become, or will become substantially concurrently with or
promptly following the Escrow Release, by supplemental indenture, parties to the Secured Indenture and
(B) the Subsidiary Guarantors have executed, or will execute substantially concurrently with or promptly
following the Escrow Release, the Notes Collateral Documents.

The Escrow Release will occur promptly following the receipt by the Escrow Agent of the Escrow Release
Officer’s Certificate (the date of the Escrow Release (which shall also be the date that the Merger is consummated),
the “Completion Date”). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the Merger has been consummated
substantially concurrently with the consummation of the offering of the Secured Notes, the “Completion Date” shall
mean the Issue Date. Upon the Escrow Release, the Escrowed Property will be paid out of the Escrow Account in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement and the Escrow Account will be reduced to zero.

The Company will grant the Trustee, for its benefit and the benefit of the Notes Collateral Agent and the
Holders, subject to certain liens of the Escrow Agent, a first-priority security interest in the Escrow Account to
secure the payment of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price of the Secured Notes; provided, however, that such
liens and security interest shall automatically be released and terminate at such time as the Escrowed Property is
released from the Escrow Account on the Completion Date. For the avoidance of doubt, such liens and security
interest will be permitted under the Secured Indenture. The Escrow Agent will invest the Escrowed Property as


-----

directed by the Company in such short-term liquid investments (including bank deposit products) as permitted under
the Escrow Agreement, and liquidate such investments as the Company will from time to time direct in writing. In
the absence of a written investment direction, the Escrowed Property will remain invested in cash.

In the event that (i) the Escrow Outside Date occurs and the Escrow Agent shall not have received the Escrow
Release Officer’s Certificate on or prior to such date, (ii) the Company informs the Escrow Agent in writing that, in
the reasonable judgment of the Company, the Merger will not be consummated on or prior to the Escrow Outside
Date or (iii) the Company informs the Escrow Agent in writing that the Merger Agreement was terminated prior to
the Escrow Outside Date (the date of any such event being the “Special Termination Date”), the Company will
redeem the Secured Notes (the “Special Mandatory Redemption”) at a price (the “Special Mandatory Redemption
_Price”) equal to 100% of the initial issue price of the Secured Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Secured_
Notes, if any, from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from the
Issue Date to, but excluding, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below).

Notice of the Special Mandatory Redemption will be delivered by the Company to the Trustee and the Escrow
Agent no later than one Business Day following the Special Termination Date, and will provide that the Secured
Notes shall be redeemed on a date that is no later than the third Business Day after such notice is given by the
Company (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Date”) in accordance with the terms of the Secured Indenture or
otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC. On or prior to the Special Mandatory Redemption
Date, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Trustee for payment to each Holder of Secured Notes the applicable Special
Mandatory Redemption Price for such Holder’s Secured Notes and the fees and expenses of the Trustee, the Notes
Collateral Agent and the Escrow Agent and, concurrently with such payments, deliver any excess Escrowed
Property (if any) to the Company.

If the Merger will be consummated on the Issue Date, the Company will issue the Secured Notes, and the
Guarantors, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent will enter into the Secured Indenture and the applicable
Notes Collateral Documents.

**Activities Prior to the Escrow Release**

Prior to the Completion Date, the Company’s primary activities will be restricted to issuing the Secured Notes,
issuing capital stock and receiving capital contributions, performing its obligations in respect of the Secured Notes,
the Secured Indenture, the Escrow Agreement, and the purchase agreement relating to the Secured Notes, engaging
in activities in connection with entering into the First Lien Credit Agreement, performing its obligations under the
Merger Agreement, consummating the Transactions and the Escrow Release, redeeming the Secured Notes as set
forth above under the caption “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption” and conducting such other
activities as are related to the foregoing or are necessary, appropriate or desirable to effectuate the Transactions and
the transactions related thereto.

Prior to the Completion Date, the Subsidiary Guarantors will not be parties to the Secured Indenture.
Accordingly, prior to the Completion Date, the Subsidiary Guarantors and their respective Subsidiaries will not be
subject to the restrictions, agreements or covenants in the Secured Indenture.

If the Merger will be consummated on the Issue Date, the Company will issue the Secured Notes, and the
Guarantors, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent will enter into the Secured Indenture and the applicable
Notes Collateral Documents.

**Guarantees**

Prior to the Completion Date if the Merger is not consummated on the Issue Date, the Company and Parent
will be the only obligors with respect to the Secured Notes with Parent constituting the only Guarantor of the
Secured Notes during such time. From and after the Completion Date, the obligations of the Company under the


-----

Secured Notes and the Secured Indenture will be, jointly and severally, unconditionally guaranteed on a senior
secured basis (the “Note Guarantees”) by Parent and each existing Subsidiary and future Subsidiary, in each case
that Guarantees the Company’s obligations under the First Lien Credit Agreement (or otherwise becomes a borrower
thereunder) or that guarantees or becomes a borrower or issuer of certain other indebtedness of the Company or any
Guarantor, subject to release as provided in this “Description of the Notes.” Following the Completion Date, certain
Subsidiaries will be required to Guarantee the Secured Notes to the extent described in “—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Guarantees.”

On a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries generated
approximately 32.9% of our consolidated revenues and 33.8% of EBITDA for the twelve months ended June 30,
2023, and held approximately 19.9% of our consolidated assets and had no debt for borrowed money outstanding as
of June 30, 2023, in each case after intercompany eliminations.

Each Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s
obligations subject to avoidance under applicable law as a fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or unjust
preference, including provisions of the Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law or
provincial law to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a
Guarantor’s obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the
Secured Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—
Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws may permit a court to
void the Notes or the related guarantees and any related security, and if that occurs, you may not receive any
payments on the Notes.”

The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged
upon:

(1) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (including by
way of merger, amalgamation, consolidation, dividend, distribution or otherwise) of all of the
Capital Stock of such Guarantor or the sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition, of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Guarantor, in either case to a Person other than to the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary and as otherwise not prohibited by the Secured Indenture;

(2) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, the designation in accordance with the Secured Indenture of
the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or the occurrence of any event after which the
Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary;

(3) defeasance or discharge of the Secured Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction
and Discharge”;

(4) such Guarantor being (or being substantially concurrently) released or discharged from all of (i) its
obligations under all of its Guarantees of payment by the Company of any Indebtedness of the
Company under the First Lien Credit Agreement or (ii) in the case of a Note Guarantee made by a
Guarantor as a result of its guarantee of other Indebtedness of the Company or a Guarantor
pursuant to the covenant entitled “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees,” by the
Company or the applicable Guarantor of the relevant Indebtedness, except in the case of clause (i)
or (ii), a release as a result of payment under such Guarantee (it being understood that a release
subject to a contingent reinstatement is still considered a release);

(5) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, upon the merger, amalgamation or consolidation of any
Guarantor with and into the Company or another Guarantor or upon the liquidation of such
Guarantor, in each case, in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Secured Indenture;

(6) upon the achievement of Investment Grade Status by the Secured Notes; provided that such Note
Guarantee shall be reinstated upon the Reversion Date; and


-----

(7) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers.”

Claims of creditors of Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, secured creditors and
creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority
stockholders (if any) of those Subsidiaries and claims against joint ventures generally will have priority with respect
to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries and joint ventures over the claims of creditors of the Company,
including Holders of the Secured Notes. The Secured Notes and each Note Guarantee therefor will be structurally
subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries
of the Company (other than the Guarantors) and joint ventures. Although the Secured Indenture limits the incurrence
of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a
number of significant exceptions.

Moreover, the Secured Indenture does not impose any limitation on the incurrence by Restricted
Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the
Secured Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

**Security for the Secured Notes**

**_Collateral Generally_**

On the Completion Date, the Secured Notes and the Guarantees thereof will be secured on a pari passu
basis with the First Lien Credit Agreement Obligations by perfected first-priority security interests in the same
assets and property of the Company and the Guarantors that secure the First Lien Credit Agreement Obligations.
The First Lien Secured Parties other than the Holders have rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral that, if
exercised, could also adversely affect the value of the Collateral benefiting the Holders, particularly the rights
described below under “—First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.”

The Company and the Guarantors are and will be able to incur additional Indebtedness in the future which
could share in the Collateral, including Additional First Lien Obligations, Junior Lien Obligations and other
Obligations secured by Permitted Liens. With respect to the Company and the Guarantors, the amount of such
Additional First Lien Obligations, Junior Lien Obligations and such additional Obligations will be limited by the
covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Liens.” Under certain circumstances, the amount of any such Additional First Lien Obligations, Junior
Lien Obligations and such additional Obligations could be significant.

**_Certain limitations on the Collateral_**

The Collateral securing the Secured Notes will not include any of the following assets (the “Excluded
_Property”): (A) any real property or real property interests (including, without limitation, all leasehold interests in_
real property) except for Material Real Property; (B) any lease, license or other agreement or any property subject to
a purchase money security interest, capital lease or similar agreement, in each case, to the extent permitted to be
incurred or provided under the First Lien Credit Agreement, the Secured Indenture and each other applicable Note
Document to the extent and for so long as the grant of a security interest therein would violate or invalidate such
lease, license or agreement, purchase money security interest, capital lease or a similar arrangement or create a right
of termination in favor of any other Person thereto (other than the Company or a Guarantor or their Affiliates) after
giving effect to the applicable anti-assignment provisions of the UCC or similar other applicable law, other than
proceeds and receivables thereof, the assignment of which is expressly deemed effective under the UCC or other
similar applicable law notwithstanding such prohibition; (C) any governmental licenses or state or local franchises,
charters and authorizations, to the extent security interests in such licenses, franchises, charters or authorizations are
prohibited or restricted thereby (except to the extent such prohibition or restriction is ineffective under the UCC or
other applicable law); (D) any general intangible (other than Capital Stock), investment property (other than Capital
Stock) or rights of the Company or a Guarantor arising under any contract, lease, instrument, license or other
document if (but only to the extent that) the grant of a security interest therein would (x) constitute a violation of a
valid and enforceable restriction in respect of such general intangible, investment property or other such rights in
favor of a third party or under any law, regulation, permit, order or decree of any governmental authority, unless and
until all required consents shall have been obtained or (y) expressly give any other party (other than the Company


-----

or a Restricted Subsidiary) in respect of any such contract, lease, instrument, license or other document, the right to
terminate its obligations thereunder, provided, however, that the limitation set forth in this clause (D) shall not
affect, limit, restrict or impair the grant by the Company or a Guarantor of a security interest pursuant to the Notes
Security Agreement in any such Collateral to the extent that an otherwise applicable prohibition or restriction on
such grant is rendered ineffective by the UCC or any other applicable law other than proceeds and receivables
thereof, the assignment of which is expressly deemed effective under the UCC or other similar applicable law
notwithstanding such prohibition; (E) any interests or property of the Company or a Guarantor to the extent and for
so long as the grant of a security interest or Lien pursuant to the Notes Collateral Documents in such Company’s or
Guarantor’s right, title or interest therein would result in adverse accounting or regulatory consequences that are not
_de minimis, as reasonably determined by the Company; (F) motor vehicles, airplanes, vessels and any other assets_
covered by or subject to a certificate of title other than to the extent a security interest therein can be perfected by the
filing of a UCC financing statement; (G) any assets or property of the Company or a Guarantor to the extent and for
so long as the grant of a security interest or Lien pursuant to the Notes Collateral Documents in such Company’s or
Guarantor’s right, title or interest therein is prohibited or restricted by applicable requirements of law (including any
requirement to obtain the consent or approval of any governmental authority or third Person other than the Company
or a Guarantor or any of their respective subsidiaries, unless such consent has been obtained), or by any contract
binding on such assets or property at the time of its acquisition (or on the Issue Date) and not entered into in
contemplation thereof (or in contemplation of the Transactions, as applicable); provided that the foregoing
exclusions in this clause (G) shall in no way be construed to apply to the extent that the prohibition is unenforceable
under the UCC (or any successor provision or provisions) of any relevant jurisdiction or any other applicable law;
(H) any other asset or property with respect to which the First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent and the
Company reasonably agree that the costs, burden or consequence of obtaining a security interest or perfection
thereof (including any material adverse tax consequences) are excessive in relation to the value to the First Lien
Credit Agreement Secured Parties of the security to be afford thereby (including, without limitation, the cost of title
insurance, surveys or flood insurance (if necessary) and any accounting or regulatory consequences); provided that
such assets do not secure (or purport to secure) any First Lien Obligations or Junior Lien Obligations; (I) deposit
accounts and securities accounts and any cash and cash equivalents (including securities entitlements and related
assets) held therein of the Company or any Guarantor, other than in each case, to the extent constituting or
containing proceeds of other Collateral; (J) any deposit accounts or securities accounts that are used exclusively (i)
for funding payroll, healthcare and other employee wage and benefits, (ii) any escrow account, defeasance account,
redemption account, trust account, any other account held in a fiduciary capacity, in each case for the benefit of a
third party or (iii) as an account with respect to taxes of third parties (including any sales or VAT tax) and, in each
case of clauses (i) through (iii), any cash and cash equivalents (including securities entitlements and related assets)
held therein of the Company or any Guarantor; (K) assets of the Company and the Guarantors not located in the
United States that require action under the law of any jurisdiction not located in the United States to create or perfect
a security interest or Lien on such assets, which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include intellectual property
registered, located or titled outside of the United States, except in the case of the assets of or Equity Interests in a
Foreign Subsidiary that is a Guarantor to the extent provided for in the Notes Collateral Documents or in the
Secured Indenture; (L) any assets to the extent a security interest in or Lien on such assets would result in material
adverse tax consequences to Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries and/or Parent Entity and other direct or
indirect Parent Entities, as reasonably determined by the Company; (M) all commercial tort claims reasonably
expected to result in a recovery of less than $20,000,000 individually; (N) all letters of credit and letter-of-credit
rights (whether or not the applicable letter of credit is evidenced by a writing) other than to the extent such letter of
credit or letter-of-credit right can be perfected by the filing of a UCC financing statement; (O) any leasehold interest
in any asset, to the extent a security interest therein cannot be perfected by filing a UCC financing statement; (P) any
Excluded Equity Interests; (Q) margin stock; (R) any intent-to-use trademark application (but only until the filing
and acceptance of a “Statement of Use” or “Amendment to Allege Use” with respect thereto by the United States
Patent and Trademark Office); and (S) intercompany amounts payable from a Subsidiary that is a CFC to the
Company or a Guarantor; provided that in each case set forth above, such assets will immediately cease to constitute
Excluded Property when the relevant property ceases to meet this definition and, with respect to any such property, a
security interest hereunder shall attach immediately and automatically without further action.

The security interests in the Collateral securing the Secured Notes (other than the pledge of the Company’s
Capital Stock and the other Capital Stock held by the Company and each Guarantor (to the extent constituting
Collateral and actually received by the First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent on or prior to the Completion
Date after using commercial reasonable efforts to obtain such certificates) and other assets that can be perfected by


-----

filing a financing statement under the UCC) will not be required to be in place on the Completion Date and may not
be perfected on such date, but will be required to be put in place no later than 120 days after the Completion Date or
such later date as agreed to by the First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent pursuant to a corresponding
provision under the documents relating to the First Lien Credit Agreement.

In addition, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary:

(i) prior to the Discharge of the First Lien Credit Agreement Obligations the First Lien Credit
Agreement Collateral Agent may grant extensions of time (including after the expiration of any relevant period,
which may apply retroactively) for the creation and perfection of security interests in, or obtaining of title insurance,
legal opinions, surveys or other deliverables with respect to, particular assets and such extension shall automatically
apply to the equivalent provisions under the Notes Collateral Documents;

(ii) any Lien required to be granted from time to time pursuant to the Secured Indenture and/or any action
requested in connection therewith shall be subject to the exceptions and limitations set forth in the Notes Collateral
Documents;

(iii) no Guarantor nor any of their Subsidiaries shall be required, nor shall the Notes Collateral Agent be
authorized with respect to the Collateral, (a) to deliver or provide (or take any actions with respect to obtaining), any
leasehold mortgages, landlord waivers, estoppels or collateral access letters, (b) to take any actions with respect to
perfection by “control” other than with respect to Capital Stock and certain debt instruments, (c) to take any actions
with respect to any property or assets of the Guarantors under the law of any non-U.S. jurisdiction (including
intellectual property registered outside of the United States) to create or perfect a security interest in any non-U.S.
jurisdiction (and no security agreements, pledge agreements or other collateral documents governed under the laws
of any non-U.S. jurisdiction shall be required), in each case, except with respect to a Foreign Subsidiary that is a
Guarantor, (d) other than with respect to the assets of and Capital Stock in a Foreign Subsidiary that the Company
elects, in its sole discretion, to join as a Guarantor (subject to the Agreed Security Principles) to take any action with
respect to any assets of the Guarantors (including intellectual property) located or titled outside of, or governed by or
arising under the laws of a jurisdiction outside of, the United States, (e) to enter into any control agreements with
respect to any cash or cash equivalents (including any Cash Equivalents), deposit accounts, securities accounts or
commodity accounts of the Guarantors, (f) to provide any notice or obtain the consent of governmental authorities
under the Federal Assignment of Claims Act (or any state equivalent thereof), (g) to enter into any source code
escrow arrangement or register or prosecute any intellectual property, and there shall be no obligation to make any
filings or take any actions to record or to perfect the Notes Collateral Agent’s lien on or security interest in (I) any
intellectual property other than UCC filings and the filing of documents effecting the recordation of security
interests in the United States Copyright Office and United States Patent and Trademark Office (upon which filing
such security interests shall be deemed perfected) or (II) any intellectual property subsisting outside the United
States (and neither the Notes Collateral Agent nor the Trustee shall be authorized to take any action outside of the
United States to perfect any security interests), in each case, except with respect to the assets of a Foreign Subsidiary
joined as a Guarantor (subject to the Agreed Security Principles) or (h) to, in the case of each Guarantor, take any
actions, and in the case of the Notes Collateral Agent, compel any Guarantor to take any actions, to grant, create or
perfect a security interest in Excluded Property;

(iv) all agreements, instruments and documents with respect to the Collateral shall be documented under, and
governed by, New York law (and to the extent applicable, federal law governing the Collateral comprising
intellectual property); however, any mortgages will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of
the state in which the applicable Material Real Property is located, and no foreign law legal opinions shall be


-----

required with respect to the Collateral, in each case, except with respect to the assets of and Capital Stock in a
Foreign Subsidiary that is on the Completion Date or is thereafter joined as, a Guarantor;

(v) no pledge of Excluded Equity Interests shall be required;

(vi) no perfection actions by leasehold mortgages, landlord waivers or collateral access agreements shall be
required to be entered into under the laws of any jurisdiction;

(vii) in the event that the Company shall at any time desire to join a Foreign Subsidiary as a Guarantor, the
Company and the First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent shall reasonably negotiate in good faith to subject
guarantee and collateral requirements vis-à-vis any such Foreign Subsidiary that the Company elects (in its sole
discretion) to join as a Guarantor, to “agreed security principles” that are customary for the jurisdiction of
organization of such Foreign Subsidiary (the “Agreed Security Principles”), and all guarantee and collateral
requirements with respect to the First Lien Notes Obligation and the Secured Indenture shall, apply to such
Subsidiary Guarantor, be and subject in all cases to such Agreed Security Principles; and

(viii) unless otherwise elected by the Company in its sole discretion, in no event shall (A) the assets of
any Excluded U.S. Subsidiary or Foreign Subsidiary (including the Equity Interests of any Subsidiary thereof owned
directly by such Excluded U.S. Subsidiary or Foreign Subsidiary) constitute security or secure, or such assets or the
proceeds of such assets be required to be available for payment of, the Secured Notes, (B) Equity Interests of any
CFC or FSHCO, in each case, owned directly by a Guarantor, in excess of 65% of the Voting Stock and 100% of the
Equity Interests that are not Voting Stock of such CFC or FSHCO be required to be pledged to secure the Secured
Notes or (C) any Equity Interests of any Subsidiary owned directly by a Foreign Subsidiary or Excluded U.S.
Subsidiary be required to be pledged to secure the Secured Notes.

**_After-acquired Collateral_**

From and after the Completion Date, and subject to certain limitations and exceptions, if the Company,
Parent or any other Guarantor acquires any property (including Material Real Property) or rights which are of a type
constituting Collateral under any Notes Collateral Document (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any Excluded
Property or assets not required to be Collateral pursuant to the Secured Indenture or the Notes Collateral
Documents), it will be required to execute and deliver such security instruments, financing statements and
certificates, and, with respect to Material Real Property, such mortgages, financing statements, title insurance
policies, surveys, opinions and other documents, in each case, in form and substance substantially similar to the
corresponding items delivered to the First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent under the First Lien Credit
Agreement, as are required under the Secured Indenture or any Notes Collateral Document to vest in the Notes
Collateral Agent a perfected security interest (subject to Permitted Liens) in such after-acquired collateral and to
take such actions to add such after-acquired collateral to the Collateral, and thereupon all provisions of the Secured
Indenture and the Notes Collateral Documents relating to the Collateral shall be deemed to relate to such afteracquired collateral to the same extent and with the same force and effect. From and after the Completion Date, if the
Company, Parent or any other Guarantor creates any additional security interest upon any property or asset to secure
any First Lien Obligations or Junior Lien Obligations, it must concurrently grant a first priority perfected security
interest (subject to Permitted Liens) upon any such Collateral, as security for the First Lien Notes Obligations. For
the avoidance of doubt, opinions of counsel will not be required in connection with the addition of new Guarantors
or in connection with such Guarantors entering into the Notes Collateral Documents or to vest in the Notes
Collateral Agent a perfected security interest in after-acquired collateral owned by such Guarantors (in each case,
unless such opinions are delivered to the First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent pursuant to corresponding
provisions of the First Lien Credit Agreement).

**_Further assurances_**

On or following the Completion Date and subject to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, promptly upon
the reasonable request of the Notes Collateral Agent or the First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent with
respect to the corresponding requirements under the First Lien Credit Agreement, the Company, Parent and the
Guarantors shall (i) correct any material defect or error that may be discovered in the execution, acknowledgment,


-----

filing or recordation of any Notes Collateral Document or other document or instrument relating to any Collateral
and (ii) do, execute, acknowledge, deliver, record, re-record, file, re-file, register and re-register any and all such
further acts, deeds, certificates, assurances and other instruments as may be necessary, or as the Notes Collateral
Agent may reasonably request from time to time in order to carry out more effectively the purposes of the Secured
Indenture or the Notes Collateral Documents, subject to the limitations set forth above under “—Certain limitations
on the Collateral”.

**_Liens with respect to the Collateral_**

On the Completion Date, the Company, the Guarantors and the Notes Collateral Agent will enter into the
Notes Collateral Documents establishing the terms of the security interests with respect to the Collateral. These
security interests will secure the payment and performance when due of all of the First Lien Notes Obligations of
the Company, Parent and the Guarantors. By their acceptance of the Secured Notes, each Holder will be deemed to
accept the terms of, agree to be bound by and authorize and direct each of the Trustee and Notes Collateral Agent, as
applicable, to enter into and perform its respective obligations under and the applicable Notes Collateral Documents.

**_Maintenance of Collateral_**

The Notes Collateral Documents and/or the Secured Indenture, subject to certain exceptions, will provide
that the Company and the Guarantors shall maintain the Collateral in good, safe and insurable operating order,
condition and repair (ordinary wear and tear excepted) and to do all other acts as may be reasonably necessary or
appropriate to maintain and preserve the Collateral. The Notes Collateral Documents and/or the Secured Indenture
also will provide, subject to certain exceptions, that the Company and the Guarantors shall pay all real estate and
other taxes (except such as are being contested in good faith and by appropriate negotiations or proceedings), and
use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain in full force and effect all material permits and certain insurance
coverages.

**_First Lien Intercreditor Agreement_**

On the Completion Date, the Notes Collateral Agent and the First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent
will enter into a first lien intercreditor agreement (as the same may be amended from time to time, the “First Lien
_Intercreditor Agreement”) with respect to the Collateral constituting Shared Collateral, which agreement will be_
acknowledged by the Company and the Guarantors and may be amended from time to time without the consent of
the Holders to add other parties holding First Lien Obligations permitted to be incurred under the Secured Indenture,
the First Lien Credit Agreement and the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, only the Controlling Collateral Agent (or any Person
authorized by it) may act with respect to any Shared Collateral (including with respect to any intercreditor
agreement with respect to any Shared Collateral). The Controlling Collateral Agent will initially be the First Lien
Credit Agreement Collateral Agent and will remain the First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent until the
earlier of (1) the Discharge of First Lien Credit Agreement Obligations and (2) the Non-Controlling Authorized
Representative Enforcement Date (such earlier date, the “Controlling Collateral Agent Change Date”). After the
Controlling Collateral Agent Change Date, the Controlling Collateral Agent will be the Collateral Agent for the
Controlling Secured Parties (acting on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative).

The “Controlling Secured Parties” means, with respect to any Shared Collateral, (i) at any time when the
First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent is the Controlling Collateral Agent with respect to such Shared
Collateral, the First Lien Credit Agreement Secured Parties and (ii) at any other time, the Series of First Lien
Secured Parties whose Authorized Representative is the Applicable Authorized Representative for such Shared
Collateral.

The “Applicable Authorized Representative” means with respect to any Shared Collateral, (i) until the
Controlling Collateral Agent Change Date, the First Lien Credit Agreement Administrative Agent and (ii) from and
after the Controlling Collateral Agent Change Date, the entity that was, prior to such Controlling Collateral Agent
Change Date, the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative.


-----

The “Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative” means, with respect to any Shared Collateral, the
Authorized Representative of the Series of First Lien Obligations that constitutes the largest outstanding principal
amount of any then outstanding Series of First Lien Obligations (including the First Lien Credit Agreement
Obligations) with respect to such Shared Collateral, other than the Series of First Lien Obligations with respect to
which the Authorized Representative is the Applicable Authorized Representative; provided, that if there are two
outstanding Series of Additional First Lien Obligations with equal outstanding principal amounts, the Series of
Additional First Lien Obligations with the earlier maturity date shall be considered to have a larger outstanding
principal amount for purposes of this definition.

With respect to any Shared Collateral, no Non-Controlling Authorized Representative or other NonControlling Secured Party shall commence any judicial or non-judicial foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek
to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or over, attempt any action to take possession
of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise take any action to enforce its security interest in
or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of, any Shared Collateral (including with respect to
any intercreditor agreement with respect to any Shared Collateral), whether under any First Lien Document,
applicable law or otherwise.

The “Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date” means, with respect to any NonControlling Authorized Representative, the date which is 180 days (throughout which 180-day period such NonControlling Authorized Representative was the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative) after the
occurrence of both (a) an “event of default” with respect to the applicable Additional First Lien Obligations under
which such Non-Controlling Authorized Representative is the Authorized Representative) and (b) each Collateral
Agent’s and each other Authorized Representative’s receipt of written notice from such Non-Controlling Authorized
Representative certifying that (i) such Non-Controlling Authorized Representative is the Major Non-Controlling
Authorized Representative and that an “event of default” with respect to its Additional First Lien Obligations has
occurred and is continuing and (ii) the Additional First Lien Obligations of the Series with respect to which such
Non-Controlling Authorized Representative is the Authorized Representative are currently due and payable in full
(whether as a result of acceleration thereof or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of the applicable First Lien
Documents; provided, that the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date shall be stayed and
shall not occur and shall be deemed not to have occurred with respect to any Shared Collateral (A) at any time the
Applicable Authorized Representative or the Controlling Collateral Agent has commenced and is diligently pursuing
any enforcement action with respect to such Shared Collateral or any material portion thereof or (B) at any time the
Company, Parent or any other Guarantor which has granted a security interest in any such Shared Collateral is then a
debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding. If the NonControlling Authorized Representative or any other Non-Controlling Secured Party exercises any rights or remedies
with respect to the Shared Collateral in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence of this paragraph and
thereafter the Controlling Collateral Agent or any other Controlling Secured Party commences (or attempts to
commence) the exercise of any of its rights or remedies with respect to the Shared Collateral (including seeking
relief from the automatic stay or any other stay in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding), the Non-Controlling
Authorized Representative Enforcement Date shall be deemed not to have occurred and the Non-Controlling
Authorized Representative or any other Non-Controlling Secured Party shall stop exercising any such rights or
remedies with respect to the Shared Collateral. Only the Controlling Agent may act or refrain from acting with
respect to the Shared Collateral.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, any Collateral Agent, any
Authorized Representative, or any First Lien Secured Party may file a proof of claim or statement of interest with
respect to the Obligations owed to such holder; (ii) any Collateral Agent, any Authorized Representative, or any
First Lien Secured Party may (but shall not be obligated to) take any action to preserve or protect the validity and
enforceability of the Liens granted in favor of such parties, provided that no such action is, or could reasonably be
expected to be, (A) adverse, in any material respect, to the Liens granted in favor of the secured parties that are
represented by the Controlling Collateral Agent or the rights of the Controlling Collateral Agent or any the secured
parties represented thereby to exercise remedies in respect thereof or (B) otherwise inconsistent with the terms of the
First Lien Agreement; and (iii) any Collateral Agent, any Authorized Representative, or any First Lien Secured
Party may file any responsive or defensive pleadings in opposition to any motion, claim, adversary proceeding or
other pleading made by any Person objecting to or otherwise seeking the disallowance of the claims or Liens of such


-----

party, including any claims secured by the Collateral, in each case, to the extent not inconsistent with the terms of
the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens with respect to any Shared Collateral, the Controlling
Collateral Agent (acting on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative) may deal with such Shared
Collateral as if the Controlling Collateral Agent had a senior Lien on such Collateral, subject to the waterfall
provisions below. No Non-Controlling Collateral Agent or Non-Controlling Secured Party will contest, protest or
object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the Controlling Collateral Agent, the Applicable
Authorized Representative or any Controlling Secured Party or any other exercise by the Controlling Collateral
Agent, the Applicable Authorized Representative or any Controlling Secured Party of any rights and remedies
relating to the Shared Collateral, or to cause the Controlling Collateral Agent to do so. Each of the First Lien
Secured Parties also will agree that it will not (and will waive any right to) challenge, question or contest or support
any other Person in challenging, questions or contesting, in any proceeding (including any Insolvency or Liquidation
Proceeding), the validity, value or enforceability of any First Lien Obligations of any Series or any security
documents constituting First Lien Documents or the perfection, priority, validity, value, attachment or enforceability
of a Lien held by or on behalf of any of the First Lien Secured Parties in all or any part of the Collateral. No NonControlling Collateral Agent or Non-Controlling Secured Party will seek, and hereby waives any right, to have any
Shared Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition of such Collateral.

If an event of default with respect to any Series of First Lien Obligations has occurred and is continuing,
and the Controlling Collateral Agent, the Applicable Authorized Representative or any First Lien Secured Party is
taking action to enforce rights in respect of any Shared Collateral, or any distribution is made in respect of any
Shared Collateral in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding (including any adequate protection payments) of the
Company, Parent or any other Guarantor or any First Lien Secured Party receives any payment pursuant to any
intercreditor agreement (other than the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) with respect to any Shared Collateral, the
proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Shared Collateral by the Controlling Collateral
Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party on account of such enforcement of rights or remedies or distribution in
respect thereof in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding or any payment received by the Controlling Collateral
Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party pursuant to any such intercreditor agreement (other than the First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement) with respect to such Shared Collateral (subject, in the case of any such payment, proceeds,
or distribution, to the sentence immediately following) (all proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of
any Shared Collateral and all such payments, distributions, and proceeds of any such payment or distribution being
collectively referred to as “Proceeds”) shall be applied:

(i) first, to the payment in full in cash of all amounts owing to each Collateral Agent (in its capacity as
such) pursuant to the terms of any applicable First Lien Document,

(ii) second, subject to the provisions below applicable to Impairment, to the payment in full in cash of the
First Lien Obligations of each Series secured by a valid and perfected Lien on such Shared Collateral on a ratable
basis, with such Proceeds to be applied to the First Lien Obligations of a given Series in accordance with the terms
of the applicable First Lien Documents; provided, that, following the commencement of any Insolvency or
Liquidation Proceeding with respect to the Company, Parent or any other Guarantor, solely for the purpose of this
paragraph, in the event that the value of the Shared Collateral is not sufficient for the entire amount of Post-Petition
Interest on the First Lien Obligations to be allowed under Section 506(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any
other applicable provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other Bankruptcy Law in such Insolvency or Liquidation
Proceeding, the amount of First Lien Obligations of each Series of First Lien Obligations shall include only the
maximum amount of Post-Petition Interest allowable under Section 506(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any
other applicable provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other Bankruptcy Law in such Insolvency or Liquidation
Proceeding; and

(iii) third, after payment in full of all First Lien Obligations, to the Company and the Guarantors or their
successors or assigns, as their interests may appear, or to whomsoever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same,
or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct.

If, despite the provisions of above, any First Lien Secured Party shall receive any payment or other
recovery in excess of its portion of payments on account of the First Lien Obligations to which it is then entitled in


-----

accordance with the waterfall provisions above, such First Lien Secured Party shall hold such payment or recovery
in trust for the benefit of all First Lien Secured Parties for distribution in accordance with the waterfall provisions
above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Shared Collateral for which a third party (other than a
First Lien Secured Party) has a lien or security interest that is junior in priority to the security interest of any Series
of First Lien Obligations, but senior (as determined by appropriate legal proceedings in the case of any dispute) to
the security interest of any other Series of First Lien Obligations (such third party, an “Intervening Creditor”), the
value of any Shared Collateral or Proceeds allocated to such Intervening Creditor shall be deducted on a ratable
basis solely from the Shared Collateral or Proceeds to be distributed in respect of the Series of First Lien Obligations
with respect to which such Impairment exists.

The holders of First Lien Obligations of any Series (and not the First Lien Secured Parties of any other
Series) shall bear the risk of (a) any determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that (i) any of the First Lien
Obligations of such Series are unenforceable under applicable law or are subordinated to any other obligations
(other than another Series of First Lien Obligations), (ii) any of the First Lien Obligations of such Series do not have
a valid and perfected security interest in any of the Collateral securing any other Series of First Lien Obligations
and/or (iii) any intervening security interest exists securing any other obligations (other than another Series of First
Lien Obligations) on a basis ranking prior to the security interest of such Series of First Lien Obligations but junior
to the security interest of any other Series of First Lien Obligations or (b) the existence of any Collateral for any
other Series of First Lien Obligations that is not Shared Collateral for such Series (any such condition referred to in
the foregoing clauses (a) or (b) with respect to any Series of First Lien Obligations, an “Impairment” of such Series);
_provided, that the existence of a maximum claim with respect to any real property subject to a mortgage that applies_
to all First Lien Obligations shall not be deemed to be an Impairment of any Series of First Lien Obligations. In the
event of any Impairment with respect to any Series of First Lien Obligations, the results of such Impairment shall be
borne solely by the holders of such Series of First Lien Obligations, and the rights of the holders of such Series of
First Lien Obligations (including, without limitation, the right to receive distributions in respect of such Series of
First Lien Obligations pursuant to the waterfall provisions above) shall be modified to the extent necessary so that
the effects of such Impairment are borne solely by the holders of the Series of such First Lien Obligations subject to
such Impairment. Additionally, in the event the First Lien Obligations of any Series are modified pursuant to
applicable law (including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code or any other
provision of any Bankruptcy Law), any reference to such First Lien Obligations or documents governing such First
Lien Obligations shall refer to such obligations or such documents as so modified.

If any First Lien Secured Party shall obtain possession of any Shared Collateral or shall realize any
proceeds or payment in respect of any such Shared Collateral, pursuant to any First Lien Document or by the
exercise of any rights available to it under applicable law or in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding or through
any other exercise of remedies (including pursuant to any intercreditor agreement), at any time prior to the discharge
of each Series of the First Lien Obligations, then it shall hold such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust
for the other First Lien Secured Parties and promptly transfer such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment, as the
case may be, to the Controlling Collateral Agent, to be distributed in accordance with the waterfall provisions above.

If, at any time the Controlling Collateral Agent forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any
Shared Collateral resulting in a sale or disposition thereof, then (whether or not any Insolvency or Liquidation
Proceeding is pending at the time) the Liens in favor of each other Collateral Agent for the benefit of each Series of
First Lien Secured Parties upon such Shared Collateral will automatically be released and discharged as and when,
but only to the extent, such Liens of the Controlling Collateral Agent on such Shared Collateral are released and
discharged; provided, that any proceeds of any Shared Collateral realized therefrom shall be applied pursuant to the
waterfall provisions above, subject to the Liens in favor of the First Lien Secured Parties on the same rights and
priorities as set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

_Certain limitations applicable in bankruptcy proceedings_

The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding the
commencement of any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding. If the Company and/or any Guarantor shall become
subject to an Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding and shall, as debtor(s)-in-possession, move for approval of
financing (“DIP Financing”) to be provided by one or more lenders (the “DIP Lenders”) to the Company or such
Guarantor under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or any equivalent provision of any other Bankruptcy Law


-----

and/or the use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code or any equivalent provision of any other
Bankruptcy Law, each Authorized Representative (other than the Authorized Representative of any Controlling
Secured Party) will not raise, join or support any objection to any such financing or to the Liens on the Shared
Collateral securing the same (“DIP Financing Liens”) or to any use of cash collateral that constitutes Shared
Collateral, unless the Controlling Collateral Agent (in the case of any Collateral Agent other than the First Lien
Credit Agreement Collateral Agent, acting on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative) shall
then oppose or object to such DIP Financing or such DIP Financing Liens or use of cash collateral (and (i) to the
extent that such DIP Financing Liens are senior to the Liens on any such Shared Collateral for the benefit of the
Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of the First Lien
Secured Parties of the Series for which it is acting, will subordinate its Liens with respect to such Shared Collateral
on the same terms as the Liens of the Controlling Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any First Lien Secured
Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) are subordinated thereto and (ii) to the extent that such DIP Financing
Liens rank pari passu with the Liens on any such Shared Collateral granted to secure the First Lien Obligations of
the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of the First Lien
Secured Parties of the Series for which it is acting, will confirm the priorities with respect to such Shared Collateral
as set forth herein), in each case, so long as (A) the First Lien Secured Parties of each Series retain the benefit of
their Liens on all such Shared Collateral pledged to the DIP Lenders, including proceeds thereof arising after the
commencement of such proceeding, with the same priority vis-à-vis all the other First Lien Secured Parties (other
than any Liens of the First Lien Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as existed prior to the
commencement of such Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, (B) the First Lien Secured Parties of each Series are
granted Liens on any additional or replacement collateral pledged to any First Lien Secured Parties as adequate
protection or otherwise in connection with such DIP Financing or use of cash collateral (in each case, except to the
extent a Lien on additional or replacement collateral is granted to one Series in consideration of Collateral of such
Series that is not Shared Collateral for a Series that does not receive a Lien on such additional or replacement
collateral), with the same priority vis-à-vis the First Lien Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any First Lien
Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, (C) if any
amount of such DIP Financing and/or cash collateral is applied to repay any of the First Lien Obligations, such
amount is applied pursuant to the waterfall provisions above (in each case, except to the extent a payment is made to
one Series in consideration of Collateral of such Series that is not Shared Collateral for a Series that does not receive
such payment) and (D) if any First Lien Secured Parties are granted adequate protection, including in the form of
periodic payments, in connection with such DIP Financing and/or use of cash collateral, the proceeds of such
adequate protection are applied pursuant to the waterfall provisions above (in each case, except to the extent such
adequate protection is granted to one Series in consideration of Collateral of such Series that is not Shared Collateral
for a Series that does not receive such adequate protection); provided, that the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement
does not limit the right of the First Lien Secured Parties of each Series to object to the grant of a Lien to secure the
DIP Financing over any Collateral subject to Liens in favor of the First Lien Secured Parties of such Series or its
Authorized Representative that shall not constitute Shared Collateral; provided, further, that the First Lien Secured
Parties receiving adequate protection shall not (other than as a provider of DIP Financing) object to or oppose (or
support any other Person in objecting to or opposing) any other First Lien Secured Party receiving adequate
protection comparable to any adequate protection granted to such First Lien Secured Parties in connection with a
DIP Financing and/or use of cash collateral.

The First Lien Obligations of any Series may, subject to the limitations set forth in the other First Lien
Documents, be increased, extended, renewed, replaced, restated, supplemented, restructured, repaid, refunded,
refinanced or otherwise amended or modified from time to time, all without affecting the priority of claims and
application of proceeds set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement or the other provisions thereof defining
the relative rights of the First Lien Secured Parties of any Series.

**_Release or Subordination of Collateral_**

The Company and the Guarantors will be entitled to the release of property and other assets constituting
Collateral from the Lien securing the First Lien Notes Obligations under any one or more of the following
circumstances:


-----

(1) to enable the Company and/or one or more Guarantors to consummate the sale, transfer or other
disposition (including by the termination of capital leases or the repossession of the leased property in a
capital lease by the lessor, or pursuant to investments or dividends not prohibited by the covenants of the
Secured Note Documents) of such property or assets (to a Person that is not the Company or a Guarantor)
to the extent consummated in accordance with, or not prohibited by, the covenant described under “—
Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”;

(2) in the case any Collateral becomes Excluded Property;

(3) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee with respect to the Secured Notes pursuant to
the terms of the Secured Indenture, the release of the property and assets of such Guarantor;

(4) upon the achievement of Investment Grade Status; and

(5) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers” below.

The Liens on the Collateral securing the Secured Notes and the related Note Guarantees also will be
released (i) upon payment in full of the principal of, together with accrued and unpaid interest on, the Secured Notes
and all other Obligations under the Secured Indenture, the related Note Guarantees and the Notes Collateral
Documents that are due and payable at or prior to the time such principal, together with accrued and unpaid interest,
are paid, (ii) upon a legal defeasance or covenant defeasance under the Secured Indenture as described below under
“—Defeasance” or a discharge of the Secured Indenture as described under “—Satisfaction and Discharge” or (iii)
pursuant to the Notes Collateral Documents or the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement described above.

Notwithstanding clause (4) above, if, after achievement of Investment Grade Status, two of S&P, Moody’s
and Fitch withdraw Investment Grade Status or downgrade the rating assigned to the Secured Notes below an
Investment Grade Rating, all Note Guarantees, Security Documents and Liens on the Collateral securing the First
Lien Notes Obligations shall be reinstated and the Company, Parent and the Guarantors shall take all actions
reasonably necessary to provide that the First Lien Notes Obligations shall have been unconditionally guaranteed by
each Guarantor and to provide to the Notes Collateral Agent for its benefit and the benefit of the Trustee and the
Holders of the Secured Notes valid, perfected, first priority security interests (subject to Permitted Liens) in the
Collateral within 120 days after such Reversion Date or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter.

In addition, upon the request of the Company or the applicable Guarantor, the Notes Collateral Agent may
be required to subordinate its Lien over certain Collateral to certain other Permitted Liens that are permitted to have
senior priority over such Collateral, including certain cash collateral, Lien securing Purchase Money Indebtedness or
Finance Leases, in each case, pursuant to the terms of the Secured Indenture and the applicable Notes Collateral
Documents.

**_Sufficiency of Collateral_**

The fair market value of the Collateral is subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among
others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, general economic conditions, the availability of buyers and
similar factors. The amount to be received upon a sale of the Collateral would also be dependent on numerous
factors, including, but not limited to, the actual fair market value of the Collateral at such time and the timing and
the manner of the sale. By their nature, portions of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily
ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral can be sold in a short period
of time or in an orderly manner. In addition, as discussed further below, the Holders of the Secured Notes will not be
entitled to receive post-petition interest or applicable fees, costs, expenses, or charges to the extent the amount of the
obligations due under the Secured Notes exceeds the value of the Collateral (after taking into account all other firstpriority debt that is also secured by the Collateral), or any “adequate protection” on account of any undersecured
portion of the Secured Notes.


-----

**_Certain bankruptcy limitations_**

The right of the Notes Collateral Agent to foreclose upon, repossess and dispose of the Collateral upon the
occurrence of an Event of Default would be significantly impaired (or at a minimum delayed) by any applicable
Bankruptcy Law in the event that any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding were to be commenced by or against
the Company or any Guarantor prior to the Notes Collateral Agent’s having repossessed and disposed of the
Collateral (and in some cases, even after). Upon the commencement of a case for relief under the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code, a secured creditor such as the Notes Collateral Agent is prohibited from foreclosing upon or repossessing its
security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of previously repossessed security without prior
bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances or could be materially delayed).

In view of the broad equitable powers of a U.S. bankruptcy court and the lack of a precise definition of the
meaning of “adequate protection,” it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under the Secured Notes
could be made following the commencement of a bankruptcy case (or the length of the delay in making any such
payments), whether or when the Notes Collateral Agent could or would repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the
value of the Collateral at any time during a bankruptcy case or whether or to what extent Holders of the Secured
Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral (through the provision of
adequate protection or otherwise). The Bankruptcy Code permits the payment and/or accrual of post-petition
interest, expenses, costs and fees to a secured creditor during a debtor’s bankruptcy case only to the extent the value
of such creditor’s interest in the collateral is determined by the bankruptcy court to exceed the outstanding aggregate
principal amount of all of the obligations secured by the collateral.

Furthermore, in the event a domestic or foreign bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral
is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Secured Notes (after taking into account all other obligations
secured thereby on a pari passu basis), the First Lien Notes Secured Parties would hold secured claims only to the
extent of the value of the Collateral to which the Holders of the Secured Notes are entitled, and unsecured
“deficiency” claims with respect to such shortfall, which deficiency claims would not be entitled to adequate
protection during a bankruptcy case.

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth below, the Secured Notes are not redeemable at the option of the Company.

At any time prior to   , 2026, the Company may redeem the Secured Notes in whole or in part, at its
option, upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of the Secured Notes being redeemed plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. At any time and from time to time on or after    , 2026, the
Company may redeem the Secured Notes in whole or in part, at its option, upon notice as described under “—
Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal to the percentage of principal amount of the Secured Notes being
redeemed set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on such Secured Notes to, but excluding, the
applicable date of redemption, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on     of the year indicated
below:

**Year** **Percentage**

2026 ....................................................................................... %
2027 ....................................................................................... %
2028 and thereafter ................................................................ 100.000%

At any time and from time to time prior to     , 2026, the Company may redeem Secured Notes, at its
option, upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” with an amount equal to the net cash proceeds
received by the Company from any Equity Offering at a redemption price equal to % of the principal amount of
the Secured Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on such Secured Notes to, but
excluding, the redemption date, in an aggregate principal amount for all such redemptions not to exceed 40% of the
original aggregate principal amount of the Secured Notes (including any Additional Secured Notes); provided that


-----

(1) in each case the redemption takes place not later than 180 days after the closing of the related
Equity Offering, and

(2) not less than 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Secured Notes issued under the
Secured Indenture remains outstanding immediately thereafter (excluding Secured Notes held by
the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries), unless all such Secured Notes are redeemed
substantially concurrently.

At any time prior to    , 2026, the Company may redeem up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of
the Secured Notes issued under the Secured Indenture (including any Additional Secured Notes) during any twelvemonth period, upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal to 103.000% of
the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the redemption
date.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Secured Notes, including a
Change of Control Offer or Asset Disposition Offer, if Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount
of the outstanding Secured Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Secured Notes in such tender offer and
the Company, or any third party making a such tender offer in lieu of the Company, purchases all of the Secured
Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Company or such third party will have the right
upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase
date, to redeem all Secured Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a redemption price equal to the
price offered to each other Holder (excluding any early tender or incentive fee) in such tender offer plus, to the
extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the
date of such redemption. In determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of
the outstanding Secured Notes have validly tendered and not validly withdrawn such Secured Notes in a tender
offer, including a Change of Control Offer or Asset Disposition Offer, Secured Notes owned by the Company or its
Affiliates or by funds controlled or managed by any Affiliate of the Company, or any successor thereof, shall be
deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer.

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice” below.

Notice of any redemption of the Secured Notes may, at the Company’s discretion, be given prior to the
completion of a corporate transaction (including an Equity Offering, an incurrence of Indebtedness, a Change of
Control or other corporate transaction) and any redemption notice may, at the Company’s discretion, be subject to
one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of a related transaction. If such
redemption or purchase is so subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall describe
each such condition, and if applicable, shall state that, in the Company’s discretion, the redemption date may be
delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the date the notice of redemption was mailed or
delivered, including by electronic transmission) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or such redemption
or purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not
have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption date as so delayed. In addition, the Company may
provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of the Company’s obligations with
respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest
payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date will be paid to the Person in
whose name the Secured Note is registered at the close of business on such record date in accordance with the
applicable procedures of DTC, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Secured Notes will be
subject to redemption by the Company.

Unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the
Secured Notes or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.


-----

**Mandatory Redemption; No Sinking Fund**

Except as described under the caption “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,” the
Company is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect to the
Secured Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to offer to purchase Secured
Notes as described under the captions “—Change of Control” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of
Assets and Subsidiary Stock.” The Company may at any time and from time to time purchase our outstanding debt
securities or loans, including the Secured Notes, in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer
or otherwise.

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of the Secured Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee will select the Secured
Notes for redemption in compliance with the requirements of the principal securities exchange, if any, on which the
Secured Notes are listed, as certified to the Trustee by the Company, and in compliance with the requirements of
DTC, or if the Secured Notes are not so listed or such exchange prescribes no method of selection and the Secured
Notes are not held through DTC or DTC prescribes no method of selection, the Trustee will select by lot or on a pro
rata basis, subject to adjustments so that no Secured Note in an unauthorized denomination remains outstanding after
such redemption; provided, however, that no Secured Note of $2,000 in aggregate principal amount or less shall be
redeemed in part.

Notices of redemption will be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail at least 10 days but not
more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Secured Notes to be redeemed at the address of
such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC,
with a copy to the Trustee, except that redemption notices may be delivered electronically or mailed more than 60
days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Secured Notes or a
satisfaction and discharge of the Secured Indenture.

If any Secured Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Secured
Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, in which case a portion of the original
Secured Note will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Secured Note. In the
case of a global note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Secured Note to decrease the principal amount
thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption
notice (including any conditions contained therein), Secured Notes called for redemption become due on the date
fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the
redemption price, interest ceases to accrue on Secured Notes or portions of them called for redemption.

**Change of Control**

The Secured Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs, unless the Company has previously
or substantially concurrently therewith delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Secured
Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption,” the Company will make an offer to purchase all of the Secured
Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a price in cash equal to 101% of the
aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase,
subject to the right of Holders of the Secured Notes of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on
the relevant interest payment date. Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Company will deliver or
cause to be delivered notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the procedures of
DTC or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Secured Notes at the address of such
Holder appearing in the security register, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of
Control and offering to repurchase the Secured Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the
notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered,
pursuant to the procedures required by the Secured Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a
conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control as described below.


-----

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Secured Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable
securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Secured
Indenture by virtue thereof. The Company may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the
staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Secured Indenture does not contain
provisions that permit the Holders of the Secured Notes to require that the Company repurchase or redeem the
Secured Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control may constitute a default under the
First Lien Credit Agreement that permits the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder. Future
Indebtedness of the Company or its subsidiaries may contain prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a
Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise
by the Holders of their right to require the Company to repurchase the Secured Notes could cause a default under
such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the
Company. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required
repurchases.

Our ability to pay cash to the Holders of Secured Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control
may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when
necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control purchase feature of the Secured Notes may in
certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent
management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the initial purchasers of the
Secured Notes and us. We have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control after
the Issue Date, although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the future.

Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including
acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Secured
Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our
capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the
covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in the Secured Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders
of a majority in principal amount of the Secured Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such
covenants, however, the Secured Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of
the Secured Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction.

The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (i)
a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the
requirements set forth in the Secured Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and
purchases all Secured Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice
of redemption of all outstanding Secured Notes has been given pursuant to the Secured Indenture as described above
under the caption “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption
price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition
precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change
of Control.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case
law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under
applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a
Holder of Secured Notes may require the Company to make an offer to repurchase the Secured Notes as described
above.


-----

The provisions under the Secured Indenture relating to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to
repurchase the Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent
of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Secured Notes then outstanding.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants that will be contained in the Secured Indenture. For the
avoidance of doubt, the consummation of the Transactions shall not be prohibited by the covenants below under “—
Certain Covenants.”

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

Following the first day:

(a) the Secured Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status; and

(b) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Secured Indenture,

then, beginning on that day and continuing until the Reversion Date (as defined below), the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the provisions of the Secured Indenture summarized under the
following headings (collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”):

    - “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

    - “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;

    - “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”;

    - “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”;

    - “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”;

    - “—Limitation on Guarantees”; and

    - the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of “—Merger, Amalgamation and
Consolidation.”

If at any time the Secured Notes cease to have such Investment Grade Status, then the Suspended
Covenants will thereafter be reinstated as if such covenants had never been suspended (the “Reversion Date”) and be
applicable pursuant to the terms of the Secured Indenture (including in connection with performing any calculation
or assessment to determine compliance with the terms of the Secured Indenture), unless and until the Secured Notes
subsequently attain Investment Grade Status and no Default or Event of Default is in existence (in which event the
Suspended Covenants shall no longer be in effect for such time that the Secured Notes maintain an Investment
Grade Status); provided, however, that no Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind shall be deemed to exist
under the Secured Indenture, the Secured Notes or the Note Guarantees with respect to the Suspended Covenants
based on, and none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall bear any liability for, any actions taken or events
occurring during the Suspension Period (as defined below), or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any
contractual obligation arising prior to the Reversion Date (to the extent not entered into in contemplation of the
Reversion Date) that were permitted at such time, regardless of whether such actions or events would have been
permitted if the applicable Suspended Covenants remained in effect during such period. The period of time between
the date of suspension of the covenants and the Reversion Date is referred to as the “Suspension Period.” The
Company shall not be permitted to designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary during a Suspension Period unless such
designation would be permitted if the Suspension Period was not in effect.


-----

On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have
been outstanding on the Completion Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second
paragraph of “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period will not
reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under the covenant described under “—Limitation
on Restricted Payments.” On the Reversion Date, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. Any Affiliate
Transaction entered into after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension
Period (to the extent not entered into in contemplation of the Reversion Date) will be deemed to have been
outstanding on the Completion Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (6) of the second paragraph
under “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions.” Any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted
Subsidiary to take any action described in clauses (A) through (C) of the first paragraph of “—Limitation on
Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during the Suspension Period will
be deemed to have existed on the Completion Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (1) of the second
paragraph under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries.” In addition, during a
Suspension Period any future obligation to grant further Guarantees shall be suspended; provided that such
obligation to grant Guarantees shall be reinstated upon the Reversion Date. No Default or Event of Default will be
deemed to have occurred on the Reversion Date as a result of any actions taken by the Company or its Restricted
Subsidiaries during the Suspension Period.

On and after each Reversion Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries will be permitted to consummate the
transactions contemplated by any contract entered into during the Suspension Period, so long as such contract and
such consummation would have been permitted during such Suspension Period and such contract was not entered
into in contemplation of the Reversion Date.

There can be no assurance that the Secured Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Status.

The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the ratings of the Secured Notes, shall not be deemed to have any
knowledge of the ratings of the Secured Notes and shall have no duty to notify Holders if the Secured Notes achieve
Investment Grade Status or of the occurrence of a Reversion Date or to independently determine if such events have
occurred.

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness); provided, however, that the Company and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries may
Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) if on the date of such Incurrence and after giving pro forma
effect thereto (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof) either (i) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio
for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries is greater than or equal to the lesser of (A) 2.00 to 1.00 and (B) the
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio immediately prior to the incurrence of such Indebtedness or (ii) the Consolidated
Total Leverage Ratio would have been no greater than the greater of (A) 5.45 to 1.00 and (B) the Consolidated Total
Leverage Ratio immediately prior to the incurrence of such Indebtedness.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness
(collectively, “Permitted Debt”):

(1) the sum of (X) Indebtedness Incurred under any Credit Facility by the Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries (including letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances issued or created under
any Credit Facility) and Guarantees in respect of such Indebtedness, up to an aggregate principal
amount equal to the sum of (I) $2,500,000,000 plus (II) the greater of $788 million and 100.0% of
LTM EBITDA plus (III) (i) if such Indebtedness Incurred has Pari Passu Lien Priority relative to
the Secured Notes, at the time of such Incurrence, an amount equal to the maximum principal
amount of Indebtedness that the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries could Incur such that,
after giving effect to the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, the Consolidated First Lien Secured
Leverage Ratio is equal to or less than the greater of (A) 4.70 to 1.00 and (B) the Consolidated
First Lien Secured Leverage Ratio immediately prior to the Incurrence of such Indebtedness
(provided that for purposes of determining the amount that may be Incurred under this clause
(1)(X)(III)(i), all Indebtedness Incurred under this clause (1)(X)(III)(i) shall be deemed to be


-----

included in clause (x) of the definition of “Consolidated First Lien Secured Leverage Ratio”), or
(ii) if such Indebtedness Incurred has Junior Lien Priority relative to the Secured Notes, at the time
of such Incurrence, an amount equal to the maximum principal amount of Indebtedness that the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries could Incur such that, after giving effect to the Incurrence
of such Indebtedness, the Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio is equal to or less than the greater
of (A) 5.20 to 1.00 and (B) the Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio immediately prior to the
Incurrence of such Indebtedness (provided that for purposes of determining the amount that may
be Incurred under this clause (1)(X)(III)(ii), all Indebtedness Incurred under this clause
(1)(X)(III)(ii) shall be deemed to be included in clause (x) of the definition of “Consolidated
Secured Leverage Ratio”) and (Y) in the case of any refinancing of any Indebtedness permitted
under this clause or any portion thereof, the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts,
accrued and unpaid interest, premiums (including, without limitation, tender premiums) and other
costs and expenses (including, without limitation, original issue discount, upfront fees or similar
fees) Incurred in connection with such refinancing, and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect
thereof;

(2) Guarantees by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness or other obligations of
the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness or other
obligation by such Person providing the Guarantee is not prohibited by the terms of the Secured
Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Company owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a
Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided,
_however, that:_

(a) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which results in
any such Indebtedness being held by a Person other than the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary; and

(b) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person other than the Company or
a Restricted Subsidiary,

shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such Indebtedness by the Company or
such Restricted Subsidiary not permitted by this clause (3), as the case may be;

(4) Indebtedness represented by (a) the Secured Notes (other than any Additional Secured Notes)
including any Guarantee thereof, (b) any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness incurred pursuant
to clauses (1), (3) and (4)(a), outstanding on the Completion Date and any Guarantee thereof, (c)
Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in respect of any Indebtedness described in this clause (4)
(including with respect to the Secured Notes and any Guarantee thereof) or clause (2), (5) or (8) of
this paragraph or Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, and (d) Management
Advances;

(5) Indebtedness of (a) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary Incurred to finance an acquisition
or Investment or (b) Persons that are acquired by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or
merged into, amalgamated or consolidated with the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary in
accordance with the terms of the Secured Indenture (including designating an Unrestricted
Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary); provided that such Indebtedness is in an aggregate
principal amount not to exceed (i) the greater of $472,800,000 million and 60.0% of LTM
EBITDA at any time outstanding plus (ii) unlimited additional Indebtedness if, after giving pro
forma effect to the Incurrence thereof and the application of the proceeds thereof, either

(a) in the case of unsecured Indebtedness, Indebtedness not secured by Collateral and
Indebtedness secured by Liens on the Collateral on a junior basis to any then-existing
junior lien secured Indebtedness, the Company would be permitted to Incur at least $1.00
of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant,


-----

(b) (i) if such Indebtedness Incurred has Pari Passu Lien Priority relative to the Secured
Notes, at the time of such Incurrence, the Consolidated First Lien Secured Leverage
Ratio is equal to or less than the greater of (A) 4.70 to 1.00 and (B) the Consolidated First
Lien Secured Leverage Ratio immediately prior to the Incurrence of such Indebtedness
(provided that for purposes of determining the amount that may be Incurred under this
clause (5)(b)(i), all Indebtedness Incurred under this clause (5)(b)(i) shall be deemed to
be included in clause (x) of the definition of “Consolidated First Lien Secured Leverage
Ratio”), or (ii) if such Indebtedness Incurred has Junior Lien Priority relative to the
Secured Notes, at the time of such Incurrence, the Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio
is equal to or less than the greater of (A) 5.20 to 1.00 and (B) the Consolidated Secured
Leverage Ratio immediately prior to the Incurrence of such Indebtedness (provided that
for purposes of determining the amount that may be Incurred under this clause (5)(b)(ii),
all Indebtedness Incurred under this clause (5)(b)(ii) shall be deemed to be included in
clause (x) of the definition of “Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio”),

(c) in the case of unsecured Indebtedness, Indebtedness not secured by Collateral and
Indebtedness secured by Liens on the Collateral on a junior basis to any then-existing
junior lien secured Indebtedness, either the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the
Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries would not be lower or the Consolidated Total
Leverage Ratio of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries would not be higher, in
each case, than immediately prior to such Incurrence, acquisition, merger, amalgamation
or consolidation, or

(d) such Indebtedness constitutes Acquired Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness Incurred
in contemplation of the transaction pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted
Subsidiary or was otherwise acquired by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) and the
Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio is equal to or less than 4.70 to 1.00 at the time of such
incurrence; provided that the only obligors with respect to such Indebtedness shall be
those Persons who were obligors (or who would become obligors pursuant to the
definitive documentation in respect of such Indebtedness) of such Indebtedness prior to
such Incurrence, acquisition, merger, amalgamation or consolidation or as otherwise
permitted by this covenant;

(6) Hedging Obligations or other Derivative Transactions (excluding Hedging Obligations and other
Derivative Transactions entered into for speculative purposes);

(7) [reserved];

(8) Indebtedness in respect of (a) workers’ compensation claims, health, disability or other employee
benefits, property, casualty or liability insurance, self-insurance obligations, customer guarantees,
performance, indemnity, surety, judgment, bid, appeal, advance payment (including progress
premiums), customs, value added or other similar Tax or other guarantees or other similar bonds,
instruments or obligations and completion guarantees and warranties provided by the Company or
a Restricted Subsidiary or relating to liabilities, obligations or guarantees Incurred in the ordinary
course of business or consistent with past practice or industry norms; (b) the honoring by a bank or
other financial institution of a check, draft or similar instrument drawn against insufficient funds
in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice or industry norms; provided,
_however, that such Indebtedness is extinguished within five Business Days of Incurrence; (c)_
customer deposits and advance payments (including progress premiums) received in the ordinary
course of business or consistent with past practice or industry norms from customers for goods or
services purchased in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice or industry
norms; (d) letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances, discounted bills of exchange, discounting or
factoring of receivables or payables for credit management purposes, warehouse receipts,
guarantees or other similar instruments or obligations issued or entered into, or relating to
liabilities or obligations Incurred in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice


-----

or industry norms; (e) the endorsement of instruments for deposit in the ordinary course of
business; (f) Cash Management Obligations; and (g) Settlement Indebtedness;

(9) Indebtedness arising from agreements providing for guarantees, indemnification, obligations in
respect of earn-outs, deferred purchase price or other adjustments of purchase price or, in each
case, similar obligations, in each case, Incurred or assumed in connection with the acquisition or
disposition of any business or assets or Person or any Capital Stock of a Subsidiary (other than
Guarantees of Indebtedness Incurred by any Person acquiring or disposing of such business or
assets or such Subsidiary for the purpose of financing such acquisition or disposition); provided
that the maximum liability of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in respect of all such
Indebtedness in connection with a disposition shall at no time exceed the gross proceeds, including
the fair market value of non-cash proceeds (measured at the time received and without giving
effect to any subsequent changes in value), actually received by the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries in connection with such disposition;

(10) Indebtedness in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with the
principal amount of all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause and then outstanding,
will not exceed 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds received by the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries from the issuance or sale (other than to a Restricted Subsidiary) of its Capital Stock
or otherwise contributed to the equity of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries (in each
case, other than through the issuance of Disqualified Stock, Designated Preferred Stock or an
Excluded Contribution or from the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary), in each case,
subsequent to the Completion Date and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof; provided,
_however, that (i) any such Net Cash Proceeds that are so received or contributed shall not increase_
the amount available for making Restricted Payments or increase any other basket to the extent the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries Incur Indebtedness in reliance thereon and (ii) any Net
Cash Proceeds that are so received or contributed shall be excluded for purposes of Incurring
Indebtedness pursuant to this clause to the extent such Net Cash Proceeds or cash have been

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) subject to clause (3) below, in the event that all or any portion of any item of Indebtedness meets
the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second
paragraphs of this covenant, the Company, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time
to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount and type
of such Indebtedness in the first paragraph above or one of the clauses of the second paragraph of
this covenant;


-----

(2) subject to clause (3) below, additionally, all or any portion of any item of Indebtedness may later
be reclassified as having been Incurred pursuant to any type of Indebtedness described in the first
and second paragraphs of this covenant so long as such Indebtedness is permitted to be Incurred
pursuant to such provision and any related Liens are permitted to be Incurred at the time of
reclassification (it being understood that any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to one of the clauses
of the second paragraph of this covenant shall cease to be deemed incurred or outstanding for
purposes of such clause but shall be deemed incurred for the purposes of the first paragraph of this
covenant from and after the first date on which the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries could
have incurred such Indebtedness under the first paragraph of this covenant without reliance on
such clause);

(3) notwithstanding clause (1) and (2) above, all Indebtedness outstanding on the Completion Date
under the First Lien Credit Agreement shall be deemed to have been Incurred on the Completion
Date under clause (1)(X)(I) of the second paragraph of the description of this covenant and may
not be reclassified;

(4) in the case of any Refinancing Indebtedness, such Indebtedness shall not include the aggregate
amount of fees, underwriting discounts, accrued and unpaid interest, dividends, premiums
(including, without limitation, tender premiums), defeasance costs, fees and other costs and
expenses (including, without limitation, original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees)
Incurred in connection with such refinancing;

(5) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the
determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(6) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are
Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as incurred pursuant to any clause of
the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’
acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness
shall not be included;

(7) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, or
Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory
redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase
premium) or the liquidation preference thereof;

(8) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one
provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in
part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(9) for all purposes under the Secured Indenture, including for purposes of calculating the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated First Lien Secured Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated
Secured Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, as applicable, in connection
with the incurrence, issuance or assumption of any Indebtedness pursuant to the first or second
paragraph above or the incurrence or creation of any Lien pursuant to the definition of “Permitted
Liens” or otherwise, the Company may elect, at its option, to treat all or any portion of the
committed amount of any Indebtedness (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and
bankers’ acceptances thereunder) which is to be incurred (or any commitment in respect thereof)
or secured by such Lien, as the case may be (any such committed amount elected until revoked as
described below, the “Reserved Indebtedness Amount”), as being incurred as of such election date,
and, if such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated First Lien Secured Leverage Ratio,
the Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio or other
provision of the Secured Indenture, as applicable, is complied with (or satisfied) with respect
thereto on such election date, any subsequent borrowing or reborrowing thereunder (and the
issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be deemed to


-----

be permitted under this covenant or the definition of “Permitted Liens,” as applicable, whether or
not the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated First Lien Secured Leverage Ratio, the
Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio or other provision
of the Secured Indenture, as applicable, at the actual time of any subsequent borrowing or
reborrowing (or issuance or creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) is
complied with (or satisfied) for all purposes (including as to the absence of any continuing Default
or Event of Default); provided that for the purposes of subsequent calculations of the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated First Lien Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio
or the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, as applicable, the Reserved Indebtedness Amount shall be
deemed to be outstanding, whether or not such amount is actually outstanding, for so long as such
commitments are outstanding or until the Company revokes an election of a Reserved Indebtedness
Amount;

(10) notwithstanding anything in this covenant or any other covenant to the contrary, in the case of any
Indebtedness incurred to refinance Indebtedness initially incurred in reliance on a clause of the
second paragraph of this covenant measured by reference to a percentage of LTM EBITDA at the
time of Incurrence, if such refinancing would cause the percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction to
be exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of LTM EBITDA on the date of such
refinancing, such percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so
long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal
amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus accrued and unpaid interest, dividends,
premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting discounts, fees, costs and
expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) in connection with such
refinancing; and

(11) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be
equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of GAAP.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of
original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in
the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or
obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in GAAP, shall in each case be deemed to be a permitted
Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company as of such date (and, if such
Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this “—Limitation
on Indebtedness,” the Company shall be in default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of
Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall
be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in
the case of term debt, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit debt; provided, that if such Indebtedness is
Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the
applicable U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in
effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been
exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed (a) the principal amount
of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus (b) the aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid interest, dividends,
premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting discounts, fees, costs and expenses
(including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred in connection with such refinancing.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely
as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to
refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be


-----

calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness
is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

The Secured Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured
Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured or (2) senior Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other senior
Indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral or is secured by different
collateral or because it is guaranteed by different obligors.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

Investment), (b) such Parent Entity shall, promptly following the closing thereof, cause (1) all
property acquired (whether assets or Capital Stock) to be contributed to the capital of the
Company or one of its Restricted Subsidiaries or (2) the merger or amalgamation of the Person

prohibited by the covenant “—Merger and Consolidation”) to consummate such Investment, (c)

Company or a Restricted Subsidiary could have given such consideration or made such payment
in compliance with the Secured Indenture, (d) any property received by the Company shall not

paragraph, except to the extent the fair market value at the time of such receipt of such property
exceeds the Restricted Payment made pursuant to this clause and (e) such Investment shall be
deemed to be made by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to another provision
of this covenant (other than pursuant to clause (12) hereof) or pursuant to the definition of
“Permitted Investment” (other than pursuant to clause (12) thereof);

(22) investments or other Restricted Payments in an aggregate amount not to exceed an amount equal
to the sum of Total Leverage Excess Proceeds, Declined Collateral Excess Proceeds and Declined
Excess Proceeds; and

(23) any Restricted Payment made in connection with any Permitted Intercompany Activities,
Permitted Restructuring, IPO Reorganization Transactions or related transactions.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a Restricted Payment or
Investment (or portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Payments
described in clauses (1) through (23) above, or is permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant and/or
one or more of the clauses contained in the definition of “Permitted Investment,” the Company will be entitled to
divide or classify such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) on the date of its payment or later
divide, classify or reclassify in whole or in part in its sole discretion (based on circumstances existing on the date of
such division, classification or reclassification) such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) in any
manner that complies with this covenant.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of such
Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The fair market value of any cash
Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any non-cash Restricted Payment, property
or assets other than cash shall be determined conclusively by the Company acting in good faith.

In connection with any commitment, definitive agreement or similar event relating to an Investment, the
Company or applicable Restricted Subsidiary may designate such Investment as having occurred on the date of the
commitment, definitive agreement or similar event relating thereto (such date, the “Election Date”) if, after giving
pro forma effect to such Investment and all related transactions in connection therewith and any related pro forma
adjustments, the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been permitted to make such Investment
on the relevant Election Date in compliance with the Secured Indenture, and any related subsequent actual making
of such Investment will be deemed for all purposes under the Secured Indenture to have been made on such Election
Date, including for purposes of calculating any ratio, compliance with any test, usage of any baskets hereunder (if
applicable) and Consolidated EBITDA and for purposes of determining whether there exists any Default or Event of
Default (and all such calculations on and after the Election Date until the termination, expiration, passing, rescission,
retraction or rescindment of such commitment, definitive agreement or similar event shall be made on a pro forma
basis giving effect thereto and all related transactions in connection therewith).

If the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary makes a Restricted Payment which at the time of the making of
such Restricted Payment would in the good faith determination of the Company be permitted under the provisions of
the Secured Indenture, such Restricted Payment shall be deemed to have been made in compliance with the Secured


-----

Indenture notwithstanding any subsequent adjustments made in good faith to the Company’s financial statements
affecting Consolidated Net Income or Consolidated EBITDA of the Company for any period.

For the avoidance of doubt, this covenant shall not restrict the making of, or dividends or other distributions
in amounts sufficient to make, any “AHYDO catch-up payment” with respect to any Indebtedness of any Parent
Entity, the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries permitted to be incurred under the Secured Indenture.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create, Incur or suffer to exist any
Lien (except Permitted Liens) (each, a “Subject Lien”) that secures Obligations under any Indebtedness for
borrowed money on any asset or property of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, except:

(1) in the case of any asset or property that constitutes Collateral, for any Subject Lien that expressly
has Junior Lien Priority on the Collateral relative to the Secured Notes and the Note Guarantees and is subject to a
Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement; and

(2) in the case of any asset or property that does not constitute Collateral, for any Subject Lien securing
any Indebtedness if the Secured Notes (or a Note Guarantee in the case of Subject Liens on assets or property of a
Guarantor) are secured equally and ratably with (or on a senior basis to, in the case such Subject Lien secured
Subordinated Indebtedness) the Obligations so secured for so long as such Obligations are so secured.

The foregoing shall not apply to Liens securing the Secured Notes (other than any Additional Secured Notes)
and the related Note Guarantees.

Any Lien created for the benefit of the Holders of the Secured Notes pursuant to the preceding paragraph
may provide by its terms that such Lien shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon the
release and discharge of the Subject Lien that gave rise to the obligation to so secure the Secured Notes and the Note
Guarantees.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time
of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such
Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such
Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of original
issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of
original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a
result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of property securing Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or
permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any
Restricted Subsidiary to:

(A) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or pay any
Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(B) make any loans or advances to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(C) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to_
dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including the
application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary


-----

to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute such
an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility or (b) any other agreement or
instrument, in each case, in effect at or entered into on the Completion Date;

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to the Secured Indenture, the Secured Notes and the Note
Guarantees;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to applicable law, rule, regulation or order;

(4) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or relating to
any Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date on which such
Person was acquired by or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Company
or any Restricted Subsidiary, or was designated as a Restricted Subsidiary or on which such
agreement or instrument is assumed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection
with an acquisition of assets (other than Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as consideration
in, or to provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of
related transactions pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was
acquired by the Company or was merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or entered into in contemplation of or in connection with
such transaction) and outstanding on such date; provided that, for the purposes of this clause, if
another Person is the Successor Company, any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or instrument of
such Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or assumed by the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary when such Person becomes the Successor Company;

(5) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property
or asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract or agreement, or the
assignment or transfer of any lease, license or other contract or agreement;

(b) contained in mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements permitted under
the Secured Indenture or securing Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary permitted under the Secured Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or
restrictions restrict the transfer or encumbrance of the property or assets subject to such
mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements;

(c) contained in any trading, netting, operating, construction, service, supply, purchase, sale
or other agreement to which the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is a party
entered into in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice or industry
norms; provided that such agreement prohibits the encumbrance of solely the property or
assets of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary that are subject to such agreement,
the payment rights arising thereunder or the proceeds thereof and does not extend to any
other asset or property of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary or the assets or
property of another Restricted Subsidiary; or

(d) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set
forth in any reciprocal easement agreements of the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary;


-----

(6) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Finance Lease
Obligations permitted under the Secured Indenture, in each case, that impose encumbrances or
restrictions on the property so acquired;

(7) any encumbrance or restriction imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or
indirect sale or disposition to a Person of all or substantially all the Capital Stock or assets of the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (or the property or assets that are subject to such
restriction) pending the closing of such sale or disposition;

(8) customary provisions in leases, licenses, shareholder agreements, joint venture agreements and
other similar agreements, organizational documents and instruments;

(9) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law or any applicable rule,
regulation or order, or required by any regulatory authority;

(10) any encumbrance or restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers under
agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice or
industry norms;

(11) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Hedging Obligations or Derivative Transactions;

(12) other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock of Foreign Subsidiaries permitted to be
Incurred or issued subsequent to the Completion Date pursuant to the provisions of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” that impose restrictions solely on the Foreign
Subsidiaries party thereto or their Subsidiaries;

(13) restrictions created in connection with any Qualified Securitization Financing or Receivables
Facility that, in the good faith determination of the Company, are necessary or advisable to effect
such Securitization Facility or Receivables Facility;

(14) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument relating to any
Indebtedness permitted to be incurred subsequent to the Completion Date pursuant to the
provisions of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” if the encumbrances
and restrictions contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially
less favorable to the Holders than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the First Lien
Credit Agreement, together with the security documents associated therewith, or the Secured
Indenture as in effect on the Completion Date or (ii) in comparable financings (as determined in
good faith by the Company) and where, in the case of clause (ii), either (a) the Company
determines at the time of entry into such agreement or instrument that such encumbrances or
restrictions will not adversely affect, in any material respect, the Company’s ability to make
principal or interest payments on the Secured Notes or (b) such encumbrance or restriction applies
only during the continuance of a default in respect of a payment relating to such agreement or
instrument;

(15) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any lien permitted under “—Limitation on
Liens”; or

(16) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument effecting a refinancing of
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or instrument
referred to in clauses (1) to (15) of this paragraph or this clause (an “Initial Agreement”) or
contained in any amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in
clauses (1) to (15) of this paragraph or this clause (16); provided, however, that the encumbrances
and restrictions with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or
instrument are no less favorable in any material respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the
encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which


-----

such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as determined in good
faith by the Company).

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset
Disposition unless:

(1) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including
by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities,
contingent or otherwise) at least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value to be
determined on the date of contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition), as determined in good
faith by the Company, of the shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, if such Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap);

(2) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions (except to the extent the
Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap), at least 75% of the consideration from such Asset
Disposition, together with all other Asset Dispositions since the Completion Date (on a cumulative
basis) (including by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any
liabilities, contingent or otherwise), received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the
case may be, is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents; and

(3) within 24 months from the later of (A) the date of such Asset Disposition and (B) the receipt of the
Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition (as may be extended by an Acceptable
Commitment or a Second Commitment as set forth below, the “Proceeds Application Period”), an
amount equal to the Applicable Percentage of such Net Available Cash (the “Applicable
_Proceeds”) is applied:_

(a)(I) to the extent such Net Available Cash is from an Asset Disposition of Collateral and the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, elects (or is required by the
terms of any Indebtedness), (i) to prepay, repay or purchase any Indebtedness of a NonGuarantor Subsidiary (in each case, other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary) and, in the case of revolving obligations, to correspondingly
reduce commitments with respect thereto; or (ii) to prepay, repay or purchase the Secured
Notes or any First Lien Obligations, including Indebtedness under the First Lien Credit
Agreement (or any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof that are First Lien
Obligations); provided that, to the extent the Company redeems, repays or repurchases
such First Lien Obligations pursuant to this clause (ii), the Company shall equally and
ratably reduce Obligations under the Secured Notes as provided under “—Optional
Redemption,” through open-market purchases (to the extent such purchases are at or
above 100% of the principal amount thereof) or by making an offer (in accordance with
the procedures set forth below for an Asset Disposition Offer) to all Holders to purchase
their Secured Notes at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus the amount of accrued
but unpaid interest, if any, on the amount of Secured Notes that would otherwise be
prepaid; and

(II) to the extent such Net Available Cash is from an Asset Disposition of assets or property
that do not constitute Collateral, (w) to reduce, prepay, repay or purchase any
Indebtedness secured by a Lien on such asset, (x) to reduce, prepay, repay or purchase
Pari Passu Indebtedness; provided that, to the extent the Company redeems, repays or
repurchases such Pari Passu Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (x), the Company shall
equally and ratably reduce Obligations under the Secured Notes as provided under “—
Optional Redemption,” through open-market purchases (to the extent such purchases are
at or above 100% of the principal amount thereof) or by making an offer (in accordance
with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Disposition Offer) to all Holders to
purchase their Secured Notes at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus the amount of


-----

accrued but unpaid interest, if any, on the amount of Secured Notes that would otherwise
be prepaid, (y) to make an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for an
Asset Disposition Offer) to redeem Secured Notes as described under “—Optional
Redemption” or purchase Secured Notes through open-market purchases or in privately
negotiated transactions, or (z) to reduce, prepay, repay or purchase any Indebtedness of a
Non-Guarantor (in each case, other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary); and

(b) to the extent the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in or commit to
invest in Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional Assets by
a Restricted Subsidiary equal to the amount of Net Available Cash received by the
Company or another Restricted Subsidiary) within 24 months from the later of (after
giving effect to any Acceptable Commitment or Second Commitment (as defined below),
the “Application Period”) (i) the date of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the receipt of
such Net Available Cash; provided, however, that such Additional Assets shall be
pledged as Collateral (unless such Additional Assets are Excluded Property and are not
pledged to secure any other First Lien Obligations) under the Notes Collateral Documents
and in accordance with the Secured Indenture substantially simultaneously with such
investment to the extent the assets or property disposed of constituted Collateral;
_provided further that a binding agreement shall be treated as a permitted application of_
Net Available Cash from the date of such commitment with the good faith expectation
that an amount equal to Net Available Cash will be applied to satisfy such commitment
within 180 days of such commitment (an “Acceptable Commitment”) and, in the event of
any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such
amount is applied in connection therewith, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary
enters into another Acceptable Commitment (a “Second Commitment”) within 180 days
of such cancellation or termination; provided further that if any Second Commitment is
later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such amount is applied, then such Net
Available Cash shall constitute Collateral Excess Proceeds or Excess Proceeds, as the
case may be; or

(c) any combination of the foregoing;

_provided that (1) pending the final application of the amount of any such Applicable Proceeds pursuant to this_
covenant, the Company or the applicable Restricted Subsidiaries may apply such Applicable Proceeds temporarily to
reduce Indebtedness (including under the Credit Facilities) or otherwise apply such Applicable Proceeds in any
manner not prohibited by the Secured Indenture, and (2) the Company (or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case
may be) may elect to invest in Additional Assets prior to receiving the Applicable Proceeds attributable to any given
Asset Disposition (provided that such investment shall be made no earlier than the earliest of notice to the Trustee of
the relevant Asset Disposition, execution of a definitive agreement for the relevant Asset Disposition, and
consummation of the relevant Asset Disposition) and deem the amount so invested to be applied pursuant to and in
accordance with clause (b) above with respect to such Asset Disposition.

If, with respect to any Asset Disposition of Collateral, at the expiration of the Proceeds Application Period
with respect to such Asset Disposition, there remains Applicable Proceeds in excess of the greater of $197 million
and 25.0% of LTM EBITDA (such amount of Applicable Proceeds that are equal to the greater of $197 million and
25.0% of LTM EBITDA, “Declined Collateral Excess Proceeds,” and such amount of Applicable Proceeds that are
in excess of the greater of $197 million and 25.0% of LTM EBITDA, “Collateral Excess Proceeds”), then subject to
the limitations with respect to Foreign Dispositions set forth below, the Company shall make an offer (a “Collateral
_Asset Disposition Offer”) no later than ten Business Days after the expiration of the Proceeds Application Period to_
all Holders of Secured Notes and, if required by the terms of any First Lien Obligations, to all holders of such First
Lien Obligations, to purchase the maximum principal amount of such Secured Notes or First Lien Obligations, as
appropriate, on a pro rata basis, that may be purchased out of such Collateral Excess Proceeds, if any, at an offer
price, in the case of the Secured Notes, in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof (or in the
event such other Indebtedness was issued with original issue discount, 100% of the accreted value thereof), plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any (or such lesser price with respect to First Lien Obligations, if any, as may be


-----

provided by the terms of such other Indebtedness), to, but not including, the date fixed for the closing of such offer,
in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Secured Indenture and the agreement governing the First Lien
Obligations, as applicable, in minimum denominations of $2,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess
thereof. Notices of a Collateral Asset Disposition Offer shall be sent by first class mail or sent electronically, at least
10 days but not more than 60 days before the purchase date to each Holder of the Secured Notes at such Holder’s
registered address or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, with a copy to the Trustee.
The Company may satisfy the foregoing obligation with respect to the Applicable Proceeds by making an Collateral
Asset Disposition Offer prior to the expiration of the Proceeds Application Period (the “Collateral Advance Offer”)
with respect to all or a part of the Applicable Proceeds (the “Collateral Advance Portion”) in advance of being
required to do so by the Secured Indenture.

To the extent that the aggregate amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Secured Notes and, if
applicable, any other First Lien Obligations, as the case may be, validly tendered or otherwise surrendered in
connection with a Collateral Asset Disposition Offer made with Collateral Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of a
Collateral Advance Offer, the Collateral Advance Portion) is less than the amount offered in a Collateral Asset
Disposition Offer, the Company may include any remaining Collateral Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an
Collateral Advance Offer, the Collateral Advance Portion) in Declined Collateral Excess Proceeds, and use such
Declined Collateral Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Secured Indenture. If the
aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of the Secured Notes or, if applicable, First Lien
Obligations validly tendered pursuant to any Collateral Asset Disposition Offer exceeds the amount of Collateral
Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of a Collateral Advance Offer, the Collateral Advance Portion), the Company shall
allocate the Collateral Excess Proceeds among the Secured Notes, First Lien Obligations to be purchased on a pro
rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of tendered Secured Notes
and First Lien Obligations; provided that no Secured Notes or First Lien Obligations will be selected and purchased
in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any Collateral Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of
Applicable Proceeds and Collateral Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

If, with respect to any Asset Disposition of assets or property that do not constitute Collateral, at the
expiration of the Proceeds Application Period with respect to such Asset Disposition, there remains Applicable
Proceeds in excess of the greater of $197 million and 25.0% of LTM EBITDA (such amount of Applicable Proceeds
that are equal to the greater of $197 million and 25.0% of LTM EBITDA, “Declined Excess Proceeds,” and such
amount of Applicable Proceeds that are in excess of the greater of $197 million and 25.0% of LTM EBITDA,
“Excess Proceeds”), then subject to the limitations with respect to Foreign Dispositions set forth below, the
Company shall make an offer (an “Asset Disposition Offer”) no later than ten Business Days after the expiration of
the Proceeds Application Period to all Holders of Secured Notes and, if required by the terms of any Pari Passu
Indebtedness, to all holders of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum principal amount of such
Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness, as appropriate, on a pro rata basis, that may be purchased out of such
Excess Proceeds, if any, at an offer price, in the case of the Secured Notes, in cash in an amount equal to 100% of
the principal amount thereof (or in the event such other Indebtedness was issued with original issue discount, 100%
of the accreted value thereof), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any (or such lesser price with respect to Pari Passu
Indebtedness, if any, as may be provided by the terms of such other Indebtedness), to, but not including, the date
fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Secured Indenture and the
agreement governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, in minimum denominations of $2,000 and in
integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. Notices of an Asset Disposition Offer shall be sent by first class mail
or sent electronically, at least 10 days but not more than 60 days before the purchase date to each Holder of the
Secured Notes at such Holder’s registered address or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of
DTC, with a copy to the Trustee. The Company may satisfy the foregoing obligation with respect to the Applicable
Proceeds by making an Asset Disposition Offer prior to the expiration of the Proceeds Application Period (the
“Advance Offer”) with respect to all or a part of the Applicable Proceeds (the “Advance Portion”) in advance of
being required to do so by the Secured Indenture.

To the extent that the aggregate amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Secured Notes and, if
applicable, any other Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered or otherwise surrendered in connection with an Asset
Disposition Offer made with Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) is less than
the amount offered in an Asset Disposition Offer, the Company may include any remaining Excess Proceeds (or, in
the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) in Declined Excess Proceeds, and use such Declined Excess


-----

Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Secured Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount (or
accreted value, as applicable) of the Secured Notes or, if applicable, Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered
pursuant to any Asset Disposition Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance
Offer, the Advance Portion), the Company shall allocate the Excess Proceeds among the Secured Notes and Pari
Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount (or accreted
value, as applicable) of tendered Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness; provided that no Secured Notes or
other Pari Passu Indebtedness will be selected and purchased in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of
any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Applicable Proceeds and Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this covenant, (i) to the extent that any of or all the Net Available
Cash or Applicable Proceeds of any Asset Disposition by a Foreign Subsidiary or an Excluded U.S. Subsidiary (a
“Foreign Disposition”) is (x) prohibited or delayed by applicable local law, (y) restricted by applicable
organizational documents or any agreement or (z) subject to other onerous organizational or administrative
impediments from being repatriated to the United States, the portion of such Net Available Cash so affected will not
be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant, and such amounts may be retained by the applicable
Foreign Subsidiary or Excluded U.S. Subsidiary so long, but, for the first year, only so long, as the applicable local
law or regulation, applicable organizational documents or agreements or other impediments will not permit
repatriation to the United States (the Company hereby agreeing to use reasonable efforts (as determined in the
Company’s reasonable business judgment) to otherwise cause the applicable Foreign Subsidiary or Excluded U.S.
Subsidiary to within one year following the date on which the respective payment would otherwise have been
required, promptly take all actions reasonably required by the applicable local law or regulation, applicable
organizational documents or other impediments to permit such repatriation), and if within one year following the
date on which the respective payment would otherwise have been required such repatriation of any of such affected
Net Available Cash is permitted under the applicable local law, applicable organizational impediment or other
impediment, such repatriation will be promptly effected and such repatriated Net Available Cash will be promptly
(and in any event not later than five (5) Business Days after such repatriation could be made) applied (net of
additional Taxes payable or reserved against as a result thereof without duplication of amounts already taken into
account under the definitions of “Net Available Cash” or “Applicable Proceeds”) (whether or not such repatriation
actually occurs) in compliance with this covenant and (ii) to the extent that the Company has determined in good
faith that repatriation of, or an obligation to repatriate, any of or all the Net Available Cash of any Foreign
Disposition could reasonably have an adverse Tax consequence, which is not de minimis (which for the avoidance of
doubt, includes, but is not limited to, any prepayment whereby doing so the Company, any Restricted Subsidiary, or
any of their respective Affiliates and/or direct or indirect equity owners would incur a Tax liability, including receipt
of a Tax dividend, deemed dividend pursuant to Code Section 956 or a withholding Tax), the Net Available Cash so
affected may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary or Excluded U.S. Subsidiary and may be used to
prepay indebtedness of the Foreign Subsidiaries or Excluded U.S. Subsidiaries or invested in the business of the
Foreign Subsidiaries or Excluded U.S. Subsidiaries. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this covenant shall
require the Company to cause any amounts to be repatriated to the United States (whether or not such amounts are
used in or excluded from the determination of the amount of any mandatory prepayments hereunder). The nonapplication of any prepayment amounts as a consequence of the foregoing provisions will not, for the avoidance of
doubt, constitute a Default or an Event of Default.

For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be
cash:

(1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness or other liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of
the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company or
a Guarantor) and the release of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on
such Indebtedness or other liability in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the
Company from the transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary
into cash or Cash Equivalents, or by their terms are required to be satisfied for cash and Cash
Equivalents (to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received), in each case, within 180 days
following the closing of such Asset Disposition;


-----

(3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of
such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Company and each other Restricted Subsidiary are
released from any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset
Disposition;

(4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Company (other than Subordinated Indebtedness)
received after the Completion Date from Persons who are not the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary; and

(5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in
such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other
Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time
outstanding, not to exceed the greater of $354.6 million and 45.0% of LTM EBITDA (with the fair
market value of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time
received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value).

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Secured Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable
securities laws, rules and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the
Secured Indenture by virtue thereof.

The provisions of the Secured Indenture relative to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to
repurchase the Secured Notes as a result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the written
consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Secured Notes.

The First Lien Credit Agreement may prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to
which the Company becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Company from purchasing any Secured Notes
pursuant to this covenant. In the event the Company is prohibited from purchasing the Secured Notes, the Company
could seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase of the Secured Notes or could attempt to refinance the
borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Company does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, it
will remain prohibited from purchasing the Secured Notes. In such case, the Company’s failure to purchase tendered
Secured Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Secured Indenture.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into or conduct any
transaction (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of any service) with any
Affiliate of the Company (an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate value in excess of the greater of $157.6
million and 20.0% of LTM EBITDA, unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable
transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such transaction in arm’s
length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of $236.4
million and 30.0% of LTM EBITDA, the terms of such transaction have been approved by a majority of the
members of the Board of Directors.

Any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in clause (2) of this
paragraph if such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors, if any.


-----

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment or other transaction permitted to be made or undertaken pursuant to the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” (including Permitted Payments)
or any Permitted Investment;

(2) any issuance, transfer or sale of Capital Stock other than Disqualified Stock, options, other equityrelated interests or other securities, or other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or

or other similar agreement and other compensation arrangements, options, warrants or other rights
to purchase Capital Stock of the Company, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent Entity,
restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans, stock appreciation rights plans, participation
plans or similar employee benefits or consultants’ plans (including valuation, health, insurance,
deferred compensation, severance, retirement, savings or similar plans, programs or arrangements)
or indemnities provided on behalf of future, current or former officers, employees, directors or
consultants approved by the Board of Directors of the Company, in each case in the ordinary
course of business or consistent with past practice or industry norms;

(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;

(4) (a) any transaction between or among the Company and any Restricted Subsidiary (or entity that
becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction) or between or among Restricted
Subsidiaries and (b) any merger, amalgamation or consolidation with any Parent Entity, provided
that such Parent Entity shall have no material liabilities and no material assets other than cash,
Cash Equivalents and the Capital Stock of the Company and such merger, amalgamation or
consolidation is otherwise consummated in compliance with the Secured Indenture;

(5) the payment of compensation, fees, costs and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary
indemnities (including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension
expenses provided on behalf of, or for the benefit of, future, current or former directors, officers,
consultants or employees (or their respective Controlled Investment Affiliates or Immediate
Family Members) of the Company, any Parent Entity or any Restricted Subsidiary (whether
directly or indirectly and including through any Controlled Investment Affiliate or Immediate
Family Member of such directors, officers or employees);

(6) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
under the terms of any transaction arising out of, and any payments pursuant to or for purposes of
funding, any agreement or instrument in effect as of or on the Completion Date, as these
agreements and instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed or
refinanced from time to time in accordance with the other terms of this covenant or to the extent
not more disadvantageous to the Holders in any material respect in the reasonable determination of
the Company when taken as a whole compared to the applicable agreement as in effect on the
Completion Date;

(7) any transaction effected as part of a Qualified Securitization Financing or Receivables Facility or
any disposition or acquisition of Securitization Assets, Receivables Assets or related assets in
connection with any Qualified Securitization Financing or Receivables Facility;

(8) transactions with customers, vendors, clients, joint venture partners, suppliers, contractors,
distributors or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in each case in the ordinary course of
business or consistent with past practice or industry norms, which are fair to the Company or the
relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the reasonable determination of the Board of Directors or the
senior management of the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms taken as
a whole, that are not materially less favorable than those that could reasonably have been obtained
at such time from an unaffiliated party;


-----

(9) any transaction between or among the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary and any Person that
is an Affiliate of the Company or an Associate or similar entity solely because the Company or a
Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate
of any Permitted Holder owns an equity interest in or otherwise controls such Affiliate, Associate
or similar entity;

(10) issuances, transfers or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated

Restricted Subsidiary;

(11) (a) payments by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (or distributions or dividends by the
Company in lieu of such payments) to any Permitted Holder (whether directly or indirectly),

transaction, advisory, indemnities and other fees, costs and expenses (plus any unpaid
management, consulting, monitoring, transaction, advisory, indemnities and other fees, costs and
expenses accrued in any prior year) and any exit and termination fees (including any such cash
lump sum or present value fee upon the consummation of a corporate event, including an initial
public offering) pursuant to any management services or similar agreements or the management

may be, between the Equity Investors or certain of the management companies associated with the
Equity Investors or their advisors or Affiliates, if applicable, with terms reasonably consistent with

obligations under the terms of, any equityholders, investor rights or similar agreement (including

the Completion Date and any similar agreement that it may enter into thereafter; provided,
_however, that the existence of, or the performance by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of_
its obligations under any future amendment to the equityholders’ agreement or under any similar
agreement entered into after the Completion Date will only be permitted under this clause to the
extent that the terms of any such amendment or new agreement are not otherwise, when taken as a
whole more disadvantageous to the Holders in any material respect in the reasonable
determination of the Company than those in effect on the Completion Date;


-----

(16) any purchase by the Company’s Affiliates of Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock of the Company
or any of their Restricted Subsidiaries the majority of which Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock is

Restricted Subsidiary to be deemed an Affiliate Transaction).

**_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

The Company may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation
would not cause an Event of Default described in clauses (1), (2) or (5) thereof. If a Restricted Subsidiary is
designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate fair market value of all outstanding Investments owned by
the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be
deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for
Restricted Payments under the covenant described above under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
Restricted Payments” or under one or more clauses of the definition of Permitted Investments, as determined by the
Company. That designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the
Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. The Company may redesignate
any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if that redesignation would not cause a Default.

Any designation of a Subsidiary of the Company as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to the
Trustee by an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complies with the preceding conditions and was
permitted by the covenant described above under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted
Payments.” If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the preceding requirements as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the Secured
Indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the
Company as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be incurred as of such date under the covenant


-----

described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Company will be in default of
such covenant.

The Company may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary of the
Company; provided that such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Company of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation
will only be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is permitted under the covenant described under the caption “—
Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness,” (including pursuant to clause 5(b) of the second paragraph thereof
treating such redesignation as an acquisition for the purpose of such clause) calculated on a pro forma basis as if
such designation had occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period; and (2) no Event of Default
would be in existence following such designation. Any such designation by the Company shall be evidenced to the
Trustee by an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complies with the preceding conditions.

**_Reports_**

Notwithstanding that the Company may not be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d)
of the Exchange Act or otherwise report on an annual and quarterly basis on forms provided for such annual and
quarterly reporting pursuant to rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, from and after the Completion Date,

otherwise required to be included on a Form 8-K regarding the occurrence of any such events if

any information that is not otherwise of the type and form currently included in the offering circular relating to the
Secured Notes. In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company will not be required to (i) comply with
Sections 302, 906 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or (ii) otherwise furnish any
information, certificates or reports required by Items 307 or 308 of Regulation S-K. To the extent any such
information is not so filed or furnished, as applicable, within the time periods specified above and such information
is subsequently filed or furnished, as applicable, the Company will be deemed to have satisfied its obligations with
respect thereto at such time and any Default with respect thereto shall be deemed to have been cured; provided that
such cure shall not otherwise affect the rights of the Holders under “—Events of Default” if Holders of at least 30%
in principal amount of the then total outstanding Secured Notes have declared the principal, premium, if any, interest
and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding Secured Notes to be due and payable immediately
and such declaration shall not have been rescinded or cancelled prior to such cure. In addition, to the extent not
satisfied by the foregoing, the Company will agree that, for so long as any Secured Notes are outstanding, it will
furnish to Holders and to securities analysts and prospective investors, upon their request, the information required
to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

Substantially concurrently with the furnishing of such information to the Trustee pursuant to the
immediately preceding paragraph, the Company shall also use its commercially reasonable efforts to post copies of
such information required by the immediately preceding paragraph on a website (which may be nonpublic, may
require a confidentiality acknowledgement and may be maintained by the Company or a third party) to which access
will be given to Holders, prospective investors in the Secured Notes (which prospective investors shall be limited to
“qualified institutional buyers” within the meaning of Rule 144A of the Securities Act or non-U.S. persons (as
defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act) that certify their status as such to the reasonable satisfaction of the
Company), and securities analysts and market making financial institutions that are, in the case of securities analysts
and market making financial institutions, reasonably satisfactory to the Company. The Company may condition the
delivery of any such reports to such Holders, prospective investors in the Secured Notes, and securities analysts and
market making financial institutions on the agreement of such Persons to (i) treat all such reports (and the
information contained therein) and information as confidential, (ii) not use such reports and the information


-----

contained therein for any purpose other than their investment or potential investment in the Secured Notes and (iii)
not publicly disclose any such reports (and the information contained therein) and information.

The Company will also hold quarterly conference calls for the Holders of Secured Notes, prospective
investors in the Secured Notes and securities analysts and market making financial institutions, to discuss financial
information for the previous quarter (it being understood that such quarterly conference call may be the same
conference call as with the Company’s (or as applicable, any of any Parent Entity’s) equity investors and analysts).
The conference call will be following the last day of each fiscal quarter of the Company and not later than 10
Business Days from the time that the Company distributes the financial information as set forth in the third
preceding paragraph. No fewer than two days prior to the conference call, the Company will issue a press release or
otherwise announce the time and date of such conference call and providing instructions for Holders, securities
analysts, bona fide prospective investors and market making financial institutions to obtain access to such call.

If the Company has designated any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries and such Unrestricted
Subsidiaries hold in the aggregate more than 5.0% of the Total Assets of the Company, then the annual and quarterly
financial information required by clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant will include a reasonably
detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, and in “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” of the financial condition and results of
operations of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of
operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Company.

The Secured Indenture will permit the Company to satisfy its obligations in this covenant with respect to
financial information relating to the Company by furnishing financial information relating to a Parent Entity;
_provided that the same is accompanied by consolidating information that explains in reasonable detail the_
differences between the information relating to such Parent Entity (and other direct or indirect Parent Entities
included in such information, if any), on the one hand, and the information relating to the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries on a standalone basis, on the other hand. For the avoidance of doubt, the consolidating
information referred to in the proviso in the preceding sentence need not be audited.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth above, if the Company or any Parent Entity of the
Company has furnished to the Holders of Secured Notes or filed with the SEC the reports described in the preceding
paragraphs with respect to the Company or any Parent Entity, the Company shall be deemed to be in compliance
with the provisions of this covenant, provided, however, that the Trustee shall have no obligation whatsoever to
determine if such reports have been so filed.

The Trustee shall have no duty to review or analyze any reports furnished to it. Delivery of reports,
information and documents to the Trustee under the Secured Indenture is for informational purposes only and the
information and the Trustee’s receipt of such reports shall not constitute actual or constructive knowledge of the
information contained therein or determinable therefrom, including the Company’s compliance with any of its
covenants (as to which the Trustee is entitled to conclusively rely on an Officer’s Certificate).

**_Limitation on Guarantees_**

The Company will not permit any of its Wholly Owned Domestic Subsidiaries that are Restricted
Subsidiaries (and non-Wholly Owned Domestic Subsidiaries that are Restricted Subsidiaries if such non-Wholly
Owned Domestic Subsidiaries guarantee, or are a co-obligor of, any Credit Facility or other capital markets debt of
the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary) other than a Guarantor, to Guarantee the payment of or be a borrower or
### issuer under (i) any Credit Facility or (ii) capital markets debt of the Company or any Guarantor, in the case of clause (i) or (ii), in a principal amount in excess of the greater of $394 million and 50.0% of LTM EBITDA, unless:

(1) such Restricted Subsidiary within 60 days executes and delivers a supplemental indenture to the
Secured Indenture providing for a Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary and joinders to the
applicable Notes Collateral Documents or new Notes Collateral Documents and takes all actions
required thereunder to perfect the Liens created thereunder in accordance with (and subject to the
limitations set forth under the provisions described under “Security for the Secured Notes —


-----

After-acquired Collateral,” except that with respect to a guarantee of Indebtedness of the Company
or any Guarantor, if such Indebtedness is by its express terms subordinated in right of payment to
the Secured Notes or such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee, any such guarantee by such Restricted
Subsidiary with respect to such Indebtedness shall be subordinated in right of payment to such
Guarantee substantially to the same extent as such Indebtedness is subordinated to the Secured
Notes or such Guarantor’s Guarantee of the Secured Notes; and

(2) such Restricted Subsidiary waives and will not in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit
or advantage of, any rights of reimbursement, indemnity or subrogation or any other rights against
the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary as a result of any payment by such Restricted
Subsidiary under its Guarantee until payment in full of Obligations under the Secured Indenture.

_provided that (x) this covenant shall not be applicable (i) to any guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary that existed_
at the time such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary and was not incurred in connection with, or in contemplation
of, such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary, or (ii) in the event that the Guarantee of the Company’s
obligations under the Secured Notes or the Secured Indenture by such Subsidiary would not be permitted under
applicable law and (y) notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any entity that is a borrower or a guarantor
under the First Lien Credit Agreement shall be required to be a Guarantor of the Secured Notes.

The Company may elect, in its sole discretion, to cause or allow, as the case may be, any Subsidiary or any of
its Parent Entities that is not otherwise required to be a Guarantor to become a Guarantor, in which case, such
Subsidiary or Parent Entity shall comply with clauses (1) and (2) above but shall not be required to comply with the
60-day period described above and such Guarantee may be released at any time in the Company’s sole discretion so
long as any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary then outstanding could have been incurred by such Subsidiary (either
(x) when so incurred or (y) at the time of the release of such Guarantee) assuming such Subsidiary were not a
Guarantor at such time (so long as at such time no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing (or would
result therefrom) and such Subsidiary is otherwise not required to be a Guarantor (provided that, in the case of any
Foreign Subsidiary, the collateral and guarantee provisions with respect to such joined Guarantor shall be
substantially the same as those delivered pursuant to the First Lien Credit Agreement and, if the First Lien Credit
Agreement is not outstanding at such time or such Person is not joined to the First Lien Credit Facilities, such
collateral and guarantee provisions shall be in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral and Notes Collateral
Agent and that the Company has reasonably determined are customary in such foreign jurisdiction at such time of
determination as certified by the Company to the Notes Collateral Agent in an Officer’s Certificate).

If any Guarantor becomes an Immaterial Subsidiary, the Company shall have the right, by delivery of a
supplemental indenture and joinders to the applicable Notes Collateral Documents or new Notes Collateral
Documents, executed by the Company, to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, to cause such Immaterial
Subsidiary to automatically and unconditionally cease to be a Guarantor, subject to the requirement described in the
first paragraph above that such Subsidiary shall be required to become a Guarantor if it ceases to be an Immaterial
Subsidiary (except that if such Subsidiary has been properly designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary it shall not be
so required to become a Guarantor or execute a supplemental indenture or joinders to the applicable Notes Collateral
Documents or new Notes Collateral Documents); provided that such Immaterial Subsidiary shall not be permitted to
Guarantee the First Lien Credit Agreement or any other Indebtedness of the Company or the other Guarantors,
unless it again becomes a Guarantor.

**_Merger, Amalgamation and Consolidation_**

The Company

The Company will not consolidate with or merge or amalgamate with or into or convey, transfer or lease all
or substantially all its assets, in one transaction or a series of related transactions to any Person, unless:

(1) the Company is the surviving Person or the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the
“Successor Company”) will be a Person organized and existing under the laws of the United States


-----

of America, any State of the United States or the District of Columbia and the Successor Company
(if not the Company) will expressly assume, by supplemental indenture and joinders to the
applicable Notes Collateral Documents or new Notes Collateral Documents, executed and
delivered to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, all the obligations of the Company under
the Secured Notes, the Secured Indenture and the applicable Notes Collateral Documents and if
such Successor Company is not a corporation, a co-obligor of the Secured Notes is a corporation
organized or existing under such laws;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the applicable Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the applicable Successor
Company as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the applicable Successor
Company or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), none of the Events of Default
described in clauses (1), (2) or (5) thereof shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) upon execution of an agreement to enter into such transaction, no Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, and, immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction,
either (a) the applicable Successor Company would be able to Incur at least an additional $1.00 of
Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
Indebtedness,” (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Company and the Restricted
Subsidiaries would not be lower than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction
or (c) the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries
would not be higher than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction;

(4) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent an Officer’s
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger, amalgamation
or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply with the Secured Indenture and an
Opinion of Counsel stating that such supplemental indenture (if any) has been duly authorized,
executed and delivered and is a legal, valid and binding agreement enforceable against the
Successor Company, provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an
Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact, including as to satisfaction of clauses (2) and (3)
above; and

(5) to the extent any assets of the Person which is merged or consolidated with or into the Company
are assets of the type which would constitute Collateral under the Notes Collateral Documents, the
Company or the Successor Company, as applicable, will take such action, if any, as may be
reasonably necessary to cause such property and assets to be made subject to the Lien of the
applicable Notes Collateral Document in the manner and to the extent required in the Secured
Indenture or the applicable Notes Collateral Document and shall take all reasonably necessary
action so that such Lien is perfected to the extent required by the applicable Notes Collateral
Documents.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of,
the Company under the Note Documents, and the Company will automatically and unconditionally be released and
discharged from its obligations under the Note Documents.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, (a) the Company may consolidate or otherwise
combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to a Guarantor, (b) the Company may
consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge into an Affiliate that is (i) organized or existing under the laws of
the jurisdiction of the Company or the United States of America, any State of the United States or the District of
Columbia or (ii) incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of the Company,
reincorporating the Company in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the Company, (c) any Restricted
Subsidiary may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets
to the Company or a Guarantor, (d) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge
into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to any other Restricted Subsidiary and (e) the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries may complete any Permitted Restructuring; provided that, in each case, the resulting,


-----

surviving or transferee Person will be a Person organized or existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of the United
States of America, any State of the United States or the District of Columbia.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of this section) shall not apply to the
creation of a new Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary.

The Guarantors

Subject to certain limitations described in the Secured Indenture governing release of a Guarantee upon the
sale, disposition or transfer of a Guarantor, no Guarantor may:

(1) consolidate with or merge or amalgamate with or into any Person, or

(2) sell, convey, transfer or dispose of, all or substantially all its assets, in one transaction or a series
of related transactions, to any Person, or

(3) permit any Person to merge or amalgamate with or into such Guarantor, unless

(A) the other Person is the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or
becomes a Guarantor concurrently with the transaction; or

(B) (1) either (x) the Company or a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting,
surviving or transferee Person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Guarantor
under its Note Guarantee, the Secured Indenture and the applicable Notes Collateral
Documents; and (2) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default has
occurred and is continuing; or

(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition or transfer (including by way of
consolidation, merger or amalgamation) of the Guarantor or the conveyance, transfer,
lease, sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (in each
case other than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise not prohibited by
the Secured Indenture.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, any Guarantor may (a) consolidate or otherwise
combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to another Guarantor or the Company, (b)
consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of
changing the legal domicile of the Guarantor, reincorporating the Guarantor in another jurisdiction, or changing the
legal form of the Guarantor, (c) convert into a corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability
company or trust organized or existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of organization of such Guarantor, (d)
liquidate or dissolve or change its legal form if the Company determines in good faith that such action is in the best
interests of the Company and (e) complete any Permitted Restructuring. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this covenant, the Company may contribute Capital Stock of any or all of its Subsidiaries to any Guarantor; provided
that, in each case, the resulting, surviving or transferee Person will be a Person organized or existing under the laws
of the jurisdiction of the United States of America, any State of the United States or the District of Columbia.

In addition, notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the Company and the Restricted
Subsidiaries may consummate the Transactions, and the Transactions will be permitted without compliance with this
“Merger, Amalgamation and Consolidation” covenant.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction
would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

Any reference herein to a merger, consolidation, amalgamation, assignment, sale, disposition or transfer, or
similar term, shall be deemed to apply to a division of or by a limited liability company, limited partnership or trust,


-----

or an allocation of assets to a series of a limited liability company, limited partnership or trust (or the unwinding of
such a division or allocation), as if it were a merger, consolidation, amalgamation, assignment, sale, disposition or
transfer, or similar term, as applicable, to, of or with a separate Person. Any division of a limited liability company,
limited partnership or trust shall constitute a separate Person hereunder (and each division of any limited liability
company, limited partnership or trust that is a Subsidiary, Restricted Subsidiary, Unrestricted Subsidiary, joint
venture or any other like term shall also constitute such a Person or entity).

**Compliance Testing**

When calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the Secured Indenture or compliance with
any provision of the Secured Indenture in connection with any Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or
transactions related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence, issuance or assumption of
Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence or creation of Liens, repayments, Restricted Payments
and Asset Dispositions), in each case, at the option of the Company (the Company’s election to exercise such option,
an “LCT Election”), the date of determination for availability under any such basket or ratio and whether any such
action or transaction is permitted (or any requirement or condition therefor is complied with or satisfied (including
as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of Default)) under the Secured Indenture shall be deemed to be
the date (the “LCT Test Date”) either (a) the definitive agreement for such Limited Condition Transaction is entered
into (or, if applicable, the date of delivery of an irrevocable declaration of a Restricted Payment or similar event), or
(b) solely in connection with an acquisition to which the United Kingdom City Code on Takeovers and Mergers
applies, the date on which a “Rule 2.7 announcement” of a firm intention to make an offer (or equivalent
announcement in another jurisdiction) (an “LCT Public Offer”) in respect of a target of a Limited Condition
Transaction and, in each case, if, after giving pro forma effect to the Limited Condition Transaction and any actions
or transactions related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence, issuance or assumption of
Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence or creation of Liens, repayments, Restricted Payments
and Asset Dispositions) and any related pro forma adjustments, the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
would have been permitted to take such actions or consummate such transactions on the relevant LCT Test Date in
compliance with such ratio, test or basket (and any related requirements and conditions), such ratio, test or basket
(and any related requirements and conditions) shall be deemed to have been complied with (or satisfied) for all
purposes (in the case of Indebtedness, for example, whether such Indebtedness is committed, issued, assumed or
incurred at the LCT Test Date or at any time thereafter); provided, that (a) if financial statements for one or more
subsequent fiscal quarters shall have become available, the Company may elect, in its sole discretion, to redetermine
all such ratios, tests or baskets on the basis of such financial statements, in which case, such date of redetermination
shall thereafter be the applicable LCT Test Date for purposes of such ratios, tests or baskets, (b) except as
contemplated in the foregoing clause (a), compliance with such ratios, test or baskets (and any related requirements
and conditions) shall not be determined or tested at any time after the applicable LCT Test Date for such Limited
Condition Transaction and any actions or transaction related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the
incurrence, issuance or assumption of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence or creation of
Liens, repayments, Restricted Payments and Asset Dispositions) and (b) Ratio Interest Expense for purposes of the
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio will be calculated using an assumed interest rate as determined by the Company in
good faith and without giving effect to any “pricing flex” term that may be included in any committed financing.

For the avoidance of doubt, if the Company has made an LCT Election, (1) if any of the ratios, tests or baskets
for which compliance was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would at any time after the LCT Test Date
have been exceeded or otherwise failed to have been complied with as a result of fluctuations in any such ratio, test
or basket, including due to fluctuations in EBITDA or Total Assets of the Company or the Person subject to such
Limited Condition Transaction, such baskets, tests or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded or failed to
have been complied with as a result of such fluctuations; (2) if any related requirements and conditions (including as
to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of Default) for which compliance or satisfaction was determined
or tested as of the LCT Test Date would at any time after the LCT Test Date not have been complied with or
satisfied (including due to the occurrence or continuation of an Default or Event of Default), such requirements and
conditions will not be deemed to have been failed to be complied with or satisfied (and such Default or Event of
Default shall be deemed not to have occurred or be continuing); and (3) in calculating the availability under any
ratio, test or basket in connection with any action or transaction unrelated to such Limited Condition Transaction
following the relevant LCT Test Date and prior to the earlier of the date on which such Limited Condition
Transaction is consummated or the date that the definitive agreement or date for redemption, purchase or repayment


-----

specified in an irrevocable notice for such Limited Condition Transaction is terminated, expires or passes (or, if
applicable, the irrevocable notice is terminated, expires or passes or, as applicable, the offer in respect of an LCT
Public Offer for, such acquisition is terminated), as applicable, without consummation of such Limited Condition
Transaction, any such ratio, test or basket shall be determined or tested giving pro forma effect to such Limited
Condition Transaction.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an Event of Default under the Secured Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Secured Note when due and payable, continued for 30
days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Secured Note issued
under the Secured Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon a
Special Mandatory Redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Company or any Guarantor to comply for 60 days after written notice by the Trustee
on behalf of the Holders or by the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Secured Notes with any agreement or obligation contained in the Secured Indenture;
_provided that in the case of a failure to comply with the Secured Indenture provisions described_
under “—Certain Covenants—Reports,” such period of continuance of such default or breach shall
be 180 days after written notice described in this clause (3) has been given;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which
there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by Parent, the Company
or any Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the
latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries)
would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by Parent, the
Company or any Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together
(as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for Parent, the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary)) other than Indebtedness owed
to Parent, the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now
exists, or is created after the date hereof, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of such Indebtedness, at its stated final maturity
(after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) provided in such Indebtedness
(“payment default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its stated final maturity (the
“cross acceleration provision”);

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal
amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default of principal
at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or the maturity of
which has been so accelerated, aggregates to the greater of $236.4 million and 30.0% of LTM
EBITDA (measured at the date of such non-payment or acceleration) or more at any one time
outstanding;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of Parent, the Company or a
Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest
audited consolidated financial statements for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy provisions”);


-----

(6) failure by Parent, the Company or any Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries
that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Company and
its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary), to pay final judgments
aggregating in excess of the greater of $236.4 million and 30.0% of LTM EBITDA (measured at
the date of such judgment) other than any judgments covered by indemnities provided by, or
insurance policies issued by, reputable and creditworthy companies, which final judgments remain
unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a period of more than 60 days after such judgment becomes
final, and in the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been
commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed (the
“judgment default provision”);

(7) (1) any Guarantee of the Secured Notes by a Significant Subsidiary or by Parent ceases to be in
full force and effect, other than in accordance with the terms of the Secured Indenture, (2) Parent
or a Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary denies or disaffirms its obligations under its
Guarantee of the Secured Notes, other than in accordance with the terms thereof or upon release of
such Note Guarantee in accordance with the Secured Indenture or (3) in connection with the
bankruptcy of a Guarantor, so long as the aggregate assets of such Guarantor and any other
Guarantor whose Note Guarantee ceased or ceases to be in full force as a result of a bankruptcy
are less than the greater of $118.2 million and 15.0% of LTM EBITDA (measured at the date of
such bankruptcy);

(8) (i) the Liens created by the Notes Collateral Documents shall at any time not constitute a valid and
perfected Lien on any material portion of the Collateral intended to be covered thereby (unless
perfection is not required by the Secured Indenture or the Notes Collateral Documents) other than
(A) in accordance with the terms of the relevant Notes Collateral Document and the Secured
Indenture, (B) the satisfaction in full of all Obligations under the Secured Indenture or (C) any loss
of perfection that results from the failure of the Notes Collateral Agent or other applicable
Collateral Agent as bailee for the Notes Collateral Agent pursuant to the terms of the First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement to maintain possession of certificates delivered to it representing
securities pledged under the Security Documents and (ii) such default continues for 30 days after
receipt by the Company of written notice given by the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 30%
in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Secured Notes; or

(9) Parent, the Company or any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Guarantors
that together (as of the latest consolidated financial statements of the Company for a fiscal quarter
end provided as required under “—Reports” would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) shall
assert, in any pleading in any court of competent jurisdiction, that any security interest in any
Notes Collateral Document is invalid or unenforceable (other than by reason of the satisfaction in
full of all obligations under the Secured Indenture and discharge of the Secured Indenture, the
release of the Note Guarantee of such Guarantor in accordance with the terms of the Secured
Indenture or the release of such security interest in accordance with the terms of the Secured
Indenture and the Notes Collateral Documents).

However, a Default under clause (4) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until
the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Secured Notes notify the Company
of the Default (with a copy to the Trustee, if notice is given by the Holders) and, with respect to clause (6), the
Company does not cure such Default within the time specified in clause (6) of this paragraph after receipt of such
notice; provided that a notice of Default may not be given with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or
to Holders, more than two years prior to such notice of Default. Any notice of Default, notice of acceleration or
instruction to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, to provide a notice of Default, notice of
acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders (each a
“Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such Holder delivered to the
Company, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, that such Holder is not (or, in the case such
Holder is DTC or its nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that are not) Net
Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to the
delivery of a notice of Default shall be deemed a continuing representation until the resulting Event of Default is


-----

cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Secured Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder is
deemed, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, to covenant to provide the Company with such other
information as the Company may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such
Noteholder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a “Verification Covenant”). In
any case in which the Holder is DTC or its nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required
hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Secured Notes in lieu of DTC or its nominee and DTC
shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Position Representation and Verification Covenant in delivering its
direction to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable.

If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Secured Notes, the
Company determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant
time, in breach of its Position Representation and provides to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as
applicable, an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Company has initiated litigation in a court of competent
jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position
Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default or acceleration (or notice thereof) that resulted from
the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically
stayed and the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy
stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If,
following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Secured Notes, the Company
provides to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, an Officer’s Certificate stating that a Directing
Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically
stayed and the cure period with respect to any Default or Event of Default that resulted from the applicable
Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such
Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Holder’s participation in such
Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Holder, the percentage of Secured
Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to
validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio (other than any
indemnity such Directing Holder may have offered to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable), with
the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, acceleration voided and neither the
Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall be deemed to have received such Noteholder Direction
or any notice of such Default or Event of Default.

Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction
delivered to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, during the pendency of an Event of Default as
the result of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraphs.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to
conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction delivered to it in accordance with the Secured Indenture and shall
have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any Position Representation, enforce compliance with
any Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any Officer’s Certificate delivered to it, or otherwise make
calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative
Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise. Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent, as
applicable, shall have any liability to the Company, any Holder or any other Person in acting in good faith on a
Noteholder Direction.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above with respect to the
Company) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Company or the Holders of at least 30% in principal
amount of the outstanding Secured Notes by written notice to the Company and the Trustee may declare the
principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Secured Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a
declaration, such principal and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be due and payable immediately. In the event
of a declaration of acceleration of the Secured Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (4) under “—
Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Secured Notes shall be
automatically annulled, waived and rescinded if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of
Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the
Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, in each case, within 30 days


-----

after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and the annulment of the acceleration of the Secured Notes
would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above with respect to the Company occurs and is continuing,
the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Secured Notes will become and be immediately
due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Secured Notes under the Secured
Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of
principal or interest which may only be waived with the consent of each affected Holder) and rescind any such
acceleration with respect to such Secured Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any
judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

The Secured Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required
certificate in connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is
cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another
default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any
Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “—
Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of this
Secured Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or
such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in
the Secured Indenture. Any time period in the Secured Indenture to cure any actual or alleged Default or Event of
Default may be extended or stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction to the extent such actual or alleged Default
or Event of Default is the subject of litigation.

Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent will be under any obligation to exercise any of the rights
or powers under the Secured Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have
offered and, if requested, provided to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, indemnity or
security satisfactory to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, against any loss, liability or
expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any
remedy with respect to the Secured Indenture or the Secured Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Secured Notes have requested in
writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered in writing and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security or
indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written
request and the offer of security or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Secured Notes have not given the
Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request
within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Secured
Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy
available to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, or of exercising any trust or power conferred
on the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable. The Secured Indenture will provide that, in the event
an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and is actually known or notified in writing to a responsible
officer of the Trustee, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a
prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as
applicable, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Secured Indenture or that the


-----

Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in
personal liability (it being understood that the Trustee has no duty to determine if any directed action is prejudicial
to any Holder). Prior to taking any action under the Secured Indenture, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent,
as applicable, will be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it against all fees, losses, liabilities and expenses that
may be caused by taking or not taking such action.

The Secured Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of
such occurrence by the Company, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after
being notified by the Company. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of or interest on any
Secured Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that
withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120
days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any
Default that occurred during the previous year. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days
after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain
Defaults, their status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. Neither the
Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent will be deemed to have knowledge of any Defaults or Events of Default
unless written notice of an event, which is in fact a Default, has been delivered to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral
Agent, as applicable, at its office specified in the Secured Indenture and such notice references the Secured Notes
and the Secured Indenture and states that it is a “Notice of Default”.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Note Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified
with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Secured Notes then outstanding (including
consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such Secured Notes) and,
subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent
of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Secured Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained
in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such Secured Notes). However, an
amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any such Secured Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of such Secured Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Secured
Note (other than provisions relating to Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Secured Note (other than
provisions relating to Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Secured Note or change the time at
which any such Secured Note may be redeemed, in each case as described above under “—
Optional Redemption”;

(5) make any such Secured Note payable in currency other than that stated in such Secured Note;

(6) impair the contractual right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest on such
Holder’s Secured Notes on or after the due dates therefor or impair the right of any Holder to
institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or with respect to such Holder’s Secured
Notes (and, for the avoidance of doubt, the amendment, supplement or modification in accordance
with the terms of the Secured Indenture of the covenants described above under the captions “—
Change of Control” and “—Certain Covenants” and clauses (3), (4), (6) and (7) of “—Events of
Default” and the related definitions shall be deemed not to impair the contractual right of any
Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest on such Holder’s Secured Notes on or after
the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or with
respect to such Holder’s Note);


-----

(7) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or
interest (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Secured Notes by the Holders of at
least a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Secured Notes outstanding and a waiver of
the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);

(8) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent
described in this sentence;

(9) except as expressly not prohibited by the Secured Indenture, modify the Note Guarantees of any
Significant Subsidiary in any manner materially adverse to the Holders; or

(10) expressly subordinate in right of payment the First Lien Notes Obligations to any other
Indebtedness, except in the case of (x) any Indebtedness that is permitted by the Indenture as in
effect on the Issue Date to rank senior in payment priority to the First Lien Notes Obligations, (y)
any “debtor in-possession” facility (or similar facility under applicable law) or (z) any other
Indebtedness (including to the extent exchanged for, or utilized to refinance, the Secured Notes) so
long as each Holder was offered the opportunity to participate in such Indebtedness on a ratable
basis.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of the Holders of at least 66-2/3% in aggregate
principal amount of the Secured Notes then outstanding, no amendment or waiver may (A) make any change in any
Notes Collateral Document or the provisions in the Secured Indenture dealing with Collateral or application of trust
proceeds of the Collateral with the effect of releasing the Liens on all or substantially all of the Collateral which
secure the Obligations in respect of the Secured Notes or (B) change or alter the priority of the Liens securing the
Obligations in respect of the Secured Notes, taken as a whole, to the Holders, other than, in each case, as provided
under the terms of the Secured Indenture and the Notes Collateral Documents.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Company, the Trustee, the Notes
Collateral Agent and the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Note Documents and the
Company may direct the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent to enter into an amendment to the Note Documents
to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect, error or inconsistency, conform any provision to
this “Description of the Notes,” or reduce the minimum denomination of the Secured Notes;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Company or a
Guarantor under any Note Document or to comply with the covenant described under “—Certain
Covenants—Merger and Consolidation,”;

(3) provide for uncertificated Secured Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Secured Notes or
to alter the provisions of the Secured Indenture relating to the form of the Secured Notes
(including related definitions);

(4) add to or modify the covenants or provide for a Note Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or
surrender any right or power conferred upon the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders or that does
not adversely affect the rights of any Holder in any material respect;

(6) at the Company’s election, comply with any requirement of the SEC in connection with the
qualification of the Secured Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act, if such qualification is
required;

(7) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Company) for the issuance
of Additional Secured Notes in accordance with the terms of the Secured Indenture;


-----

(8) provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Note Guarantee in accordance with the
Covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness,” to add
Guarantees with respect to the Secured Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of the Secured
Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Guarantee
or Lien with respect to or securing the Secured Notes when such release, termination, discharge or
retaking is provided for under the Secured Indenture;

(9) evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Secured Indenture of a
successor Trustee pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the
Trustee to any Note Document;

(10) secure the Secured Notes and/or the related Note Guarantees or to add collateral thereto;

(11) add an obligor or a Guarantor under the Secured Indenture;

(12) make any amendment to the provisions of the Secured Indenture relating to the transfer and
legending of Secured Notes as not prohibited by the Secured Indenture, including, without
limitation, to facilitate the issuance and administration of Secured Notes; provided, however, that
(i) compliance with the Secured Indenture as so amended would not result in Secured Notes being
transferred in violation of the Securities Act or any other applicable securities law and (ii) such
amendment does not adversely affect the rights of Holders to transfer Secured Notes in any
material respect;

(13) comply with the rules and procedures of any applicable securities depositary;

(14) make any amendment to the provisions of the Secured Indenture, the Note Guarantees and/or the
Secured Notes to eliminate the effect of any Accounting Change or in the application thereof as
described in the last paragraph of the definition of “GAAP”;

(15) to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant any other Lien in favor of the Trustee or the Notes
Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Holders, as additional security for the payment and
performance of all or any portion of the First Lien Notes Obligations, in any property or assets,
including any which are required to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a Lien is
required to be granted to or for the benefit of the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent pursuant to
the Secured Indenture, any of the Notes Collateral Documents or otherwise;

(16) to add Additional First Lien Secured Parties to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement or, in the
case of Additional Secured Notes, any Notes Collateral Document;

(17) to enter into any intercreditor agreement having substantially similar terms with respect to the
Holders as those set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement or Junior Lien Intercreditor
Agreement, as applicable, taken as a whole, or any joinder thereto;

(18) in the case of any Notes Collateral Document, to include therein any legend required to be set
forth therein pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement or to modify any such legend as
required by the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement;

(19) to provide for the succession of any parties to any Notes Collateral Document (and other
amendments that are administrative or ministerial in nature) in connection with an amendment,
renewal, extension, substitution, refinancing, restructuring, replacement, supplementing or other
modification from time to time of the First Lien Credit Agreement or any other agreement that is
not prohibited by the Secured Indenture; or

(20) to release Collateral from the Lien securing the First Lien Notes Obligations when permitted or
required by the Secured Indenture or any Notes Collateral Document.


-----

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Secured Indenture to approve the particular form of
any proposed amendment of any Note Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the
proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Secured Indenture by any Holder of
Secured Notes given in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Secured Notes will not be rendered invalid by
such tender.

**Defeasance**

The Company at any time may terminate all obligations of the Company and the Guarantors under the Note
Documents and have liens, if any, on the Collateral securing the Secured Notes released (“legal defeasance”) and
cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain obligations, including those respecting the
defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of
the Company in connection therewith and obligations concerning issuing temporary Secured Notes, registrations of
Secured Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Secured Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for
payment and money for security payments held in trust.

The Company at any time may terminate the obligations of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries
under the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants” (other than clauses (1) and (2) of “—Certain
Covenants—Merger, Amalgamation and Consolidation”) and “—Change of Control” and the default provisions
relating to such covenants described under “—Events of Default” above, the operation of the cross-default upon a
payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to the Company and
Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment default provision and the guarantee provision described under “—Events of
Default” above and have liens, if any, on the Collateral securing the Secured Notes released (“covenant
_defeasance”)._

The Company at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior
exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the
Secured Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to the Secured Notes so long as
no Secured Notes are then outstanding. If the Company exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the
Secured Notes, payment of the Secured Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in
clause (3), (4), (5) (with respect only to Significant Subsidiaries), (6) or (7) under “—Events of Default” above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Company (i) must irrevocably deposit in trust (the
“defeasance trust”) with the Trustee cash in U.S. dollars or U.S. Government Obligations or a combination thereof
sufficient, as certified by a reputable firm of certified public accountants, for the payment of principal, premium, if
any, and interest on the Secured Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be; provided, that upon any
redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for
purposes of the Secured Indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with the Trustee equal to the Applicable
Premium calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, with any deficit as of the date of redemption (any
such amount, the “Applicable Premium Deficit”) only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the
date of redemption. Any Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the
Trustee at least two Business Days prior to the redemption date that confirms that such Applicable Premium Deficit
shall be applied toward such redemption, and (ii) must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to
the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions,
stating that beneficial owners of the Secured Notes, will not recognize income, gain or loss for
U.S. federal income Tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to
U.S. federal income Tax on the same amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as
would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal
defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel in the United States must be based on a ruling of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Service or change in applicable U.S. federal income Tax law since the Issue
Date);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Company with the intent of
defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Company; and


-----

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which Opinion of Counsel may be subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or
relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Secured Indenture will be discharged and cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of
transfer or exchange of the Secured Notes and indemnification rights of the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent,
as expressly provided for in the Secured Indenture) as to all Secured Notes and the liens, if any, on the Collateral
securing the Secured Notes will be released when (1) either (a) all the Secured Notes previously authenticated and
delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Secured Notes and certain Secured Notes for which provision
for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Company) have been delivered
to the Trustee for cancellation; or (b) all Secured Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i)
have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are
to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of
redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company; (2) the Company has deposited or
caused to be deposited with the Trustee, money in U.S. dollars or U.S. Government Obligations, or a combination
thereof, as applicable, in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Secured Notes not
previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit
(in the case of Secured Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as
the case may be; provided that upon any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable Premium, the
amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the Secured Indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited
with the Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, as calculated
by the Company or on behalf of the Company by such Person as the Company shall designate, with any Applicable
Premium Deficit only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the date of redemption, and any
Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee at least two
Business Days prior to the redemption date that confirms that such Applicable Premium Deficit shall be applied
toward such redemption; (3) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Secured
Indenture; and (4) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each
stating that all conditions precedent under the “—Satisfaction and Discharge” section of the Secured Indenture
relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Secured Indenture have been complied with; provided that any such
counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing
clauses (1), (2) and (3)).

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Company any Parent Entity or any of its
or their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Company
under the Note Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their
creation. Each Holder by accepting a Secured Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are
part of the consideration for issuance of the Secured Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities
under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee**

Citibank, N.A., acting through its Agency & Trust business will be appointed as the Trustee and the Notes
Collateral Agent under the Secured Indenture. The Secured Indenture will provide that, except during the
continuance of an Event of Default actually known or notified in writing to a responsible officer of the Trustee, the
Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in such Secured Indenture. During the existence of
an Event of Default actually known or notified in writing to a responsible officer of the Trustee, the Trustee will
exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Secured Indenture and use the same degree of care that
a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain
from taking any action enumerated in the Secured Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Secured Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a
creditor of the Company, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in


-----

respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions with
the Company and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Secured Indenture sets out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced.
Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a majority
in principal amount of then outstanding Secured Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to the
Company and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is not eliminated, (b)
fails to meet certain minimum limits regarding the aggregate of its capital and surplus or (c) becomes incapable of
acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Company may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who
has been a bona fide Holder for not less than six (6) months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and
appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment
by the successor Trustee.

The Secured Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee and the Notes
Collateral Agent for any loss, liability, Taxes and expenses incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct
on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Secured Indenture.

**Notices**

All notices to Holders of Secured Notes will be validly given if electronically delivered or mailed to them
at their respective addresses in the register of the Holders of the Secured Notes, if any, maintained by the registrar.
For so long as any Secured Notes are represented by global notes, all notices to Holders of the Secured Notes will be
delivered to DTC in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, delivery of which shall be deemed to satisfy
the requirements of this paragraph, which will give such notices to the Holders of book-entry interests.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more
than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are mailed, such
notice shall be deemed to have been given on the earlier of such publication and the fifth day after being so mailed.
Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or other
equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Person if so mailed within the time prescribed.

Failure to electronically deliver or mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not
affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is electronically delivered or mailed
in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it. Notices to the Trustee shall
be deemed given upon receipt by the Trustee.

**Governing Law**

The Secured Indenture and the Secured Notes, including any Note Guarantees and the rights and duties of
the parties thereunder, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

**Certain Definitions**

“Acquired Indebtedness” means with respect to any Person (x) Indebtedness of any other Person or any of
its Subsidiaries existing at the time such other Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary or merges or amalgamates
with or into or consolidates or otherwise combines with the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary and (y)
Indebtedness secured by a Lien encumbering any asset acquired by such Person. Acquired Indebtedness shall be
deemed to have been Incurred, with respect to clause (x) of the preceding sentence, on the date such Person becomes
a Restricted Subsidiary or on the date of the relevant merger, amalgamation, consolidation, acquisition or other
combination.


-----

“Additional Assets” means:

(1) any property or assets (other than Capital Stock) used or to be used by the Company, a Restricted
Subsidiary or otherwise useful in a Similar Business (it being understood that capital expenditures
on property or assets already used in a Similar Business or to replace any property or assets that
are the subject of such Asset Disposition shall be deemed an investment in Additional Assets);

(2) the Capital Stock of a Person that is engaged in a Similar Business and becomes a Restricted
Subsidiary as a result of the acquisition of such Capital Stock by the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary; or

(3) Capital Stock constituting a minority interest in any Person that at such time is a Restricted
Subsidiary.

“Additional First Lien Obligations” means collectively (a) the First Lien Notes Obligations and (b) any

“Additional First Lien Secured Parties” means (a) the First Lien Notes Secured Parties and (b) the holders
of any other Series of Additional First Lien Obligations and any Authorized Representative with respect thereof and
the beneficiaries of the indemnification obligations thereunder.

“Affiliate” of any specified Person means any other Person, directly or indirectly, controlling or controlled

“control” when used with respect to any Person means the power to direct the management and policies of such
Person, directly or indirectly, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise; and the
terms “controlling” and “controlled” have meanings correlative to the foregoing.

“Alternative Currency” means any currency (other than U.S. dollars) that is a lawful currency (other than
U.S. dollars) that is readily available and freely transferable and convertible into U.S. dollars (as determined in good
faith by the Company).

“Applicable Percentage” means 100%; provided that so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing or would result therefrom, the Applicable Percentage shall be (1) 50% if, on a pro forma basis
after giving effect to such Asset Disposition and the use of proceeds therefrom, including the netting of the proceeds
in calculating the Consolidated Total Indebtedness, the Consolidated First Lien Secured Leverage Ratio would be
less than or equal to 4.20 to 1.00 but greater than 3.70 to 1.00, or (2) 0.00% if, on a pro forma basis after giving
effect to such Asset Disposition and the use of proceeds therefrom, the Consolidated First Lien Secured Leverage
Ratio would be less than or equal to 3.70 to 1.00. Any Net Available Cash in respect of an Asset Disposition that
does not constitute Applicable Proceeds as a result of the application of this definition shall collectively constitute
“Total Leverage Excess Proceeds.”

“Applicable Premium” means the greater of (A) 1.0% of the principal amount of such Secured Note and
(B) on any redemption date, the excess (to the extent positive) of:

(a) the present value at such redemption date of (i) the redemption price of such Secured Note at   ,
2026 (such redemption price (expressed in percentage of principal amount) being set forth in the
table under “—Optional Redemption” (excluding accrued but unpaid interest, if any)), plus (ii) all
required interest payments due on such Secured Note to and including such date set forth in clause
(i) (excluding accrued but unpaid interest, if any), computed upon the redemption date using a
discount rate equal to the Applicable Treasury Rate at such redemption date plus 50 basis points;
over

(b) the outstanding principal amount of such Secured Note;


-----

in each case, as calculated by the Company or on behalf of the Company by such Person as the Company shall

extinguishment of Indebtedness, or such issuance or redemption of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as if the
same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event an item of Indebtedness (or any portion
thereof) is incurred or issued, any Lien is incurred or other transaction is undertaken in reliance on any ratio based
exceptions, thresholds and baskets, such ratio(s) shall be calculated with respect to such incurrence, issuance or
other transaction without giving effect to amounts being utilized under any other exceptions, thresholds or baskets
(other than ratio based baskets) on the same date. Each item of Indebtedness that is incurred or issued, each Lien
incurred and each other transaction undertaken will be deemed to have been incurred, issued or taken first, to the
extent available, pursuant to the relevant ratio based test.


-----

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event an item of Indebtedness (or any portion
thereof) is incurred or issued, any Lien is incurred or other transaction is undertaken in reliance on any ratio based
exceptions, thresholds and baskets, such ratio(s) shall be calculated without regard to the incurrence of any
Indebtedness under any revolving facility or letter of credit facility immediately prior to or in connection therewith.

The Secured Indenture shall provide that any calculation or measure that is determined with reference to
the Company’s financial statements (including Consolidated EBITDA, Ratio Interest Expense, Consolidated Net
Income, Fixed Charges, Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated First Lien Secured Leverage Ratio,
Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio and Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio) may be determined with reference to
the financial statements of a Parent Entity instead, so long as such Parent Entity does not hold any material assets
other than, directly or indirectly, the Capital Stock of the Company.

For purposes of making the computation referred to above, any Investments, acquisitions, dispositions,
mergers, amalgamations, consolidations, operational changes, business expansions and disposed or discontinued
operations that have been made by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, during the reference period or
subsequent to the reference period and on or prior to or simultaneously with the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio
Calculation Date shall be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming that all such Investments, acquisitions,
dispositions, mergers, amalgamations, consolidations, operational changes, business expansions and disposed or
discontinued operations (and the change in any associated fixed charge obligations and the change in Consolidated
EBITDA resulting therefrom) had occurred on the first day of the reference period. If since the beginning of such
period any Person that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged or amalgamated with or into the
Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries since the beginning of such period shall have made any Investment,
acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, operational change, business expansion, or disposed
or discontinued operation that would have required adjustment pursuant to this definition, then the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for such period as if such Investment, acquisition,
disposition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation or disposed operation had occurred at the beginning of the
reference period.

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to a transaction (including the
Transactions), the pro forma calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or chief accounting
officer of the Company (and may include, for the avoidance of doubt, cost savings, operating expenses reductions
and synergies resulting from such transactions which is being given pro forma effect, in each case, to the extent
permitted to be included in Consolidated EBITDA). If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being
given pro forma effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire reference period (taking into
account any Hedging Obligations applicable to such Indebtedness). Interest on a Finance Lease Obligation shall be
deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the
Company to be the rate of interest implicit in such Finance Lease Obligation in accordance with GAAP. For
purposes of making the computation referred to above, interest on any Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility
computed with a pro forma basis shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of such Indebtedness
during the reference period except as set forth in the first paragraph of this definition. Interest on Indebtedness that
may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency
interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be determined to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or if none,
then based upon such optional rate chosen as the Company may designate.

Instruments, or any successor thereto or comparable accounting principle (including pursuant to the Accounting
Standards Codification), to value any Indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary at “fair value,” as defined
therein and (b) such that the amount of any Indebtedness under GAAP with respect to Finance Lease Obligations
shall be determined in accordance with the definition of Finance Lease Obligations. At any time after the Issue Date,
the Company may elect to apply IFRS accounting principles in lieu of GAAP and, upon any such election,
references herein to GAAP shall thereafter be construed to mean IFRS (except as otherwise provided in the Secured
Indenture); provided that any such election, once made, shall be irrevocable; provided, further, that any calculation
or determination in the Secured Indenture that requires the application of GAAP for periods that include fiscal
quarters ended prior to the Company’s election to apply IFRS shall remain as previously calculated or determined in
accordance with GAAP. The Company shall give notice of any such election made in accordance with this
definition to the Trustee. For the avoidance of doubt, solely making an election (without any other action) referred to
in this definition will not be treated as an incurrence of Indebtedness.

If there occurs or has occurred a change in IFRS or GAAP, as the case may be, or if the Company
implements a change in, or there is a change resulting from the adoption or modification of, accounting principles,
policies or practices in accordance with GAAP, and such change would cause a change in the method of calculation

**BOOK ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

The Notes are being offered and sold to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in
reliance on Rule 144A (“Rule 144A Notes”). The Notes also may be offered and sold to persons other than U.S.
persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S (“Regulation S Notes”). Except as set forth below, the
Notes will be issued as global notes in registered form in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples
of $1,000 in excess thereof. Notes will be issued at the closing of this offering only against payment in immediately
available funds.

Rule 144A Notes representing the Notes initially will be represented by one or more global notes in
registered form without interest coupons (collectively, the “Rule 144A Global Notes”). Regulation S Notes
representing the Notes initially will be represented by one or more temporary global notes in registered form without
interest coupons (collectively, the “Regulation S Temporary Global Notes”).

Through and including the 40th day after the later of the commencement of this offering and the closing of
this offering (such period, the “Distribution Compliance Period”), beneficial interests in the Regulation S Temporary
Global Notes may be held only through Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of the Euroclear System
(“Euroclear”), and Clearstream Banking, S.A. (“Clearstream”) (as indirect participants in DTC), unless transferred
to a person that takes delivery through a Rule 144A Global Note in accordance with the certification requirements
described below under “Exchanges Among Global Notes.” Within a reasonable time period after the expiration of
the Distribution Compliance Period, the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes will be exchanged for one or more
permanent notes in registered, global form without interest coupons (collectively, “Regulation S Permanent Global
Notes”) upon delivery to DTC of certification of compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the notes and
pursuant to Regulation S as provided in the indenture. Regulation S Temporary Global Notes and Regulation S
Permanent Global Notes are referred to herein as “Regulation S Global Notes,” and Rule 144A Global Notes and
Regulation S Temporary Global Notes are collectively referred to herein as “Global Notes.”

Rule 144A Global Notes and Regulation S Temporary Global Notes will be deposited upon issuance with
the Trustee as custodian for DTC and registered in the name of DTC or its nominee, in each case for credit to an
account of a direct or indirect participant in DTC as described below. Beneficial interests in Rule 144A Global
Notes may not be exchanged for beneficial interests in Regulation S Global Notes at any time except in the limited
circumstances described below. See “—Exchanges Among Global Notes.” Except as set forth below, Global Notes
may be transferred, in whole and not in part, only to another nominee of DTC or to a successor of DTC or its
nominee. Beneficial interests in the Global Notes may not be exchanged for definitive notes in registered certificated
form (“Certificated Notes”) except in the limited circumstances described below. Except in the limited
circumstances described below, owners of beneficial interests in Global Notes will not be entitled to receive physical
delivery of notes in certificated form. See “—Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes.”

Rule 144A Global Notes and Regulation S Global Notes (including beneficial interests in the Notes they
represent) will be subject to certain restrictions on transfer and will bear restrictive legends as described under
“Transfer Restrictions.” In addition, transfers of beneficial interests in Global Notes will be subject to the applicable
rules and procedures of DTC and its direct or indirect participants (including, if applicable, those of Euroclear and
Clearstream), which may change from time to time.

**Depository Procedures**

The following description of the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream is provided
solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective
settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. We take no responsibility for these operations and
procedures and urge investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these matters.

DTC has advised us that it is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New
York, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal
Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a
“clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to
hold securities for its participating organizations (collectively, the “Participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and


-----

settlement of transactions in those securities between the Participants through electronic book-entry changes in
accounts of its Participants. The Participants include securities brokers and dealers (including the initial purchasers),
banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC’s system is also
available to other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a
custodial relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the “Indirect Participants”).
Persons who are not Participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through the
Participants or the Indirect Participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership interests in, each
security held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the Participants and Indirect Participants.

DTC has also advised us that, pursuant to procedures established by it:

(1) upon deposit of the Rule 144A Global Notes and the Regulation S Global Notes, DTC will credit
the accounts of Participants designated by the initial purchasers with portions of the principal
amount of the Rule 144A Global Notes and the Regulation S Global Notes; and

(2) ownership of these interests in Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership of
these interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the
Participants) or by the Participants and the Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of
beneficial interests in Global Notes).

Investors in Rule 144A Global Notes who are Participants may hold their interests therein directly through
DTC. Investors in Rule 144A Global Notes who are not Participants may hold their interests therein indirectly
through organizations (including Euroclear and Clearstream) that are Participants. Investors in Regulation S Global
Notes must initially hold their interests therein through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are participants in those
systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants. After the expiration of the Distribution
Compliance Period (but not earlier), investors may also hold interests in Regulation S Global Notes through
Participants in the DTC system other than Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests
in Regulation S Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their
respective names on the books of their respective depositories, which in turn hold such interests in customers’
securities accounts in the depositaries’ names on the books of DTC. All interests in a Global Note, including those
held through Euroclear or Clearstream, may be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC. Those interests
held through Euroclear or Clearstream may also be subject to the procedures and requirements of such systems. The
laws of some states require that certain persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own.
Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to such persons will be limited to that
extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of Participants, which in turn act on behalf of Indirect Participants, the
ability of a person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge those interests to persons that do not
participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of those interests, may be affected by the lack of
a physical certificate evidencing those interests.

Except as described below, owners of an interest in Global Notes will not have Notes registered in their
names, will not receive physical delivery of Certificated Notes and will not be considered the registered owners or
“Holders” thereof under the indenture governing the Notes for any purpose.

Payments in respect of the principal of, and interest and premium, if any, on, a Global Note registered in
the name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the registered Holder under the indenture
governing the Notes. Under the terms of the indenture, the Issuer and the Trustee will treat the persons in whose
names Notes, including Global Notes, are registered as the owners of such Notes for the purpose of receiving
payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustee or any agent of the Issuer or the
Trustee has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

(1) any aspect of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to or
payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in Global Notes or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing any of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s
records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in Global Notes; or


-----

(2) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its Participants or Indirect
Participants.

DTC has advised us that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as
the Notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the payment on
the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe it will not receive payment on that payment date. Each relevant
Participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount
of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by the Participants and the Indirect Participants
to the beneficial owners of Notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the
responsibility of the Participants or the Indirect Participants and will not be the responsibility of DTC, the Trustee or
the Issuer. Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee will be liable for any delay by DTC or any of its Participants in
identifying the beneficial owners of any Notes, and the Issuer and the Trustee may conclusively rely on and will be
protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all purposes.

Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth under “Transfer Restrictions,” transfers between the Participants
in DTC will be effected in accordance with DTC’s procedures, and will be settled in same-day funds, and transfers
between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with their respective rules and
operating procedures.

Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the Notes described herein, cross-market
transfers between the Participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand,
will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case
may be, by their respective depositary; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions
to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and
procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, as the
case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its respective
depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant
Global Note from DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds
settlement applicable to or from DTC, as applicable. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not
deliver instructions directly to the depositories for Euroclear or Clearstream.

DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a Holder of Notes only at the
direction of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and only
in respect of the portion of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes as to which that Participant or those
Participants has or have given the relevant direction. However, if there is an Event of Default under the Notes, DTC
reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for legended notes in certificated form, and to distribute those notes
to its Participants. Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to
facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among Participants, they are under no obligation to perform or
continue to perform those procedures, and may discontinue or change those procedures at any time.

Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee nor any of their respective agents will have any responsibility for the
performance by DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or their respective Participants or Indirect Participants of their
respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes**

A Global Note is exchangeable for a Certificated Note if:

    - DTC (a) notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the applicable Global
Notes or (b) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and, in each case, a
successor depositary is not appointed; or

    - there has occurred and is continuing a Default or Event of Default (as defined in the indenture) with
respect to the Notes.


-----

In addition, beneficial interests in a Global Note may be exchanged for Certificated Notes upon prior
written notice given to the Issuer and the Registrar by or on behalf of DTC in accordance with the indenture. In all
cases, Certificated Notes delivered in exchange for any Global Note or beneficial interests in Global Notes will be
registered in the names, and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of the depositary (in
accordance with its customary procedures) and will bear the applicable restrictive legend referred to in “Transfer
Restrictions,” unless that legend is not required by applicable law.

**Exchange of Certificated Notes for Global Notes**

If Certificated Notes are issued in the future, they will not be exchangeable for beneficial interests in any
Global Note unless the transferor first delivers to the Issuer and the Registrar a written certificate (in the form
provided in the indenture) to the effect that the transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions. See
“Transfer Restrictions.”

**Exchanges Among Global Notes**

Prior to the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global
Note may be exchanged for beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note only if:

    - the exchange occurs in connection with a transfer of the Notes pursuant to Rule 144A; and

    - the transferor first delivers to the Issuer and the Registrar a written certificate (in the form provided in
the indenture) to the effect that the Notes are being transferred:

        - to a person who (i) the transferor reasonably believes to be a qualified institutional buyer
within the meaning of Rule 144A and (ii) is purchasing for its own account or the account of a
qualified institutional buyer in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A; and

        - in accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states of the United States and other
jurisdictions.

Beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of an interest in the Regulation S Global Note, whether before or after the expiration of the Distribution
Compliance Period, only if the transferor first delivers to the Issuer and the Registrar a written certificate (in the
form provided in the indenture) to the effect that the transfer is being made in accordance with Rule 903 or Rule 904
of Regulation S or Rule 144 (if available) and that, if such transfer occurs prior to the expiration of the Distribution
Compliance Period, the interest transferred will be held immediately thereafter through Euroclear or Clearstream.

Transfers involving exchanges of beneficial interests between a Regulation S Global Note and a Rule 144A
Global Note will be effected in DTC by means of an instruction originated by the Participant through the DTC
Deposit/Withdraw at Custodian system. Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate adjustments
will be made to reflect the changes in the principal amounts of the Regulation S Global Note and the Rule 144A
Global Note, as applicable. Any beneficial interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who
takes delivery in the form of an interest in the other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in the
original Global Note and will become an interest in the other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be
subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial interest in the other Global Note for
so long as it remains such an interest. The policies and practices of DTC may prohibit transfers of beneficial
interests in the Regulation S Global Note prior to the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period.

**Same Day Settlement and Payment**

We will make payments in respect of Notes represented by Global Notes, including payments of principal,
premium, if any, and interest, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by DTC or
its nominee. We will make all payments of principal of and premium, if any, and interest on Certificated Notes by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the Holders of the Certificated Notes or, if


-----

no account is specified, by mailing a check to each Holder’s registered address. See “Description of the Notes—
Principal, Maturity and Interest.” Notes represented by Global Notes are expected to be eligible to trade in DTC’s
Same-Day Funds Settlement System, and any permitted secondary market trading activity in Notes represented by
Global Notes will, therefore, be required by DTC to be settled in immediately available funds. We expect that
secondary trading in any Certificated Notes will also be settled in immediately available funds. Because of time
zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant purchasing an interest in a Global
Note from a Participant will be credited, and any such crediting will be reported to the relevant Euroclear or
Clearstream participant, during the securities settlement processing day (which must be a business day for Euroclear
and Clearstream) immediately following the settlement date of DTC. DTC has advised us that cash received in
Euroclear or Clearstream as a result of sales of interests in a Global Note by or through a Euroclear or Clearstream
participant to a Participant will be received with value on the settlement date of DTC but will be available in the
relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account only as of the business day for Euroclear or Clearstream following
DTC’s settlement date.

**CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to the ownership and
disposition of the Notes by U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below). This summary is general in
nature and does not discuss all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a holder of Notes in
light of its particular circumstances. In addition, this summary does not describe any U.S. federal tax considerations
other than income tax considerations (such as estate or gift tax considerations, or the Medicare tax on net investment
income) or any state, local or non-U.S. tax considerations.

This summary is based on the provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
“Code”), the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder (“Regulations”), judicial authority, administrative
pronouncements of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other applicable authorities, all as in effect on the
date of this offering circular. Changes in such authorities or new interpretations thereof may have retroactive effect
and could significantly affect the U.S. federal income tax considerations discussed below. We have not sought any
ruling from the IRS with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary, and
there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will agree with our statements and conclusions or that a court
would not sustain any challenge by the IRS in the event of litigation.

This summary deals only with Notes that are purchased for cash in this offering at their “issue price” (the
first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold for money to investors, not including bond houses,
brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers)
and that are held as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for
investment). In addition, this summary does not address U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to
investors that may be subject to special tax rules, such as:

    - banks, insurance companies or other financial institutions;

    - persons subject to the alternative minimum tax;

    - persons subject to Section 451(b) of the Code;

    - dealers or traders in securities;

    - brokers;

    - traders that have elected mark-to-market tax accounting treatment;

    - retirement plans and other tax-deferred accounts;

    - tax-exempt entities;

    - S corporations, partnerships or other pass through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes or
investors in such entities;

    - real estate investment trusts;

    - regulated investment companies;

    - non-U.S. trusts or estates with U.S. beneficiaries;

    - U.S. persons whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;

    - investors that hold the Notes as part of a straddle, synthetic security or conversion transaction;


-----

    - controlled foreign corporations;

    - passive foreign investment companies;

    - corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax;

    - U.S. Holders who hold Notes through non-U.S. brokers or other non-U.S. intermediaries; and

    - former citizens or residents of the United States subject to Section 877 of the Code.

In the case of a holder of Notes that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the
tax treatment of the Notes to the partnership or a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the tax status
of the partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership. A partner in a partnership considering an
investment in the Notes should consult its tax advisor regarding an investment in the Notes.

The following summary is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for careful tax planning
and advice. Each investor considering an investment in the Notes should consult its tax advisor with respect to the
application of the U.S. federal income tax laws to such investor’s particular situations, as well as any tax
considerations arising under any other U.S. federal tax laws or the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing
jurisdiction or under any applicable tax treaty.

**Effect of Certain Contingencies**

We may be required to pay amounts in addition to the stated principal amount of and stated interest on the
Notes (e.g., upon a change in control as described in “Description of the Notes—Change of Control”), or we may be
required, or we may elect, to repurchase or redeem the Notes before the stated maturity date (e.g., pursuant to certain
repurchase or redemption rights, including the Special Mandatory Redemption, as described in “Description of the
Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption”). Such contingencies may implicate the provisions of
the Regulations relating to “contingent payment debt instruments.” We intend to take the position that the
contingencies associated with the Notes should not cause the Notes to be subject to the contingent payment debt
instrument rules.

Our determination that the Notes are not subject to the contingent payment debt instrument rules is binding
on a beneficial owner, unless such beneficial owner explicitly discloses to the IRS on its tax return for the year
during which it acquires the Notes that it is taking a different position. Our position is not binding, however, on the
IRS. If the IRS takes a position contrary to that described above, then the Notes may be treated as contingent
payment debt instruments and a beneficial owner subject to U.S. federal income taxation may be required to accrue
interest income on the Notes at a rate in excess of the stated interest based upon a “comparable yield.” The
“comparable yield” is the yield at which we would issue a fixed rate debt instrument with no contingent payments,
but with terms and conditions similar to those of the Notes. In addition, any gain on the sale, exchange, redemption,
retirement or other taxable disposition of the Notes would be treated as ordinary income rather than as capital gain.
Each holder of Notes should consult its tax advisor regarding the tax considerations of the Notes being treated as
contingent payment debt instruments. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Notes will not be treated as
contingent payment debt instruments.

**U.S. Holders**

The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations to a U.S. Holder of the
ownership and disposition of the Notes. For purposes of this summary, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial
owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:

    - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

    - a corporation organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of
Columbia;


-----

    - an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

    - a trust, if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary jurisdiction over its
administration and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all of its substantial
decisions, or (ii) a valid election is in place under applicable Regulations to treat such trust as a
domestic trust.

_Stated Interest_

Stated interest on a Note will be included in the gross income of a U.S. Holder as ordinary income at the
time that such interest is accrued or received, in accordance with the holder’s regular method of accounting for U.S.
federal income tax purposes.

_Sale, Exchange, Redemption, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition_

Upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder
generally will recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the amount realized upon the
disposition and (ii) the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note. The amount realized will be equal to the sum of
the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received in exchange for the Note, less any portion
allocable to any accrued and unpaid stated interest, which portion will be taxed as ordinary interest income (as
described above under “—Stated Interest”) to the extent not previously so taxed. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis
in the Note generally will equal the cost of the Note to such U.S. Holder. Any such capital gain or loss will be longterm capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder has held the Note for more than one year. In general, long-term capital
gains of individual and other noncorporate U.S. Holders are taxed at lower rates than those applicable to ordinary
income. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Each U.S. Holder should consult its tax advisor
as to the deductibility of capital losses in their particular circumstances.

_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_

In general, the applicable withholding agent must report certain information to the IRS with respect to
payments of stated interest, and payments of the proceeds of the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other
taxable disposition of the Notes, to certain U.S. Holders. The applicable withholding agent also may be required to
impose backup withholding (currently at the rate of 24%), if (i) the payee fails to furnish a taxpayer identification
number (“TIN”) to the applicable withholding agent or to otherwise establish an exemption from backup
withholding; (ii) the IRS notifies the applicable withholding agent that the TIN furnished by the payee is incorrect;
(iii) there has been a notified payee underreporting described in Section 3406(c) of the Code; or (iv) the payee has
not certified under penalties of perjury that it has furnished a correct TIN and that the IRS has not notified the payee
that it is subject to backup withholding under the Code. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts
withheld under the backup withholding rules from a payment to a U.S. Holder generally will be allowed as a credit
against that U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, and may entitle the U.S. Holder to a refund,
provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**Non-U.S. Holders**

The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations to a Non-U.S. Holder of the
ownership and disposition of the Notes. For purposes of this summary, the term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a
beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, an individual, corporation, estate or trust
that is not a U.S. Holder.

_U.S. Federal Withholding Tax_

Subject to the discussions of backup withholding and FATCA (as defined below), interest paid on a Note
to a Non-U.S. Holder will be exempt from U.S. federal withholding tax, provided that:


-----

    - interest paid on the Note is not effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or
business in the United States;

    - the Non-U.S. Holder does not, actually or constructively, own stock possessing 10% or more of the
total combined voting power of all classes of our voting stock and is not a controlled foreign
corporation related to us, actually or constructively;

    - the Non-U.S. Holder is not a bank that acquired the Notes in consideration for an extension of credit
made pursuant to a loan agreement entered into in the ordinary course of its trade or business; and

    - either (a) the Non-U.S. Holder provides its name and address on a properly executed IRS Form W8BEN or W-8BEN-E delivered to the applicable withholding agent, and certifies, under penalties of
perjury, that it is not a U.S. person as defined under the Code or (b) the Non-U.S. Holder holds its
Notes through certain intermediaries and satisfies the certification requirements under applicable
Regulations.

If a Non-U.S. Holder cannot satisfy the requirements described above, payments of interest made to such
Non-U.S. Holder on the Notes generally will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at the rate of 30%, unless the
Non-U.S. Holder provides the applicable withholding agent with a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN or W8BEN-E (or other applicable form) establishing an exemption from or reduction in the withholding tax under the
benefit of an applicable income tax treaty or IRS Form W-8ECI stating that interest paid on the Notes is not subject
to withholding tax because it is effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business in
the United States (as discussed below under “—U.S. Federal Income Tax”).

Subject to the discussion below under “—U.S. Federal Income Tax” and the discussions of backup
withholding and FATCA (as defined below), the 30% U.S. federal withholding tax generally will not apply to any
gain recognized by a Non-U.S. Holder on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of
a Note (other than amounts properly attributable to accrued and unpaid interest, which will be treated as described
above).

_U.S. Federal Income Tax_

Unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise, if a Non-U.S. Holder is engaged in a trade or
business in the United States and interest on a Note is effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or
business, then the Non-U.S. Holder will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on that interest on a net income basis
(although such Non-U.S. Holder will be exempt from the 30% U.S. federal withholding tax, provided the
certification requirements discussed above in “—U.S. Federal Withholding Tax” are satisfied) in the same manner
as if the Non-U.S. Holder were a U.S. person as defined under the Code. In addition, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a
corporation, such Non-U.S. Holder may be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% (or lower applicable income
tax treaty rate) of its effectively connected earnings and profits, subject to adjustments.

Subject to the discussion of FATCA below, a Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal
income tax on any gain recognized on a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note
(other than in respect of any amount representing accrued but unpaid interest on the Note, which is subject to the
rules discussed herein for interest), unless (i) the gain is effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct
of a trade or business in the United States (in which case, such gain generally will be subject to U.S. federal income
tax (and possibly the branch profits tax) in generally the same manner as applies to effectively connected interest
income described above), or (ii) the Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183
days or more during the taxable year of the disposition of a Note and certain other requirements are met (in which
case, such Non-U.S. Holder generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a flat rate of 30% (unless a lower
applicable income tax treaty rate applies) on any such Non-U.S. Holder’s gain (net of certain U.S.-source losses, if
any).


-----

_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_

Information returns will be filed with the IRS in connection with payments of interest on the Notes made to
a Non-U.S. Holder. Unless a Non-U.S. Holder complies with certification procedures to establish that it is not a
United States person, information returns may also be filed with the IRS in connection with the proceeds from a
sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note. A Non-U.S. Holder may be subject to
backup withholding on interest payments on the Notes or the proceeds from a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement
or other taxable disposition of the Notes unless such Non-U.S. Holder complies with certification procedures to
establish that it is not a United States person or otherwise establish an exemption. The certification procedures
required to claim the exemption from withholding tax on interest described above will eliminate backup withholding
as well. Copies of any information returns filed with the IRS may also be made available to the tax authorities in the
country in which a Non-U.S. Holder resides or is organized under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty.

Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules are not additional taxes and may be refunded or
credited against a Non-U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required information is timely
furnished to the IRS.

**Foreign Account Tax Compliance**

Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code and Regulations thereunder (“FATCA”) generally impose U.S.
federal withholding tax of 30% on interest income paid on a Note and, subject to proposed Regulations discussed
below, on the gross proceeds of a disposition of a Note paid to (i) a foreign financial institution (whether such
foreign financial institution is the beneficial owner or an intermediary), unless such institution enters into an
agreement with the U.S. government to collect and provide to the U.S. tax authorities substantial information
regarding U.S. account holders of such institution (which would include certain equity and debt holders of such
institution, as well as certain account holders that are foreign entities with U.S. owners), and, in certain cases, to
withhold on amounts paid to non-compliant U.S. account holders, or (ii) a foreign entity that is not a financial
institution (whether such foreign entity is the beneficial owner or an intermediary), unless such entity provides the
applicable withholding agent with a certification identifying the substantial U.S. owners of the entity, which
generally include any U.S. person who directly or indirectly owns more than 10% of the entity. An
intergovernmental agreement between the U.S. and the applicable foreign country, or future Regulations or other
guidance, may modify these requirements.

Proposed Regulations propose to eliminate potential FATCA withholding on the gross proceeds of a
disposition of a Note. The proposed Regulations provide that taxpayers may rely upon such proposal until final
Regulations are issued.

We will not pay additional amounts or “gross up” payments to holders of the Notes as a result of any taxes
or withholding imposed under FATCA. Under certain circumstances, a Non-U.S. Holder may be eligible for a
refund or credit of such tax or withholding. Each investor should consult with its tax advisor regarding the
implications of this legislation on its investment in the Notes.


-----

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the acquisition and holding of the
Notes by (i) employee benefit plans that are subject to Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended (“ERISA”), (ii) plans, individual retirement accounts and other arrangements that are subject to
Section 4975 of the Code, (iii) any other plan, account or arrangement that is subject to any other U.S. or non-U.S.
federal, state, local or other laws or regulations that are similar to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code
(collectively, “Similar Laws”), or (iv) entities and accounts whose underlying assets are considered to include “plan
assets” of any such plan, account or arrangement described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) pursuant to 29 C.F.R. Section
2510.3-101 (as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA) or any Similar Law (each of the foregoing described in clause
(i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) referred to herein as a “Plan”).

**General Fiduciary Matters**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to Title I of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (an “ERISA Plan”) and prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an
ERISA Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises
any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or
disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation
(direct or indirect) to such an ERISA Plan or has authority or responsibility to do so, is generally considered to be a
fiduciary of the ERISA Plan.

Any Plan fiduciary that proposes to cause a Plan to purchase the Notes should consult with its counsel
regarding the potential applicability of the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA and the prohibited
transaction provisions of Title I of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code and provisions of any Similar Law to such
an investment, and to confirm that the acquisition and holding of the Notes will not constitute or result in a nonexempt prohibited transaction or any other violation of an applicable requirement of ERISA, the Code or any
Similar Law or whether an exemption would be applicable to such acquisition and holding. In addition, in
considering an investment in the Notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a Plan fiduciary should determine
whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable
provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without
limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the
Code and any other applicable Similar Laws.

Each Plan should also consider the fact that none of the Issuer, the initial purchasers, any guarantors or any
of their respective affiliates (collectively, the “Transaction Parties”) is acting, or will act, as a fiduciary to any Plan
with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes pursuant to this offering. The Transaction Parties are not
undertaking to provide any investment advice in a fiduciary capacity with respect to such decision. All
communications, correspondence and materials from the Transaction Parties with respect to the Notes are intended
to be general in nature and are not directed at any specific purchaser of the Notes, and do not constitute advice
regarding the advisability of investment in the Notes for any specific purchaser. The decision to purchase and hold
the Notes must be made solely by each prospective Plan purchaser on an arm’s length basis.

**Prohibited Transaction Issues**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified
transactions involving “plan assets” with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of
Section 3(14) of ERISA, or “disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an
exemption is available. Those sections further prohibit a fiduciary from engaging in transactions in which a conflict
of interest is deemed present. The fiduciary of an ERISA Plan that proposes to purchase and hold any Notes should
consider, among other things, whether such purchase and holding may involve (i) the direct or indirect extension of
credit between an ERISA Plan and a party in interest or a disqualified person, (ii) the sale or exchange of any
property between an ERISA Plan and a party in interest or a disqualified person, or (iii) the transfer to, or use by or
for the benefit of, a party in interest or disqualified person, of any ERISA Plan assets. Such parties in interest or
disqualified persons could include, without limitation, the Issuer, the initial purchasers or any of their respective
affiliates. A party in interest or disqualified person (including a fiduciary) who engages in a non-exempt prohibited


-----

transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and/or the Code. In
addition, a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engages in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to
penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. The acquisition and/or holding of the Notes by an ERISA Plan
with respect to which an Issuer, an initial purchaser or a guarantor is considered a party in interest or a disqualified
person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or
Section 4975 of the Code, unless the Notes are acquired and held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or
individual prohibited transaction exemption.

In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”)
that may provide exemptive relief for direct or indirect prohibited transactions resulting from the acquisition and/or
holding of the Notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions
determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled
separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting life insurance
company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers. In
addition to the foregoing, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide a statutory
exemption for certain transactions between an ERISA Plan and a person that is a party in interest and/or a
disqualified person (other than a fiduciary or an affiliate that (directly or indirectly) has or exercises any
discretionary authority or control or renders any investment advice with respect to the assets of any ERISA Plan
involved in the transaction) solely by reason of providing services to the ERISA Plan or by relationship to a service
provider, provided that the ERISA Plan pays no more and receives no less than adequate consideration in connection
with the transaction. These exemptions do not, however, provide relief from the self-dealing prohibitions under
ERISA and the Code. It should also be noted that even if the conditions specified in one or more of these
exemptions are met, the scope of relief provided by these exemptions may not necessarily cover all acts that might
be construed as prohibited transactions. Therefore, the fiduciary of an ERISA Plan that is considering acquiring
and/or holding the Notes in reliance on any of these, or any other, exemptions should carefully review the exemption
and consult with its counsel to confirm that it is applicable. There can be no assurance that all of the conditions of
any such exemptions will be satisfied with respect to transactions involving the Notes.

Governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), non-U.S. plans (as described in Section
4(b)(4) of ERISA) and certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA), while not subject to the
fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA or Section 4975 of
the Code, may nevertheless be subject to Similar Laws which may affect their investment in the Notes. Any
fiduciary of a governmental, non-U.S. or such a church plan considering an investment in the Notes should consult
with its counsel before purchasing Notes to consider the applicable fiduciary standards and to determine the need
for, and, if necessary, the availability of, any exemptive relief under any applicable Similar Laws.

Because of the foregoing, the Notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing “plan assets”
of any Plan, unless such purchase or holding will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction
under ERISA or the Code or violation of any applicable Similar Laws.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive nor should it be
construed as legal advice. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons
involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries or other persons
considering purchasing or holding the Notes on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel
regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such investment
and whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the Notes.

Purchasers of the Notes have the exclusive responsibility for ensuring that their purchase and holding of the
Notes complies with the fiduciary responsibility rules of ERISA and does not violate the prohibited transaction rules
of ERISA or the Code or provisions of any applicable Similar Laws. Neither we nor the initial purchasers make any
representation as to whether an investment in the Notes is appropriate for Plans in general or whether such
investment is appropriate for any particular Plan. Neither this discussion nor anything in this offering circular is or is
intended to be investment advice directed at any potential purchaser that is a Plan or at such purchasers generally.


-----

**Representation**

Accordingly, by the acquisition and/or holding of a Note, or any interest in a Note, each purchaser and
subsequent transferee will be deemed to have represented and warranted that either (i) such purchaser or subsequent
transferee is not acquiring or holding the Notes for or on behalf of, and no portion of the assets used by such
purchaser or transferee to acquire or hold the Note, or any interest therein, constitutes assets of, any Plan or (ii) the
acquisition and holding of the Note by such purchaser or transferee will not constitute or result in a non-exempt
prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a similar violation under any
applicable Similar Laws, and none of the Transaction Parties is a fiduciary of such purchaser or transferee in
connection with its investment in the Notes pursuant to the offering described in this offering circular.


-----

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any other applicable
securities laws and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S.
persons (as such terms are defined in Regulation S) except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not
subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and such other securities laws. Accordingly, the Notes
are being offered only (a) to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers (as defined in Rule
144A) in reliance on the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act provided by Rule 144A
and (b) outside the United States, to persons other than U.S. persons, in offshore transactions in reliance upon
Regulation S.

Each purchaser of the Notes, by its acceptance thereof, will be deemed to have acknowledged, represented
to and agreed as follows (terms used in this paragraph that are defined in Rule 144A or Regulation S under the
Securities Act are used herein as defined therein):

(1) The purchaser (A) (i) is a qualified institutional buyer, (ii) is aware that the sale to it is being made
in reliance on Rule 144A and (iii) is acquiring the Notes for its own account or for the account of a
qualified institutional buyer or (B) is not a U.S. person and is purchasing the Notes in an offshore
transaction pursuant to Regulation S.

(2) The purchaser understands that the Notes are being offered in a transaction not involving any
public offering in the United States within the meaning of the Securities Act, that the Notes have
not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and that (A) if in the future it decides
to offer, resell, pledge or otherwise transfer any of the Notes such Notes may be offered, resold,
pledged or otherwise transferred only (i) to us, (ii) in the United States to a person who the seller
reasonably believes is a qualified institutional buyer in a transaction meeting the requirements of
Rule 144A, (iii) outside the United States in a transaction complying with the provisions of Rule
904 under the Securities Act, (iv) pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities
Act other than Rule 144 (even if available) or (v) pursuant to an effective registration statement
under the Securities Act, in each of clauses (i) through (v) in accordance with any applicable
securities laws of any state of the United States, and that (B) the purchaser will, and each
subsequent holder is required to, notify any subsequent purchaser of the Notes from it of the resale
restrictions referred to in (A) above.

(3) The purchaser understands that the Notes will bear a legend substantially to the following effect
(the “Restricted Notes Legend”):

THIS NOTE (OR ITS PREDECESSOR) WAS ORIGINALLY ISSUED IN A TRANSACTION
EXEMPT FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
AMENDED (THE “SECURITIES ACT”), AND THIS NOTE MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD OR
OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH REGISTRATION OR AN APPLICABLE

OF ANY STATE OF THE UNITED STATES, AND (B) THE HOLDER WILL, AND EACH
SUBSEQUENT HOLDER IS REQUIRED TO, NOTIFY ANY PURCHASER OF THIS NOTE FROM IT
OF THE RESALE RESTRICTIONS REFERRED TO HEREIN.

Each purchaser of Notes offered in reliance on Regulation S will be deemed to have represented
and agreed that it is not a U.S. person and is purchasing such Notes in an offshore transaction (as such
terms are defined in Regulation S) pursuant to Regulation S and understands that such Notes will, unless
otherwise agreed by us and the holder thereof, bear a legend substantially to the following effect (the
“Regulation S Legend”):

THIS NOTE (OR ITS PREDECESSOR) WAS ORIGINALLY ISSUED IN A TRANSACTION
ORIGINALLY EXEMPT FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
AMENDED (THE “SECURITIES ACT”), AND MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED IN THE UNITED
STATES OR TO, OR FOR THE ACCOUNT OR BENEFIT OF, ANY U.S. PERSON EXCEPT
PURSUANT TO AN AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF
THE SECURITIES ACT AND ALL APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. TERMS USED
ABOVE HAVE THE MEANINGS GIVEN TO THEM IN REGULATION S UNDER THE SECURITIES
ACT.

Notes bearing the Restricted Notes Legend may be exchanged for Notes not bearing the Restricted
Notes Legend but bearing the Regulation S Legend upon certification by the transferor in the form set forth
in the indenture governing the Notes that the transfer of any such restricted note has been made in
accordance with Rule 904 under the Securities Act. We understand that under current market practices
settlement of the transfer of any such Note may be effected through the facilities of DTC, but that prior to
the 40th day after the latest of the commencement of this offering and the last original issue date of the
Notes, any such transfer may only occur through the facilities of Euroclear and/or Clearstream. See the
section entitled “Book-Entry Settlement and Clearance.”

(4) Each purchaser and subsequent transferee of the Notes will be deemed to have represented and
agreed that either (i) no portion of the assets used by such purchaser or transferee to acquire and
hold the Notes constitutes assets of (A) any “employee benefit plans” that are defined in and
subject to Title I of ERISA, (B) any plans, individual retirement accounts and other arrangements
that are subject to Section 4975 of the Code, (C) any plan, account or other arrangement that is
subject to provisions under any Similar Laws, or (D) any entities or accounts the underlying assets
of which are considered to include “plan assets” of such employee benefit plans or plans, accounts
and arrangements described in clause (A), (B) or (C) pursuant to 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101 (as
modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA) or any Similar Law; or (ii) the purchaser or transferee’s
purchase and holding of the Notes will not constitute or result in a non-exempt “prohibited
transaction” under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or any similar violation
under any applicable Similar Laws, and none of the Transaction Parties is a fiduciary of such
purchaser or transferee in connection with its investment in the Notes pursuant to the offering
described in this offering circular.

(5) Each purchaser acknowledges that we, the initial purchasers and others will rely upon the truth and
accuracy of the foregoing acknowledgments, representations, warranties and agreements and
agrees that if any of the acknowledgments, representations, warranties and agreements deemed to
have been made by its purchase of the Notes are no longer accurate, it shall promptly notify us and
the initial purchasers. If it is acquiring any Notes as a fiduciary or agent for one or more investor
accounts, it represents that it has sole investment discretion with respect to each such investor
account and that it has full power to make the foregoing acknowledgments, representations and
agreements on behalf of each such investor account.

thereto and Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, as representative on behalf of the several initial purchasers named below,

jointly, to purchase from the Issuer, the principal amount of the Notes set forth opposite its name below.

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the purchase agreement, the initial purchasers have agreed,
severally and not jointly, to purchase all of the Notes sold under the purchase agreement if any of these Notes are
purchased. If an initial purchaser defaults, the purchase agreement provides that the purchase commitments of the
non-defaulting initial purchasers may be increased or the purchase agreement may be terminated.

We and the guarantors, jointly and severally, have agreed to indemnify the initial purchasers against certain
liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments the initial purchasers may be
required to make in respect of those liabilities.

The representative has advised us that the initial purchasers propose initially to offer the Notes for resale at
the offering price that appears on the cover of this offering circular. After the initial offering, the offering price of
the Notes and any other term of the offering may be changed. The initial purchasers may offer and sell Notes
through certain of their affiliates. The offering of the Notes by the initial purchasers is subject to receipt and
acceptance of orders by the initial purchasers and subject to the initial purchasers’ right to reject any order in whole
or in part.

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any
other jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Notes are subject to restrictions on resale and transfer as described under
“Transfer Restrictions.” In the purchase agreement, each of the initial purchasers has agreed that:

    - the Notes may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of,
U.S. persons except in accordance with Rule 144A or Regulation S under the Securities Act; and

    - during the initial distribution of the Notes, it will offer or sell Notes only to persons reasonably
believed to be qualified institutional buyers in compliance with Rule 144A and to non-U.S. persons
outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S.


-----

In addition, with respect to the Notes initially sold outside the United States in compliance with Regulation
S, until 40 days following the commencement of this offering, an offer or sale of Notes within the United States by a
dealer (whether or not participating in the offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act
unless the dealer makes the offer or sale in compliance with Rule 144A or another exemption from registration
under the Securities Act. Each purchaser of the Notes will be deemed to have made acknowledgments,
representations and agreements as described under “Transfer Restrictions.”

The Notes are a new issue of securities, and there is currently no established trading market for the Notes.
In addition, the Notes are subject to certain restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Transfer
Restrictions.” We do not intend to apply for the Notes to be listed on any securities exchange or to arrange for the
inclusion of the Notes on any automated dealer quotation system. Certain of the initial purchasers have advised us
that they intend to make a market in the Notes, but are not obligated to do so. The initial purchasers may discontinue
any market making in the Notes at any time in their sole discretion. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid
trading market for the Notes will develop or be maintained, that you will be able to sell your Notes at a particular
time or that the prices that you receive when you sell will be favorable. If the Notes are traded, they may trade at a
discount from their initial offering price, depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our
operating performance and financial condition, general economic conditions and other factors. In addition, the
ability of the initial purchasers to make a market in the Notes may be impacted by changes in any regulatory
requirements (including as a result of regulatory developments such as the SEC’s interpretation of Rule 15c2-11
and its application to debt securities) applicable to the marketing, holding and trading of, and issuing quotations
with respect to, the Notes.

The Issuer and the guarantors have agreed that they and their respective affiliates will not for a period of 90
days following the closing of this offering, without the prior written consent of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, offer,
sell or contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of (or enter into any transaction that is designed to, or might
reasonably be expected to, result in the disposition (whether by actual disposition or effective economic disposition
due to cash settlement or otherwise) by them or their respective affiliates or any person in privity with them or their
respective affiliates), directly or indirectly, or announce the offering of, any capital markets debt securities issued or
guaranteed by the Issuer or any of the guarantors.

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about , 2023, which
will be the     business day following the date of pricing of the Notes (such settlement cycle being herein referred
to as “T+     “). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required
to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly,
purchasers who wish to trade the Notes prior to the date that is two business days preceding the settlement date will
be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will settle T+    , to specify an alternate settlement cycle
at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of Notes who wish to trade Notes during such
period should consult their own advisor.

The initial purchasers and their affiliates have in the past engaged, currently engage in and may in the
future engage in transactions with and perform services for us, including commercial banking, financial advisory
and investment banking services, in the ordinary course of business for which they have received or will receive
customary fees and expenses. It is expected that affiliates of each of the initial purchasers will act as agents, joint
lead arrangers and joint bookrunners and/or lenders under our New Credit Facilities and will receive customary fees
for performing those services. Affiliates of each of the initial purchasers have provided commitments in respect of a
senior secured bridge facility. Commitments under such bridge facility will be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis
by the aggregate principal amount of notes sold in this offering and, as a result, the commitments held by such
affiliates will be ratably reduced. Furthermore, certain of the initial purchasers and/or their respective affiliates may
be lenders under the Existing Credit Agreement and/or holders of the Existing Notes, and therefore such initial
purchasers and/or their affiliates may receive a portion of the net proceeds of this offering used to finance the
Merger and the related Debt Refinancing. See “Use of Proceeds.”

In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the initial purchasers and their respective
affiliates, officers, directors and employees may purchase, sell or hold a broad array of investments and actively
trade securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments for
their own account and for the accounts of their customers, and such investment and trading activities may involve


-----

or relate to assets, securities and/or instruments of the Issuer (directly, as collateral securing other obligations or
otherwise) and/or persons and entities with relationships with the Issuer. The initial purchasers and their respective
affiliates may also communicate independent investment recommendations, market color or trading ideas and/or
publish or express independent research views in respect of such assets, securities or instruments and may at any
time hold, or recommend to clients that they should acquire, long and/or short positions in such assets, securities and
instruments.

If any of the initial purchasers or their affiliates has a lending relationship with us, certain of those initial
purchasers or their affiliates routinely hedge, and certain other of those initial purchasers or their affiliates may
hedge, their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. A typical hedging
strategy would include these initial purchasers or their affiliates hedging such exposure by entering into transactions
which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities,
including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely
affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby.

In connection with the offering of the Notes, the initial purchasers may engage in overallotment, stabilizing
transactions and syndicate covering transactions. Overallotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which
creates a short position for the initial purchasers. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the Notes in the
open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. Syndicate covering
transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to
cover short positions. Stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions may cause the price of the Notes
to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of those transactions. If the initial purchasers engage in
stabilizing or syndicate covering transactions, they may discontinue them at any time without notice. Neither we nor
any of the initial purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that
the transactions described above may have on the price of the Notes.

**European Economic Area**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). For these purposes,
a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of
Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97,
where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II;
or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”).
Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs
Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has
been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor
in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. This offering circular has been prepared on the basis that
any offer of Notes in any Member State of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus
Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes. This offering circular is not a
prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

The above selling restriction is in addition to any other selling restrictions set out below.

sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (“UK”). For these purposes, a retail
investor means a person who is one (or more) of (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation

(“EUWA”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000
(as amended, the “FSMA”) and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU)
2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of
Regulation (EU) 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor
as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK
Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) 1286/2014 as it


-----

forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes
or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling
the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK
PRIIPs Regulation. This offering circular has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in the UK will be
made pursuant to an exemption under the UK Prospectus Regulation and the FSMA from the requirement to publish
a prospectus for offers of Notes. This offering circular is not a prospectus for the purposes of the UK Prospectus
Regulation or the FSMA.

**NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

(Unaudited)

**1. Basis of Presentation**

**_The Company_**

Syneos Health, Inc. (the “Company”) is a global provider of end-to-end biopharmaceutical outsourcing solutions. The Company operates under two
reportable segments, Clinical Solutions and Commercial Solutions, and derives its revenue through a suite of services designed to enhance its
customers’ ability to successfully develop, launch, and market their products. The Company offers its solutions on both a standalone and integrated
basis with biopharmaceutical development and commercialization services ranging from Phase I to IV clinical trial services to services associated
with the commercialization of biopharmaceutical products. The Company’s customers include small, mid-sized, and large companies in the
biopharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device industries.

On May 10, 2023, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Star Parent, Inc., an affiliated entity
of Elliott Investment Management, Patient Square Capital, Veritas Capital (“Parent”), and Star Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent (“Merger Sub”). The Merger Agreement provides that, at closing (the “Effective Time”), Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company
(the “Merger”), with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. At closing, each share of Class
A common stock of the Company issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled and extinguished and, except for
limited exceptions, automatically converted into the right to receive $43.00 in cash (the “Merger Consideration”).

At a special meeting held on August 2, 2023, the Company’s stockholders approved the Merger Agreement. Certain regulatory approvals relating
to the Merger remain pending. If the Merger is consummated, the Company’s shares of Class A common stock will no longer trade on the Nasdaq
Stock Market LLC ("Nasdaq") and will be deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. As a result, the Company will
become a private company.

As of June 30, 2023, the Company has incurred approximately $23.0 million of costs in connection with the Merger and expects to continue to
incur significant costs and expenses, including fees for professional services and other transaction costs.

**_Unaudited Interim Financial Information_**

The Company prepared the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information. The significant accounting policies followed by
the Company for interim financial reporting are consistent with the accounting policies followed for annual financial reporting.

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, in management’s opinion, include all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary
for a fair presentation. The information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2022 (the “2022 Form 10-K”), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 16, 2023. The results of operations for the three and
six months ended June 30, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2023 or any other
future period. The unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022 is derived from the amounts in the audited consolidated
balance sheet included in the 2022 Form 10-K.

**2. Financial Statement Details**

**_Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash_**

Certain of the Company’s subsidiaries participate in a notional cash pooling arrangement to manage global liquidity requirements. As part of a

arrangement, the financial institution has the right, ability, and intent to offset a positive balance in one account against an overdrawn amount in
another account. Amounts in each of the accounts are unencumbered and unrestricted with respect to use. As such, the net cash balance related to
this pooling arrangement is included in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.

**5. Fair Value Measurements**

**_Assets and Liabilities Carried at Fair Value_**

As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company’s financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value included cash and cash equivalents,
restricted cash, trading securities, accounts receivable, unbilled services (including contract assets), accounts payable, accrued expenses, deferred
revenue, contingent obligations, liabilities under the accounts receivable financing agreement, and derivative instruments.

The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, unbilled services (including contract assets), accounts payable,
accrued expenses, deferred revenue, and the liabilities under the accounts receivable financing agreement approximate their respective carrying
amounts because of the liquidity and short-term nature of these financial instruments.

(a) Represents the fair value of investments in mutual funds based on quoted market prices that are used to fund the liability associated with the
Company’s deferred compensation plan.

(b) The Company has committed to invest $21.5 million as a limited partner in two private equity funds. The private equity funds invest in
opportunities in the healthcare and life sciences industry. As of June 30, 2023, the Company’s remaining unfunded commitment in the private equity
funds was $5.9 million. The Company holds minor ownership interests (less than 3%) in each of the private equity funds and has determined that it
does not exercise significant influence over the private equity funds’ operating and finance activities. As the private equity funds do not have readily
determinable fair values, the Company has estimated the fair values using each fund’s Net Asset Value, the amount by which the value of all assets
exceeds all debt and liabilities, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 946, Financial Services – Investment
_Companies._

(c) Represents the fair value of interest rate swap arrangements (see “Note 4 – Derivatives” for further information).

(d) Represents the fair value of contingent consideration obligations related to acquisitions. The fair values of these liabilities are determined
based on the Company’s best estimate of the probable timing and amount of settlement.

The following table presents a reconciliation of changes in the carrying amount of contingent obligations classified as Level 3 for the six
months ended June 30, 2023 (in thousands):

(a) During the three months ended June 30, 2023, the Company made payments in connection with the acquisition of RxDataScience, Inc.
(“RxDataScience”) completed during 2021.

During the six months ended June 30, 2023, there were no transfers of assets or liabilities between Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 fair value
measurements.

**_Financial Instruments Subject to Non-Recurring Fair Value Measurements_**

Certain assets, including goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, are carried on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets at cost
and, subsequent to initial recognition, are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis when certain identified events or changes in
circumstances that may have a significant adverse effect on the carrying values of these assets occur. These assets are classified as Level 3 fair
value measurements within the fair value hierarchy. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in
circumstances indicate a triggering event has occurred. Intangible assets are tested for impairment upon the occurrence of certain triggering events.
As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, assets carried on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets and not remeasured to fair
value on a recurring basis totaled $5.53 billion and $5.59 billion, respectively.

**_Fair Value Disclosures for Financial Instruments Not Carried at Fair Value_**

The estimated fair values of the Term A Facility and the Notes are determined based on the price that the Company would have had to pay to settle
the liabilities. As these liabilities are not actively traded, they are classified as Level 2 fair value measurements. The estimated fair values of the
Company’s Term A Facility and the Notes were as follows (in thousands):

**June 30, 2023** **December 31, 2022**
**Carrying** **Estimated** **Carrying** **Estimated**
**Value (a)** **Fair Value** **Value (a)** **Fair Value**

**6. Restructuring and Other Costs**

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company incurred employee severance and benefit costs, leased facility closure
and related costs, and other costs related to its restructuring activities. The costs incurred during the current year were primarily related to the
Company’s real estate optimization initiative to close or reduce office space that is no longer being utilized. For the six months ended June 30, 2023,
this includes $56.7 million of accelerated amortization of operating lease right-of-use assets and $18.3 million of accelerated depreciation of property
and equipment, both of which are non-cash expenses. The costs incurred during the prior year were primarily related to the Company’s margin
enhancement initiatives and specific actions focused on streamlining the operations of its Clinical Solutions segment to optimize efficiency and
enhance the delivery of customer projects. The Company expects to continue to incur costs related to its business transformation initiatives during
the remainder of 2023 and beyond as the Company continues the ongoing evaluations of its global workforce and facilities infrastructure needs to
improve customer engagement, increase innovation, and achieve operating efficiencies. However, in connection with the pendency of the Merger,
the Company has suspended certain aspects of its business transformation initiatives.

Restructuring and other costs consisted of the following (in thousands):

**Three Months Ended** **Six Months Ended**

**June 30,** **June 30,**
**2023** **2022** **2023** **2022**

Other costs 269 2,944 463 4,000
Total restructuring and other costs $ 10,641 $ 8,983 $ 95,328 $ 24,540

**_Accrued Restructuring Liabilities_**

The following table summarizes activity related to employee severance and benefit costs within accrued restructuring liabilities for the six
months ended June 30, 2023 (in thousands):

Balance as of December 31, 2022 $ 12,804
Expenses incurred (a) 15,749
Payments (19,881)
Balance as of June 30, 2023 $ 8,672


-----

(a) The amount of expenses incurred for the six months ended June 30, 2023 excludes $0.5 million of other costs that were paid through accounts
payable and $79.1 million of leased facility closure and related costs that are primarily reflected as reductions of operating lease right-of-use assets
and property and equipment, net on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet.

The Company expects the employee severance and benefit costs accrued as of June 30, 2023 will be paid within the next twelve months and are
included within accrued expenses on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet.

**7. Shareholders’ Equity**

**_Stock Repurchase Programs_**

On May 25, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) authorized the repurchase of up to an aggregate of $350.0 million of the
Company’s Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, to be executed from time to time in open market transactions effected through a
broker at prevailing market prices, in block trades, or through privately negotiated transactions through December 31, 2024 (the “2022 Stock
Repurchase Program”). The 2022 Stock Repurchase Program replaced a prior repurchase program approved on November 17, 2020, that took effect
on January 1, 2021.

The 2022 Stock Repurchase Program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any particular amount of the Company’s Class A common stock,
and may be modified, extended, suspended, or discontinued at any time. The timing and amount of repurchases will be determined by the
Company’s management based on a variety of factors such as the market price of the Company’s Class A common stock, the Company’s corporate
cash requirements, and overall market conditions. The 2022 Stock Repurchase Program is subject to applicable legal requirements, including federal
and state securities laws and applicable Nasdaq rules. The Company may also repurchase shares of its Class A common stock pursuant to a trading
plan meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which would permit shares of the Company’s
Class A common stock to be repurchased when the Company might otherwise be precluded from doing so by law.

During the three months ended June 30, 2023, there were no repurchases under the 2022 Stock Repurchase Program. As of June 30, 2023, the
Company had remaining authorization to repurchase up to $350.0 million of shares of its Class A common stock under the 2022 Stock Repurchase
Program.

based on the application of the treasury stock method. Potential common shares are also considered anti-dilutive in periods when the Company incurs
a net loss.

The number of potential shares outstanding that were anti-dilutive and therefore excluded from the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share,
weighted for the portion of the period they were outstanding, were as follows (in thousands):

**Three Months Ended** **Six Months Ended**

Total Class A common stock equivalents excluded from diluted

loss per share 1,102 774 1,759 470

**9. Income Taxes**

**_Income Tax (Benefit) Expense_**

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company recorded income tax benefits of $0.1 million and $3.1 million, respectively, on pretax income of $0.7 million and a pre-tax loss of $74.5 million, respectively. The income tax benefits for the three and six months ended June 30,
2023 included discrete tax expense of $0.9 million and $6.5 million, respectively, primarily related to tax shortfalls from share-based compensation.
The effective tax rates for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, excluding discrete items, varied from the United States (“U.S.”) federal
statutory income tax rate of 21.0% primarily due to foreign tax credits, foreign income inclusions such as the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income
(“GILTI”) provisions, and research and development credits.

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, the Company recorded income tax expense of $25.9 million and $33.3 million, respectively, on
pre-tax income of $103.7 million and $157.2 million, respectively. Income tax expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 included
discrete tax benefits of $0.3 million and $ 6.4 million, respectively, primarily related to excess tax benefits from share-based compensation. The
effective tax rates for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, excluding discrete items, varied from the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate
of 21.0% primarily due to state and local taxes on U.S. income, foreign income inclusions such as the GILTI provisions, and research and
development credits.

**_Unrecognized Tax Benefits_**

The Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits, exclusive of associated interest and penalties, were $19.8 million and $16.8 million as of June 30,
2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The increase of $3.0 million was primarily due to new positions related to prior years. The Company
believes it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by approximately $3.4 million within the next 12 months as a result
of lapses in statutes of limitations.

**_Tax Returns under Audit_**

The Company is not currently under any U.S. federal income tax audits, however, income tax returns are under examination by tax authorities in
several state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s federal and state tax filings are open to investigations in numerous years due to net operating
loss carryforwards. Additionally, the Company currently has an ongoing examination for tax years 2014 to 2020 in the United Kingdom. The United
Kingdom is the jurisdiction with the Company’s largest foreign operations. The Company believes that its reserve for uncertain tax positions is
adequate to cover existing risks or exposures related to all open tax years and jurisdictions.

**10. Revenue from Contracts with Customers**

**_Unsatisfied Performance Obligations_**

As of June 30, 2023, the total aggregate transaction price allocated to the unsatisfied performance obligations under contracts with contract terms
greater than one year and that are not accounted for as a series pursuant to ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers and all the
related amendments was $5.50 billion. This amount includes revenue associated with reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses. The Company expects
to recognize revenue over the remaining contract term of the individual projects, with contract terms generally ranging from one to five years. The
amount of unsatisfied performance obligations is presented net of any constraints and, as a result, is lower than the potential contractual revenue.
The contracts excluded due to constraints include contracts that do not commence within a certain period of time or that require the Company to
undertake numerous activities to fulfill these performance obligations, including various activities that are outside of the Company’s control.


-----

**_Timing of Billing and Performance_**

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company recognized approximately $357.2 million and $549.4 million, respectively, of
revenue that was included in the deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the respective periods. During the three and six months ended June
30, 2023, there were reductions of approximately $ 27.0 million and $ 36.6 million, respectively, in the Company’s revenue recognized related to
performance obligations partially satisfied in previous periods. The gross and net amounts of revenue recognized solely from changes in estimates
were not material.

**11. Segment Information**

The Company is managed through two reportable segments: Clinical Solutions and Commercial Solutions. Each reportable segment consists of
multiple service offerings that, when combined, create a leading fully integrated biopharmaceutical solutions organization built to accelerate
customer success. The Company translates unique clinical, medical affairs and commercial insights into outcomes to address modern market realities.
Clinical Solutions offers comprehensive global services for the development of diagnostics, drugs, biologics, devices, and digital therapeutics that
span Phase I to IV of clinical development. The segment is organized around clinical pharmacology and bioanalytical services, workforce
deployment, full-service clinical studies, real world evidence, and consulting. This segment offers individual services including regulatory
consulting, project management, protocol development, investigational site recruitment, clinical monitoring, technology-enabled patient recruitment
and engagement, clinical home health services, clinical trial diversity, biometrics, and regulatory affairs; all across a comprehensive range of
therapeutic areas. Commercial Solutions provides the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and healthcare industries with commercialization services,
including deployment solutions, communications solutions (public relations, advertising, and medical communications), and consulting services.

The Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (the “CODM”) reviews segment performance and allocates resources based upon segment revenue
and income from operations. Inter-segment revenue is eliminated from the segment reporting provided to the CODM and is not included in the
segment revenue presented in the table below. Certain costs are not allocated to the Company’s reportable segments and are reported as general
corporate expenses. These costs primarily consist of share-based compensation, general operating expenses associated with the Board and the
Company’s senior leadership, finance, investor relations, and internal audit functions, and transaction, integration-related, and other expenses. The
Company does not allocate depreciation, amortization, asset impairment charges, or restructuring and other costs to its segments. Additionally, the
CODM reviews the Company’s assets on a consolidated basis and does not allocate assets to its reportable segments for purposes of assessing
segment performance or allocating resources.

**13. Concentration of Credit Risk**

Financial assets that subject the Company to credit risk primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and unbilled services
(including contract assets). The Company’s cash and cash equivalents consist principally of cash and are maintained at several financial institutions
with reputable credit ratings. The Company's deposits at certain of these institutions exceed insured limits. The Company maintains cash depository
accounts with several financial institutions worldwide and is exposed to credit risk related to the potential inability to access liquidity in financial
institutions where its cash and cash equivalents are concentrated. In the event of failure of any of the financial institutions where the Company
maintains its cash and cash equivalents, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to access uninsured funds in a timely manner or at
all. The Company has not historically incurred any losses with respect to these balances and believes that it bears minimal credit risk.

As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, substantially all of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents were held within the U.S.

No single customer accounted for greater than 10% of the Company’s revenue for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022.

As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, no single customer accounted for greater than 10% of the Company’s accounts receivable and unbilled
services (including contract assets) balances.

**14. Related-Party Transactions**

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company had combined revenue of $ 2.3 million and $4.7 million, respectively, from five
customers whose board of directors each included a member who was also a member of the Company’s Board. As of June 30, 2023, the Company
had combined receivables of $1.5 million from three customers whose board of directors included a member who was also a member of the
Company’s Board.

On February 8, 2022, the Company completed an insignificant acquisition, which was associated with the 2021 acquisition of RxDataScience,
through an arm’s-length transaction. A member of the Company’s management was a minority shareholder of the acquired company.

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, the Company had combined revenue of $ 2.2 million and $3.6 million, respectively, from four
customers whose board of directors each included a member who was also a member of the Company’s Board. As of June 30, 2022, the Company
had combined receivables of $0.3 million from two customers whose board of directors included a member who was also a member of the
Company’s Board.

**15. Commitments and Contingencies**

**_Legal Proceedings_**

From time to time, the Company is a party to various litigation matters that are considered routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of
business. In the opinion of management, the outcome of any existing claims and legal or regulatory proceedings, other than certain proceedings
relating to the Merger and the putative class action lawsuit filed on July 27, 2023, as described below, if decided adversely, is not expected to
have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

**_Securities Class Actions_**

On July 27, 2023, a putative stockholder of the Company (the “Plaintiff”) filed a putative class action lawsuit, captioned United Association of
Plumbers and Pipefitters, Journeymen, Local #38 Defined Benefit Pension Plan vs. Syneos Health, Inc. et al. in the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York against the Company and certain of its current and former executive officers (the “UAPP Defendants”). In its
complaint, the Plaintiff alleges that the UAPP Defendants violated Section 10(b) and Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, by allegedly disseminating or approving statements, which they knew or deliberately disregarded were false and misleading. The lawsuit
brings claims on behalf of a putative class of purchasers of the Company’s Class A common stock between September 9, 2020 and November 3,
2022, and seeks compensatory damages, attorneys’ fees and costs, and any equitable or injunctive relief the court deems just and proper.

On December 1, 2017, the first of two virtually identical actions alleging federal securities law claims was filed against the Company and certain of
its officers on behalf of a putative class of its shareholders. The first action, captioned Bermudez v. INC Research, Inc., et al, No. 17-09457
(S.D.N.Y.), was filed in the Southern District of New York (the “Bermudez action”), and the second action, Vaitkuvienë v. Syneos Health, Inc., et
al, No. 18-0029 (E.D.N.C.), was filed on January 25, 2018 in the Eastern District of North Carolina (the “Vaitkuvienë action”). On March 30, 2018,
the Bermudez action was dismissed voluntarily. After the San Antonio Fire & Police Pension Fund and El Paso Firemen & Policemen’s Pension
Fund were appointed as Lead Plaintiffs in the Vaitkuvienë action, Lead Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on July 30, 2018, which named as
defendants the Company, Alistair Macdonald, Gregory S. Rush, Michael A. Bell, and each member of the Company’s Board at the time of the
stockholder vote on the 2017 merger (the “Merger”) of INC Research with an affiliate of inVentiv Health, Inc. (“inVentiv”) (collectively, the
“Vaitkuvienë Defendants”). The amended complaint alleged claims under Sections 10(b), 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
on behalf of a putative class of purchasers of the Company’s common stock between May 10, 2017 and November 8, 2017, contending that the
Company published inaccurate or incomplete information regarding, among other things, the financial performance and business outlook for
inVentiv’s business prior to and following the Merger. Lead Plaintiffs sought, among other things, orders (i) declaring that the lawsuit is a proper
class action and (ii) awarding compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial, including interest thereon, and reasonable costs and
expenses incurred in this action, including attorneys’ fees and expert fees, to Lead Plaintiffs and other class members. On September 20, 2018, the
Vaitkuvienë Defendants moved to dismiss the action. On August 30, 2021, the District Court entered an order granting the motion to dismiss in its
entirety, and on October 21, 2021, the Court entered judgment for the Vaitkuvienë Defendants. On November 19, 2021, Lead Plaintiffs appealed
from this judgment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, and, on July 24, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit
affirmed the District Court judgment in favor of defendants.

**_Merger-Related Proceedings_**

Five lawsuits (collectively, the “Merger Lawsuits”) have been filed by alleged stockholders of the Company against the Company, its directors, and
its advisors related to the Merger: O’Dell v. Syneos Health, Inc. et al, Case No. 23-cv-5312, was filed in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York on June 22, 2023; Wang v. Syneos Health, Inc. et al, Case No. 23-cv-05410, was filed in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York on June 26, 2023; Delman v. Syneos Health, Inc. et al, Case No. 616711/2023, was filed in the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of Suffolk, on July 7, 2023; Kent v. Syneos Health, Inc. et al, Case No. 1:23-cv-00749, was filed
in the United States District Court of Delaware on July 10, 2023; and Williams v. Syneos Health, Inc. et al, Case No. 23-cv-05867, was filed in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on July 10, 2023.

Each of the complaints name as defendants the Company and certain members of the Board, and the Delman complaint also names as defendants
Centerview, BofA Securities, Broadridge, and the Company's proxy solicitors. Each of the complaints (other than the Delman complaint) allege
violations of Sections 14(e) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder. The O’Dell and Wang
complaints generally allege that the Schedule 14(a) Preliminary Proxy Statement, filed with the SEC on June 15, 2023, and the Kent and Williams
complaints generally allege that the definitive proxy statement filed with the SEC on June 27, 2023 (the “Proxy Statement”), omit material
information with respect to the proposed transaction and the valuation analyses performed by the Company’s financial advisors regarding the
proposed transaction, which renders the Proxy Statement false and misleading. The Delman complaint alleged violations of the North Carolina
Securities Act and negligent misrepresentation and concealment under North Carolina and New York common law by the Company, the members
of the Board, Centerview, BofA Securities, Broadridge, and the Company’s proxy solicitors.

The complaints seek, among other relief, to enjoin the Company from consummating the Merger and to be awarded rescissory damages, as well as
attorneys’ fees, costs, and disbursements. On August 1 and August 2, 2023, respectively, the O'Dell and Delman actions were voluntarily dismissed
following the publication of additional disclosures by the Company. The Company believes that the putative class action lawsuit filed on July 27,
2023 and the Merger Lawsuits are without merit and intends to defend vigorously against the allegations made by the respective plaintiffs;
however, the Company cannot predict the amount of time and expense that will be required to resolve the complaints. In addition, the outcome of
such litigation or any other litigation is necessarily uncertain.


-----

The Company is presently unable to predict the duration, scope, or result of the putative class action lawsuit filed on July 27, 2023 or the Merger
Lawsuits, or any other related lawsuit. As such, the Company is presently unable to develop a reasonable estimate of a possible loss or range of
losses, if any, related to these matters. The Company could be forced to expend significant resources in the defense of these lawsuits or future ones,
and it may not prevail. As such, these matters could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, annual, or interim results of
operations, cash flows, or its financial condition. The Company is not aware of the filing of other lawsuits challenging the Merger or the related
Proxy Statement; however, additional lawsuits arising out of the Merger or the Proxy Statement may be filed in the future, which could prevent or
delay completion of the Merger and result in substantial costs to the Company, including any costs associated with indemnification.

**REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM**

To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Syneos Health, Inc.

**Opinion on the Financial Statements**

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Syneos Health, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022
and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and shareholders’ equity, for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated
_Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 15,_ 2023,
expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

**Basis for Opinion**

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with
respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included
performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing
procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

**Critical Audit Matter**

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated
or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and
(2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our
opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate
opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

**_Revenue – Full-service Clinical Contracts – Refer to Notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements_**

_Critical Audit Matter Description_

The majority of the Company’s Clinical Solutions segment contracts have a single performance obligation because the promise to transfer individual
services is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts, and therefore, is not distinct. Revenue is recognized over time using an
input measure of progress. The input measure reflects costs (including investigator payments and pass-through costs) incurred to date relative to total
estimated costs to complete (“cost-to-cost measure of progress”). Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress methodology, revenue is recorded
proportionally to costs incurred. Contract costs principally include direct labor, investigator payments, and pass-through costs. The accounting for
these contracts involves judgment, particularly as it relates to estimating total contract costs based on the scope of work, the complexity of the
clinical trial services, the geographical locations involved, industry information, and historical experience, among other factors.

Given the judgments necessary to estimate total contract costs in order to estimate the amount of revenue to recognize for certain long-term clinical
research contracts, which use the cost-to-cost method, auditing such estimates required extensive audit effort due to the complexity of these
contracts and a high degree of auditor judgment when performing audit procedures and evaluating the results of those procedures.

_How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit_

Our audit procedures related to management’s estimates of total contract costs to determine the amount of revenue to recognize for full-service
clinical research contracts included the following, among others:

   - We tested the effectiveness of controls over long-term contract revenue, including those over the estimates of total contract costs related
to the performance obligation.

   - We selected a sample of long-term contracts and performed the following:


-----

Evaluated whether the contracts were properly included in management’s calculation of long-term contract revenue based on the
terms and conditions of each contract, including whether continuous transfer of control to the customer occurred as progress was
made toward fulfilling the performance obligation.

Compared the transaction prices to the consideration expected to be received based on current rights and obligations under the
contracts and any contract modifications that were agreed upon with the customers.

Evaluated management’s identification of distinct performance obligations by assessing whether the underlying services were
highly interdependent and interrelated.

Tested the accuracy and completeness of the total contract costs incurred to date for the performance obligation.

Evaluated the estimates of total contract cost for the performance obligation by:

         - Evaluating management’s ability to achieve the estimates of total contract cost by performing corroborating inquiries with the
Company’s project managers and project financial analysts and comparing the estimates to management’s work plans and cost
estimates.

         - Comparing management’s estimates of cost and revenue for the selected contracts to historical experience and evaluating the
reasonableness of management’s forecast of remaining costs to be incurred for each contract based on progress to date.

Tested the mathematical accuracy of management’s calculation of revenue for the performance obligation.

   - We evaluated management’s ability to accurately estimate total contract costs and revenue by comparing actual costs to
management’s historical estimates for performance obligations that have been fulfilled.

**_Goodwill – Communications Reporting Unit – Refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements_**

_Critical Audit Matter Description_

The Company’s goodwill impairment test involves comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit, including goodwill, to its carrying value
using a qualitative or quantitative analysis. During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company performed a quantitative analysis for its Communications
reporting unit, which had a goodwill balance of $529.1 million as of December 31, 2022. The Company estimated the fair value of its
Communications reporting unit using the income approach. This approach incorporated a discounted cash flow model in which the estimated future
cash flows of the reporting unit were discounted using a risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital. The determination of fair value for the
Communications reporting unit required management to make significant judgments and estimates that are subject to uncertainty as actual results
could be different than those judgments and estimates used in the impairment test, which may result in an impairment charge in the future. The
Company concluded that the estimated fair value of its Communications reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately $19.0 million,
or 3%, and therefore no impairment existed.

We identified the quantitative analysis of the Communications reporting unit as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments made by
management to estimate its fair value. Auditing the discounted cash flow calculations for this reporting unit involved a high degree of auditor
judgment and an increased effort, which included the involvement of our fair value specialists, as it related to evaluating management’s
assumptions and estimates related to future growth rates, margin projections, timing of future cash flows and the discount rate.

_How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit_

Our audit procedures related to the assumptions and estimates of future growth rates, margin projections, timing of future cash flows and the discount
rate used by management to estimate the fair value of the Communications reporting unit included the following, among others:

   - We tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s goodwill impairment analysis, including those over the selection of the
discount rate and management’s development of forecasts of future growth rates, timing of cash flows and margin projections.

   - We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s forecasts by comparing the forecasts to (1) historical forecasts and the associated
actual results, (2) internal communications to management, and (3) forecasted information included in analyst and industry reports
for the Company and certain of its peer companies.

   - With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated (1) the valuation methodology used and (2) the projections of future growth
rates and the discount rate by testing the underlying source information including the mathematical accuracy of the calculations, and by
developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the rate selected by management.

**REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM**

To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Syneos Health, Inc.

**Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting**

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Syneos Health, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022,
based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the
consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, of the Company and our report dated February 15, 2023
expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

**Basis for Opinion**

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S.
federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

**Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting**

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

**Syneos Health, Inc. and Subsidiaries**

**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements**

**1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies**

**_Principal Business_**

Syneos Health, Inc. (the “Company”) is a global provider of end-to-end biopharmaceutical outsourcing solutions. The Company operates under two
reportable segments, Clinical Solutions and Commercial Solutions, and derives its revenue through a suite of services designed to enhance its
customers’ ability to successfully develop, launch, and market their products. The Company offers its solutions on both a standalone and integrated
basis with biopharmaceutical development and commercialization services ranging from Phase I to IV clinical trial services to services associated
with the commercialization of biopharmaceutical products. The Company’s customers include small, mid-sized, and large companies in the
biopharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device industries.

**_Principles of Consolidation_**

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), and include the accounts and results of operations of the Company and its controlled subsidiaries. All
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

**_Reclassification_**

Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

**_Macroeconomic Environment_**

The Company’s business and operations have been and are expected to continue to be impacted by various risks and uncertainties, including but not
limited to, the broad effects of the current macroeconomic environment on the global economy and major financial markets, including interest rate
increases, inflation, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as well as other risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

**_Use of Estimates_**

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions.
These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the
date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses for the periods presented in the financial statements. Examples of
estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, determining the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets and their potential impairment,
useful lives of tangible and intangible assets, useful lives of assets subject to leases, valuation of the Company’s right of use assets, allowances for
doubtful accounts, potential future outcomes of events for which income tax consequences have been recognized in the Company’s consolidated
financial statements or tax returns, valuation allowances for deferred tax assets, fair value of share-based compensation and its recognition period,
loss contingencies, fair value of derivative instruments and related hedge effectiveness, fair value of contingent tax sharing obligations, and
judgments related to revenue recognition, among others. In addition, estimates and assumptions are used in the accounting for acquisitions, including
the fair value and useful lives of acquired tangible and intangible assets and the fair value of assumed liabilities.

The Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and bases its estimates on historical experience, current and expected
future conditions, third-party evaluations, and various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances based on
the information available to management at the time these estimates and assumptions are made. Actual results and outcomes may differ significantly
from these estimates and assumptions.

**_Acquisitions_**

The Company accounts for acquisitions in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, using the acquisition method of accounting.
The purchase price, or total consideration transferred, is determined as the fair value of assets exchanged, equity instruments issued, and liabilities
assumed at the acquisition date. The acquisition method of accounting requires that the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any
non-controlling interest in the acquiree are measured and recorded at their fair values on the date of an acquisition. Goodwill represents the excess
of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired, including the amount assigned to identifiable intangible assets.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. The consolidated financial statements reflect the results of operations of the acquiree from the
date of the acquisition. For additional information, see “Note 3 – Acquisitions, Divestitures, and Investments.”

**_Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions_**

For subsidiaries outside of the United States (“U.S.”) that operate in a local currency environment, revenue and expenses are translated to U.S.
dollars at the monthly average rates of exchange prevailing during the period, assets and liabilities are translated at period-end exchange rates, and
equity accounts are translated at historical exchange rates. The net effect of foreign currency translation adjustments is included in shareholders’
equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.


-----

Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are the result of exchange rate changes during the period of time between the consummation and cash
settlement of transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recognized
in earnings as incurred and are included in other expense (income), net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

**_Comprehensive Income_**

Comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains, and losses that, under U.S. GAAP, are recorded as an element of shareholders’ equity but
are excluded from net income. The Company’s comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation adjustments, net of applicable taxes,
resulting from the translation of foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar and the effective portions of the unrealized
gains or losses associated with derivative instruments designated and accounted for as hedging instruments.

**_Cash and Cash Equivalents_**

Cash and cash equivalents consist of demand deposits with banks and other financial institutions and highly liquid investments with an original
maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase. Cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates their fair value.

Certain of the Company’s subsidiaries participate in a notional cash pooling arrangement to manage global liquidity requirements. As part of a
master netting arrangement, the participants combine their cash balances in pooling accounts at the same financial institution with the ability to
offset bank overdrafts of one participant against positive cash account balances held by another participant. Under the terms of the master netting
arrangement, the financial institution has the right, ability, and intent to offset a positive balance in one account against an overdrawn amount in
another account. Amounts in each of the accounts are unencumbered and unrestricted with respect to use. As such, the net cash balance related to
this pooling arrangement is included in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

The Company’s net cash pool position consisted of the following as of December 31 (in thousands):

**2022** **2021**
Gross cash position $ 283,337 $ 179,160
Less: cash borrowings (283,029) (167,507)
Net cash position $ 308 $ 11,653

**_Restricted Cash_**

Restricted cash represents cash and deposits held as security over bank deposits, lease guarantees, and insurance obligations that are restricted as
to withdrawal or use. Restricted cash is classified as a current or long-term asset based on the timing and nature of when and how the cash is
expected to be used or when the restrictions are expected to lapse. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, restricted cash balances were $0.1 million.

**_Fair Value_**

The Company records certain assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement (see “Note 6 - Fair
Value Measurements”). Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most
advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. This guidance also
specifies a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between valuation assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent external
sources and the reporting entity’s own assumptions. Fair value measurements are classified according to the lowest level input or value-driver that is
significant to the valuation. In accordance with this guidance, fair value measurements are classified under the following hierarchy:

Level 1 – Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments;

Level 2 – Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not
active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs or significant value-drivers are observable in active markets; and

Level 3 – Model-derived valuations in which one or more significant inputs or significant value-drivers are unobservable, including
internally developed models.

**_Derivative Financial Instruments_**

_Interest Rate Swaps_

The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage exposure to variable interest rates on its debt obligations. The Company designates its interest
rate swaps as cash flow hedges because they are executed to hedge the Company’s exposure to the variability in expected future cash flows that
are attributable to changes in interest rates.

Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value and recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in prepaid expenses
and other current assets, other long-term assets, accrued expenses, and other long-term liabilities, as disclosed in “Note 5 – Derivatives.” The fair
value of interest rate swaps is determined using the market standard methodology of discounted future variable cash receipts. The variable cash
receipts are determined by discounting the future expected cash receipts that would occur if variable interest


-----

rates rise above the fixed rate of the swaps. The variable interest rates used in the calculation of projected receipts on the swap are based on an
expectation of future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves and volatilities. Changes in the fair value of derivative
instruments designated as hedging instruments are recorded each period according to the determination of the derivative’s effectiveness. The
effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and
subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of the
change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized as non-operating income or expense immediately when incurred and included in interest expense
in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

_Foreign Exchange Forward_

From time to time, the Company utilizes a foreign exchange forward in order to minimize monthly foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses
on non-functional currency monetary balances. The Company did not designate the derivative as a hedge. All changes in the fair value of the
foreign exchange forward are recorded in earnings every month to other expense (income), net in the accompanying consolidated statements of
income, as disclosed in “Note 5 – Derivatives.”

**_Allowance for Doubtful Accounts_**

The Company maintains a credit approval process and makes judgments in connection with assessing its customers’ ability to pay for contracted
services. Generally, the Company has the ability to limit credit exposure by discontinuing services in the event of non-payment. The Company
monitors its customers’ credit worthiness and applies judgment in establishing a provision for estimated credit losses based on historical experience,
the aging of receivables, and customer-specific circumstances that would affect the customers’ ability to pay for services rendered.

**_Property and Equipment_**

Property and equipment primarily consists of furniture, vehicles, software, office equipment, computer equipment, and lab equipment. Purchased and
constructed property and equipment is initially recorded at historical cost plus the estimated value of any associated legally or contractually required
retirement obligations. Property and equipment acquired in an acquisition are recorded based on the estimated fair value as of the acquisition date.
The Company leases vehicles for certain sales representatives in the Commercial Solutions segment. These leases are classified and accounted for as
leases in accordance with ASC Topic 842, Leases (“ASC 842”). For further information about lease arrangements, see “Note 19 - Leases.”

Property and equipment assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over the respective estimated useful lives as follows:

**Useful Life**
Buildings 39 years
Furniture and fixtures 7 years
Equipment 5 to 10 years
Computer equipment and software 2 to 3 years
Vehicles Lesser of lease term or the estimated economic life of the leased asset
Leasehold improvements Lesser of remaining life of lease or the useful life of the asset

Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred and expenditures for major improvements that increase the functionality or
extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset.

The Company capitalizes costs of computer software obtained for internal use and amortizes these costs on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful life of the product, not to exceed five years. Software cloud computing arrangements containing a software license are
accounted for consistently with the acquisition of other software licenses. In the event such an arrangement does not contain a software license,
the Company accounts for the arrangement as a service contract.

The Company reviews property and equipment for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets
might not be recoverable. For assessment purposes, property and equipment are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level that
identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of the carrying amount of an asset
group is assessed by comparing its carrying amount to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group. If
the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized for the excess.

**_Leases_**

At inception, a contract contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for
consideration. In evaluating whether it has the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Company assesses whether they have the right to
direct the use of the identified asset and to obtain substantially all of the economic benefit from the use of the identified asset.

Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset during the lease term and lease liabilities represent the
Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease
payments over the lease term. Most leases include one or more options to renew. The exercise of the renewal option is at the Company’s sole
discretion and the Company includes these options in determining the lease term used to establish its right-of-use assets and lease liabilities when it
is reasonably certain the Company will exercise its option.


-----

Because most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information
available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The Company uses the implicit rate when readily
determinable. Operating lease expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

The Company has agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for as a single lease component. Leases with a lease term
of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. The Company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the
lease term. Variable lease payment amounts that cannot be determined at the commencement of the lease, such as increases in lease payments based
on changes in index rates, are not included in the right-of-use assets or liabilities. These variable lease payments are expensed as incurred.

The Company on a periodic basis evaluates events or changes in circumstances, such as lease abandonment, that would reduce the future cash flows
associated with a ROU asset. In the event of lease abandonment, in which the Company commits to no longer use the underlying property subject to
a lease for any business purposes, including storage, and does not have the intent or the ability to sublease the property, a loss on abandonment is
recognized within restructuring and other costs.

**_Goodwill and Intangible Assets_**

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and more frequently if impairment
indicators arise, which requires significant judgment. Impairment indicators include events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than
not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit with assigned goodwill below its carrying amount. The Company monitors events and changes in
circumstances on a continuous basis between annual impairment testing dates to determine if any events or changes in circumstances indicate
impairment. Separate intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives or over the period in which
economic benefit is received. The Company’s finite-lived intangibles consist of customer relationships, acquired backlog, trade names, trademarks,
patient communities, and acquired technologies. All finite-lived intangibles, excluding acquired backlog, are amortized on a straight-line basis over
the estimated useful life of the asset. Acquired backlog is amortized on an accelerated basis, which coincides with the period of economic benefit
received by the Company.

The goodwill impairment test involves comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit, including goodwill, to its carrying value using a
qualitative or quantitative analysis. If the qualitative analysis indicates that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value is less than the
carrying value for the reporting unit, the Company will perform a quantitative analysis of the reporting unit. If based on the qualitative analysis it is
more likely than not that the reporting unit’s estimated fair value exceeds its carrying value, no further analysis is required. If after performing the
quantitative analysis it is more likely than not that the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, a non-cash goodwill
impairment loss must be recognized in an amount equal to that excess for that reporting unit, not to exceed the total goodwill amount for that
reporting unit.

The fair value of a reporting unit could be negatively impacted by future events and circumstances. Such events or circumstances include a future
decline in the Company’s results of operations, a decline in the valuation of biopharmaceutical company stocks, an increase in weighted-average
cost of capital, a significant slowdown in the worldwide economy, failure to meet the performance projections included in the Company’s forecasts
of future operating results, loss of key customers, and a reduction in research and development (“R&D”) spending or outsourcing by
biopharmaceutical companies, among other events and circumstances.

When performing the quantitative analysis, the Company estimates the fair value of each reporting unit using the income approach. This approach
incorporates a discounted cash flow model in which the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit are discounted using a risk-adjusted
weighted-average cost of capital. The forecasts used in the discounted cash flow model for each reporting unit are based in part on strategic plans and
represent the Company’s estimates based on current and forecasted business and market conditions. The determination of fair value for each
reporting unit requires significant judgments and estimates and actual results could be materially different than those judgments and estimates, which
may result in a non-cash impairment charge. The Company completed an annual impairment test as of October 1, 2022 for all four of its reporting
units, and concluded that there were no impairments. The Company performed a quantitative analysis for its Communications reporting unit, which
had a goodwill balance of $529.1 million as of December 31, 2022. The Company concluded that the estimated fair value of its Communications
reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately $19.0 million, or 3%, and therefore no impairment existed.

The Company reviews intangible assets at the end of each reporting period to determine if facts and circumstances indicate that the useful life is
shorter than originally estimated or that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. If such facts and circumstances exist, the
Company assesses the recoverability of identified assets by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows associated with the related asset or
group of assets to their respective carrying amounts. Impairments, if any, are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those
assets and occur in the period in which the impairment determination is made.

The weighted average estimated useful lives of the Company’s intangible assets were as follows as of December 31:

**2022** **2021**
Customer relationships 9.8 years 9.8 years
Acquired backlog 2.6 years 2.6 years
Trade names and trademarks 5.5 years 5.5 years
Patient communities 6.0 years 6.0 years
Acquired technologies 5.8 years 6.0 years

No intangible asset impairment charges were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2022 or 2021. For additional information regarding the
carrying values of intangible assets, see “Note 2 – Financial Statement Details.”


-----

**_Contingencies_**

In the normal course of business, the Company periodically becomes involved in various proceedings and claims, including investigations,
disputes, litigations, and regulatory matters that are incidental to its business. The Company evaluates the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome
of all legal and regulatory matters and records accruals for probable loss contingencies for which the amount of the loss can be reasonably
estimated. Gain contingencies are not recognized until realized. Legal fees are expensed as incurred.

Because these matters are inherently unpredictable, and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur, assessing contingencies is highly
subjective and requires judgments about future events. These judgments and estimates are based, among other factors, on the status of the
proceedings, the merits of the Company’s defenses, and the consultation with in-house and external counsel. The Company regularly reviews
contingencies to determine whether its accruals and related disclosures are adequate. Although the Company believes that it has substantial defenses
in these matters, the amount of losses incurred as a result of actual outcomes may differ significantly from the Company’s estimates.

**_Revenue Recognition_**

In accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers and all related amendments (“ASC 606”), revenue is recognized when,
or as, a customer obtains control of promised services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to
be entitled to receive in exchange for these services.

A performance obligation is a promise (or a combination of promises) in a contract to transfer distinct goods or services to a customer and is the unit
of accounting under ASC 606 for the purposes of revenue recognition. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation and
is recognized as revenue, when, or as, each performance obligation is satisfied. The majority of the Company’s Clinical Solutions segment contracts
have a single performance obligation because the promise to transfer individual services is not separately identifiable from other promises in the
contracts, and therefore, is not distinct. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the contract’s transaction price is allocated to each
performance obligation using the best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract.

The majority of the Company’s revenue arrangements are service contracts that range in duration from a few months to several years. Substantially
all of the Company’s performance obligations, and associated revenue, are transferred to the customer over time. The Company generally receives
compensation based on measuring progress toward completion using anticipated project budgets for direct labor and prices for each service offering.
The Company is also reimbursed for certain third-party pass-through and out-of-pocket costs. In addition, in certain instances a customer contract
may include forms of variable consideration such as incentive fees, volume rebates or other provisions that can increase or decrease the transaction
price. This variable consideration is generally awarded upon achievement of certain performance metrics, program milestones or cost targets. For the
purposes of revenue recognition, variable consideration is assessed on a contract-by-contract basis and the amount included in the transaction price is
estimated based on the Company’s anticipated performance and consideration of all information that is reasonably available. Variable consideration
is recognized as revenue if and when it is deemed probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur
when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved in the future.

Most of the Company’s contracts can be terminated by the customer without cause with a notice period that generally ranges from 30 to 90 days. In
the event of termination, the Company’s contracts generally provide that the customer pay the Company for: (i) fees earned through the termination
date; (ii) fees and expenses for winding down the project, which include both fees incurred and actual expenses; (iii) non-cancellable expenditures;
and (iv) in some cases, a fee to cover a portion of the remaining professional fees on the project. The Company’s long-term clinical trial contracts
contain implied substantive termination penalties because of the significant wind-down cost of terminating a clinical trial. These provisions for
termination penalties result in these types of contracts being treated as long-term for revenue recognition purposes.

Changes in the scope of work are common, especially under long-term contracts, and generally result in a change in the total contract transaction
price. If the customer does not agree to a contract modification, the Company could bear the risk of cost overruns. Most of the Company’s contract
modifications are for services that are not distinct from the services under the existing contract due to the significant integration service provided in
the context of the contract and therefore result in a cumulative catch-up adjustment to revenue at the date of contract modification.

_Capitalized Costs_

The Company capitalizes certain costs associated with commissions and bonuses paid to its employees in the Clinical Solutions segment because
these costs are incurred in obtaining contracts that have a term greater than one year. Capitalized costs are included in prepaid expenses and other
current assets and other long-term assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company amortizes these costs in a manner that is
consistent with the pattern of revenue recognition described below. The Company expenses costs to obtain contracts that have a term of less than
one year.

_Clinical Solutions_

The Company’s Clinical Solutions segment provides solutions to address the clinical development needs of customers. The Company provides total
biopharmaceutical program development through its full-service platform, while also providing discrete services for any part of a clinical trial,
primarily through functional service provider, Early Stage, and Real World and Late Phase (“RWLP”) services. The services provided via the fullservice platform and RWLP platforms generally span several years and a significant benefit to the customer is provided by integrating the services
provided by the Company’s employees as well as those performed by third parties. Because the Company’s full-service platform provides a
significant integration service to the customer, these contracts contain a single performance obligation. Revenue is recognized over time using an
input measure of progress. The input measure reflects costs (including investigator payments and pass-through costs) incurred to date relative to total


-----

estimated costs to complete (“cost-to-cost measure of progress”). Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress methodology, revenue is recorded
proportionally to costs incurred. Contract costs principally include direct labor, investigator payments, and pass-through costs. The estimate of total
estimated costs at completion requires significant judgment. Contract estimates are based on various assumptions to project future outcomes of
events that often span several years. These estimates are reviewed periodically and any adjustments are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis in
the period they become known.

The remaining service offerings within the Clinical Solutions segment are generally short-term, month-to-month contracts, time and materials basis
contracts, or provide a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer (“series”). As
such, revenue for these service offerings is generally recognized as services are performed for the amount the Company estimates it is entitled to for
the period.

_Commercial Solutions_

The Company’s Commercial Solutions segment provides a broad suite of complementary commercialization services including Deployment
Solutions, communications (advertising and public relations), and consulting services. Deployment Solutions contracts offer outsourced services to
promote commercial products on behalf of a customer.

The remaining Commercial Solutions contracts are generally short-term, month-to-month contracts or time and materials contracts. As such,
Commercial Solutions revenue is generally recognized as services are performed for the amount of consideration the Company estimates it is entitled
to for the period. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time based on the proportion of labor costs expended to total
labor costs expected to complete the contract.

**_Accounts Receivable, Unbilled Services, and Deferred Revenue_**

Accounts receivable are recorded at net realizable value. Unbilled accounts receivable arise when services have been rendered for which revenue
has been recognized but the customers have not been billed. Contractual provisions and payment schedules may or may not correspond to the
timing of the performance of services under the contract.

Unbilled services include contract assets, under which the right to bill the customer is subject to factors other than the passage of time.
These amounts may not exceed their net realizable value. Contract assets are generally classified as current.

Deferred revenue is a contract liability that consists of customer payments received in advance of performance and billings in excess of revenue
recognized, net of revenue recognized from the balance at the beginning of the period.

_Timing of Billing and Performance_

Differences in the timing of revenue recognition and associated billings and cash collections result in recording of billed accounts receivable,
unbilled accounts receivable (including contract assets), and deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet. Amounts are billed as work
progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms either at periodic intervals or upon achievement of contractual milestones. Billings
generally occur subsequent to revenue recognition, resulting in recording unbilled accounts receivable in instances where the right to bill is
contingent solely on the passage of time (e.g., in the following month), and contract assets in instances where the right to bill is associated with
achievement of a milestone.

**_Reimbursable Out-of-Pocket Expenses_**

The Company incurs and is reimbursed by its customers for certain costs, including fees paid to principal investigators and for other out-of-pocket
costs (such as travel expenses for the Company’s clinical monitors and sales representatives). The Company includes these costs in total operating
expenses, and the related reimbursements in revenue, as the Company is the principal in the applicable arrangements and is responsible for fulfilling
the promise to provide the specified services.

**_Share-Based Compensation_**

The Company measures and recognizes compensation expense related to all share-based awards based on the estimated fair value of the awards.
The fair value of restricted stock and stock unit awards is measured on the grant date based on the fair market value of the Company’s common
stock.

Share-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the requisite service period or the vesting term. For
awards with performance conditions, stock-based compensation expense is recognized when the achievement of each individual performance target
becomes probable, and the number of shares expected to vest is adjusted for the weighted probability of attainment of the relevant performance
targets. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.

All excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies (including tax benefits of dividends on share-based payment awards, if applicable) are recognized as
income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statements of income. The tax effects of exercised or vested awards are treated as discrete items in
the reporting period in which they occur. The Company also recognizes excess tax benefits regardless of whether the benefit reduces taxes payable in
the current period.

**_Income Taxes_**


-----

The majority of the Company’s U.S. subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return, while certain U.S. subsidiaries, including
recently acquired entities, may file separate U.S. federal tax returns. The Company’s subsidiaries in international jurisdictions file tax returns in
their respective jurisdictions.

The Company estimates its tax liability based on current tax laws in the statutory jurisdictions in which it operates. Accordingly, the impact of
changes in income tax laws on deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities is recognized in earnings in the period during which such changes are
enacted. The Company records deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and tax basis
of the Company’s assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the differences are realized or settled.

Deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise
because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax
credit carryforwards. The Company evaluates recoverability of these future tax deductions. The Company establishes a valuation allowance for
deferred income tax assets when the Company believes it is more likely than not the assets will not be realized. The Company evaluates the
recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing future expected taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, the Company
considers both positive and negative evidence, such as historical and forecasted results of operations, and implementation of prudent and feasible
tax planning strategies. If the objectively verifiable negative evidence outweighs any available positive evidence (or the only available positive is
subjective and cannot be verified), then a valuation allowance will likely be deemed necessary. If a valuation allowance is deemed to be
unnecessary, such allowance is released and any related benefit is recognized in the period of the change.

The Company recognizes a tax benefit from any uncertain tax positions only if they are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination
based on the technical merits of the position. The Company evaluates uncertain tax positions pursuant to the more likely than not standard, and
benefits related to such uncertain tax positions are recognized as the largest amount of benefit, determined on a cumulative probability basis, to be
realized upon ultimate settlement of the position. Components of the reserve for uncertain tax positions are classified as either a current or a longterm liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets based on management’s expectation of future cash settlements.

Judgment is required in determining what constitutes an uncertain tax position, as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position. The
Company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating tax positions and tax benefits. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities
involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in domestic and foreign jurisdictions. If the calculation of the
liability related to uncertain tax positions proves to be more or less than the ultimate settlement, a tax expense or tax benefit, respectively, would
result. Unrecognized tax benefits are presented as either a reduction to a deferred tax asset or as a separate liability.

**_Restructuring and Other Costs_**

Restructuring and other costs primarily consist of one-time employee termination benefits, contract termination costs, and other costs associated with
an exit or disposal activity. The Company accounts for restructuring costs in accordance with ASC Topic 420, Exit or Disposal _Cost Obligations._
This guidance requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized in the period in which the liability is
incurred, as opposed to the period in which management commits to a plan of action for termination. The guidance also requires that the liabilities
associated with an exit or disposal activity be measured at the fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred, except for: (i) liabilities
related to one-time employee termination benefits, which shall be measured and recognized at the date the entity notifies employees of termination,
unless employees are required to render services beyond a minimum retention period, in which case the liability is recognized ratably over the future
service period; and (ii) liabilities related to an operating lease, which shall be measured and recognized when the contract does not have any future
economic benefit to the entity (i.e., the entity ceases to utilize the rights conveyed by the contract). Restructuring liabilities are included in accrued
expenses and other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

**_Earnings Per Share_**

The Company determines earnings per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share. The Company has one class of common stock
for purposes of the earnings per share calculation and therefore computes basic earnings per share by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding for the applicable period. Diluted earnings per share are computed in the same manner as basic
earnings per share, except that the number of shares is increased to assume exercise of potentially dilutive equity awards using the treasury stock
method, unless the effect of such increase would be anti-dilutive. Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising
equity awards and the amount of compensation cost for future service that the Company has not yet recognized are assumed to be used to repurchase
shares.

**_Subsequent Events_**

The Company considers events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued to provide
additional evidence relative to certain estimates or to identify matters that require additional disclosure. The Company evaluated all events and
transactions through the date that these financial statements were issued.

**_Recently Adopted Accounting Standards_**

In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2016-13 (“ASU 2016-13”), Financial Instruments - Credit
_Losses (Topic 326) to modify the impairment model to utilize an expected loss methodology in place of the previous incurred loss_ methodology and
require consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The Company adopted ASU


-----

2016-13 on January 1, 2020, and recorded the impact of the adoption through a cumulative-effect adjustment to accumulated deficit. Adoption of
the new standard resulted in the recording of additional allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately $2.8 million as of January 1, 2020.

**_Credit Agreement_**

On November 4, 2022, the Company entered into an Amended & Restated Credit Agreement (“A&R Credit Agreement”) that extended and
refinanced the Company’s existing credit agreement, dated August 1, 2017, among the Company, the lenders party thereto, JPMorgan, as
Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent, and each of the other parties thereto (“Credit Agreement”) that previously included a $1.55 billion Term
Loan A facility (“Term Loan A”) and a $600.0 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolver”). The A&R Credit Agreement matures in November
2027 and now includes a $1.35 billion term loan A facility (“Term A Facility”) and an increase to the Revolver of $400.0 million to $1.00 billion.
The full Term A Facility and $261.0 million on the Revolver was drawn at closing to pay off Term Loan A. In connection with this payoff and
earlier prepayments, the Company recorded a $0.8 million loss on extinguishment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2022. The Term A
Facility was issued net of a discount and debt issuance costs totaling $2.3 million. As of December 31, 2022, the interest rate on the Term A Facility
was 5.67%.

All obligations under the A&R Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company and certain of the Company’s direct and indirect wholly-owned
domestic subsidiaries. The obligations under the A&R Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and the
guarantors, including 65% of the capital stock of certain controlled foreign subsidiaries.

Term A Facility borrowings bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus an applicable rate or Adjusted Term SOFR Rate
plus an applicable rate, subject to a pricing grid based on the first lien leverage ratio. Revolver borrowings in U.S. Dollars bear interest at a rate per
annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus an applicable rate, Adjusted Term SOFR Rate plus an applicable rate or Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR
Rate plus an applicable rate, each also subject to a pricing grid based on the first lien leverage ratio. Revolver borrowings in Canadian Dollars,
Sterling, Euro, Japanese Yen, and Singapore Dollars bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Term Benchmark, Credit Balance
Refund (“CBR”) or Risk Free Rate (“RFR”) (each as defined in the A&R Credit Agreement), as applicable, plus an applicable rate, in each case,
also subject to a pricing grid based on the first lien leverage ratio.

The A&R Credit Agreement provides that the Company will make scheduled quarterly payments on the Term A Facility equal to 0% of the
original principal amount of the Term A Facility through January 2024, 0.625% in April 2024 and July 2024, and 1.25% in October 2024 and
quarterly thereafter, with the remaining balance payable on maturity date.

The applicable margins with respect to Alternate Base Rate and Adjusted RFR/CBR/Term Benchmark borrowings are determined depending on the
“First Lien Leverage Ratio” or the “Secured Net Leverage Ratio” (as defined in the A&R Credit Agreement) and range as follows:

**Alternate** **Adjusted RFR/CBR/Term**
**Base Rate** **Benchmark Rate**
Term A Facility 0.25% - 0.50% 1.25% - 1.50%
Revolver 0.25% - 0.50% 1.25% - 1.50%


-----

The Company also pays a quarterly commitment fee between 0.20% and 0.30% on the average daily unused balance of the Revolver
depending on the “First Lien Leverage Ratio” at the adjustment date.

**_Revolver and Letters of Credit_**

The Revolver includes letters of credit (“LOCs”) with a sublimit of $150.0 million. Fees are charged on all outstanding LOCs at an annual rate equal
to the margin in effect on Adjusted RFR/CBR/Term Benchmark Rate revolving loans plus participation and fronting fees. As of December 31, 2022,
there were $121.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Revolver and $14.1 million of LOCs outstanding, leaving $864.9 million of available
borrowings under the Revolver, including $135.9 million available for LOCs. As of December 31, 2022, the interest rate on the Revolver was
5.65%.

**_Accounts Receivable Financing Agreement_**

Under the Company’s accounts receivable financing agreement (the “Receivables Financing Agreement”), certain of the Company’s consolidated
subsidiaries sell accounts receivable and unbilled services (including contract assets) balances to a wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote special
purpose entity (“SPE”), which is the borrower under the facility. The facility is without recourse to the Company or any subsidiaries of the
Company other than the SPE, other than with respect to limited indemnity obligations of the selling entities and the servicer of the receivables in
respect of the character of the receivables sold by them and the performance of the servicing duties.

On October 3, 2022, the Company amended its Receivables Financing Agreement to increase the amount it can borrow from $400.0 million to
$550.0 million, extended the maturity to October 2025, and drew down the additional $150.0 million. At the same time, the Company made
voluntary prepayments on its Term Loan A totaling $150.0 million; therefore, there was no incremental impact on the Company’s debt balance.

As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $550.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Receivables Financing Agreement, which are
recorded in long-term debt on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. There was no remaining borrowing capacity available under this
agreement as of December 31, 2022.

The Receivables Financing Agreement is secured by a lien on certain receivables and other assets, and the Company has guaranteed the performance
of the obligations of existing and future subsidiaries that sell and service the accounts receivable under this agreement. The available borrowing
capacity varies monthly according to the levels of the Company’s eligible accounts receivable and unbilled receivables. Loans under this agreement
will accrue interest at an annual rate equal to the Adjusted SOFR Rate plus an applicable margin, subject to a pricing grid based on the Company’s
first lien leverage ratio. The Adjusted SOFR rate is equal to the Daily Simple SOFR Rate or the Term SOFR Rate (each as defined in the Receivables
Financing Agreement), as applicable, for the applicable interest period plus 0.10% subject to a floor of 0%. As of December 31, 2022, the interest
rate on the accounts receivable financing agreement was 5.32%.

**_The Notes_**

On November 24, 2020, the Company completed the issuance and sale of the Notes, with an aggregate principal amount of $600.0 million, which
bears interest at a rate of 3.625% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears beginning on July 15, 2021, and matures on January 15, 2029. The
Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture (the “Indenture”), which provides, among other things, that the Notes are senior unsecured obligations
of the Company and are guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis, by certain of the Company’s subsidiaries.

The Company may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time prior to January 15, 2024 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the aggregate
principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed plus a “make-whole” premium and accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, prior to July 15, 2023, the
Company may redeem up to 40% of the original principal amount of the Notes with proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal
to 103.625% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. On or after January 15, 2024, the Company may
redeem some or all of the Notes at the redemption prices set forth in the Indenture plus accrued and unpaid interest.

The Indenture contains covenants that limit the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to, among other things, (1) incur
additional liens, (2) engage in certain sale and leaseback transactions, and (3) conduct mergers, consolidations, or asset sales. These
covenants are subject to exceptions and qualifications set forth in the Indenture.

If the Company sells certain of its assets or experience specific kinds of changes of control, the Company is required to offer to repurchase the
Notes at a repurchase price equal to (1) par plus any accrued and unpaid interest in the case of an asset sale or (2) 101% of the aggregate principal
amount thereof plus any accrued and unpaid interest in the case of a change of control.

**_Maturities of Debt Obligations_**

As of December 31, 2022, the contractual maturities of the Company’s debt obligations (excluding finance leases that are presented in “Note 19 –
Leases”) were as follows (in thousands):

**Principal** **Interest (a)**
2023 $ — $ 135,976
2024 33,750 135,471
2025 617,500 124,545
2026 67,500 98,379

2028 and thereafter 600,000 22,656
Less: Term loan original issuance discount (3,322)
Less: Unamortized deferred issuance costs (6,505)

Total $ 2,611,166 $ 599,922

(a) The interest payments on long-term debt in the above table are based on interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2022.

**5. Derivatives**

**_Interest Rate Swaps_**

The Company has entered into various interest rate swaps to mitigate its exposure to changes in interest rates on its term loan. In June 2018, the
Company entered into an interest rate swap with multiple counterparties that had an initial aggregate notional value of $1.01 billion, an effective date
of December 31, 2018, and expired on June 30, 2021.

In March 2020, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with multiple counterparties. The interest rate swaps had an initial aggregate
notional value of $549.2 million that increased to $1.42 billion on June 30, 2021, an effective date of March 31, 2020, and will expire on March
31, 2023. As of December 31, 2022, the notional value of this interest rate swap was $1.03 billion.

The significant terms of these derivatives are substantially the same as those contained within the A&R Credit Agreement, including monthly
settlements with the swap counterparties. Interest rate swaps are designated as hedging instruments. The amounts of hedge ineffectiveness recorded
in net income during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 were insignificant.

**_Foreign Exchange Forward_**

On October 30, 2020, the Company entered into a foreign exchange forward in order to minimize monthly foreign currency remeasurement gains or
losses on non-functional currency monetary balances. The foreign exchange forward notional value may be adjusted each month as the exposure
balance changes. The Company did not designate the derivative as a hedge. All changes in the fair value of the foreign exchange forward are
recorded in earnings every month to other expense (income), net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. The Company recognized
$10.0 million and $0.7 million of realized losses during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, related to this foreign exchange
forward. As of December 31, 2022, the notional value was zero as the Company discontinued the use of this foreign exchange forward during the
year ended December 31, 2022.

**_Fair Values_**

The fair values of the Company’s derivative financial instruments as of December 31 and the line items on the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets to which they were recorded were as follows (in thousands):

**Balance Sheet Classification** **2022** **2021**
Interest rate swaps - current Prepaid expenses and other current assets $ 10,073 $ —
Interest rate swaps - non-current Other long-term assets — 948
Fair value of derivative assets $ 10,073 $ 948

Interest rate swaps - current Accrued expenses $ — $ 1,827
Fair value of derivative liabilities $ — $ 1,827

**6. Fair Value Measurements**

**_Assets and Liabilities Carried at Fair Value_**

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company’s financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value included cash and cash equivalents,
restricted cash, trading securities, accounts receivable, unbilled services (including contract assets), accounts payable, accrued expenses, deferred
revenue, contingent obligations, liabilities under the accounts receivable financing agreement, and derivative instruments.

The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, unbilled services (including contract assets), accounts payable,
accrued expenses, deferred revenue, and the liabilities under the accounts receivable financing agreement approximate their respective carrying
amounts because of the liquidity and short-term nature of these financial instruments.

**_Financial Instruments Subject to Recurring Fair Value Measurements_**

As of December 31, 2022, the fair values of the major classes of the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis

(a) Represents the fair value of investments in mutual funds based on quoted market prices that are used to fund the liability associated with the
Company’s deferred compensation plan.

(b) The Company has committed to invest $21.5 million as a limited partner in two private equity funds. The private equity funds invest in
opportunities in the healthcare and life sciences industry. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s remaining unfunded commitment in the private
equity funds was $7.1 million. The Company holds minor ownership interests (less than 3%) in each of the private equity funds and has determined
that it does not exercise significant influence over the private equity funds’ operating or finance activities. As the private equity funds do not have
readily determinable fair values, the Company has estimated the fair values using each fund’s Net Asset Value, the amount by which the value of all
assets exceeds all debt and liabilities, in accordance with ASC Topic 946, Financial Services – Investment Companies.

(c) Represents the fair value of interest rate swap arrangements (see “Note 5 – Derivatives” for further information).

(d) Represents the fair value of contingent consideration obligations related to acquisitions. The fair values of these liabilities are determined based
on the Company’s best estimate of the probable timing and amount of settlement.

The following table presents a reconciliation of changes in the carrying amount of contingent obligations classified as Level 3 for the years ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands):

(a) Represents obligations in connection with the acquisition of RxDataScience and insignificant acquisitions completed during 2021.

(b) The Company made payments to fully settle the contingent tax-sharing obligation arising from inVentiv Health, Inc.’s 2016 merger with
Double Eagle Parent, Inc. (see “Note 16 – Commitments and Contingencies” for further information) and obligations in connection with an
insignificant acquisition completed during 2021.

(c) Represents obligations in connection with an insignificant acquisition completed during 2022.

(d) The Company made payments to fully settle the obligations in connection with an insignificant acquisition completed during 2021.

During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no transfers of assets or liabilities between Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 fair value
measurements.

**_Financial Instruments Subject to Non-Recurring Fair Value Measurements_**

Certain assets, including goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, are carried on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at cost and,
subsequent to initial recognition, are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis when certain identified events or changes in circumstances that
may have a significant adverse effect on the carrying values of these assets occur. These assets are classified as Level 3 fair value measurements
within the fair value hierarchy. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a
triggering event has occurred. Intangible assets are tested for impairment upon the occurrence of certain triggering events. As of December 31, 2022
and 2021, assets carried on the consolidated balance sheets and not remeasured to fair value on a recurring basis totaled $5.59 billion and $5.83
billion, respectively.

**_Fair Value Disclosures for Financial Instruments Not Carried at Fair Value_**

The estimated fair values of the term loan and the Notes are determined based on the price that the Company would have had to pay to settle
the liabilities. As these liabilities are not actively traded, they are classified as Level 2 fair value measurements. The estimated fair values of the
Company’s term loan and the Notes were as follows (in thousands):

**December 31, 2022** **December 31, 2021**
**Carrying** **Estimated** **Carrying** **Estimated**
**Value (a)** **Fair Value** **Value (a)** **Fair Value**
Term A Facility due November 2027 $ 1,346,678 $ 1,329,750 $ — $          —

(a) The carrying value of the term loan debt is shown net of original issue discounts.

**7. Restructuring and Other Costs**

During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred employee severance and benefit costs, facility and lease termination costs, and
other costs related to its restructuring activities. The costs incurred were primarily related to the Company’s margin enhancement initiatives and
specific actions focused on streamlining the operations of its Clinical Solutions segment to optimize efficiency and enhance the delivery of customer
projects. The Company expects to continue to incur costs related to its business transformation initiatives, including the potential outsourcing of
certain administrative functions during 2023 and beyond as the Company continues the ongoing evaluations of its global workforce and facilities
infrastructure needs to improve customer engagement, increase innovation, and achieve operating efficiencies.

**_Stock Repurchase Programs_**

On February 26, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) authorized the repurchase of up to an aggregate of $250.0 million of the
Company’s common stock to be executed from time to time in open market transactions effected through a broker at prevailing market prices, in
block trades, or through privately negotiated transactions through December 31, 2019 (the “2018 Stock Repurchase Program”). On December 5,
2019, the Board increased the dollar amount authorized under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program to up to an aggregate of $300.0 million and
extended the term of the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program to December 31, 2020. The 2018 Stock Repurchase Program expired on December 31,
2020.

On November 17, 2020, the Company’s Board authorized the repurchase of up to an aggregate of $300.0 million of the Company’s Class A
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, to be executed from time to time in open market transactions effected through a broker at prevailing
market prices, in block trades, or through privately negotiated transactions through December 31, 2022 (the “2021 Stock Repurchase Program”).
The 2021 Stock Repurchase Program took effect on January 1, 2021.

On May 25, 2022, the Board approved a new stock repurchase program (the “2022 Stock Repurchase Program”) that took effect immediately and
replaced the 2021 Stock Repurchase Program. The 2022 Stock Repurchase Program authorizes the Company to repurchase up to $350.0 million of
the Company’s Class A common stock, par value $0.01, and will expire on December 31, 2024.

The 2022 Stock Repurchase Program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any particular amount of the Company’s common stock, and may
be modified, extended, suspended, or discontinued at any time. The timing and amount of repurchases are determined by the Company’s
management based on a variety of factors such as the market price of the Company’s common stock, the Company’s corporate cash requirements,
and overall market conditions. The 2022 Stock Repurchase Program is subject to applicable legal requirements, including federal and state securities
laws and applicable Nasdaq rules. The Company may also repurchase shares of its common stock pursuant to a trading plan meeting the
requirements of Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which would permit shares of the Company’s common stock
to be repurchased when the Company might otherwise be precluded from doing so by law.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased 1,928,923 shares of its Class A common stock for a total purchase price of $150.0
million under the 2021 Stock Repurchase Program. No shares were repurchased under the 2022 Stock Repurchase Program. The Company
immediately retired all of the repurchased common stock and charged the par value of the shares to common stock. The excess of the repurchase
price over the par value was applied on a pro rata basis against additional paid-in capital, with the remainder applied to accumulated deficit.

The following table sets forth repurchase activity under the Company’s stock repurchase programs from inception through December 31, 2022:

Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote on all matters to be voted on by the shareholders of the Company, including the election
of directors. Each share of Class B common stock is entitled to one vote on all matters to be voted on by the shareholders of the Company, except
for the right to vote in the election of directors. Additionally, each share of Class B common stock is convertible (on a one-for-one basis) into Class
A common stock at any time at the election of the holder.

**_Dividend Rights and Preferences of Common Stock_**

The holders of Class A and Class B common stock are entitled to dividends on a pro rata basis at such time and in such amounts as
declared by the Board. There were no dividends paid during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, or 2020.

**_Liquidation Rights and Preferences of Common Stock_**

The holders of Class A and Class B common stock are entitled to participate on a pro rata basis in all distributions made in connection with a

**9. Earnings Per Share**

The following table provides a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted earnings per share computations (in
thousands, except per share data):


-----

**Year Ended December 31,**
**2022** **2021** **2020**
**Numerator:**

Net income $ 266,497 $ 234,831 $ 192,787
**Denominator:**

Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 102,974 103,872 104,168
Effect of dilutive securities:

Stock options and other awards under deferred share-based compensation

programs 503 1,193 1,297
Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 103,477 105,065 105,465
**Earnings per share:**

Basic $ 2.59 $ 2.26 $ 1.85
Diluted $ 2.58 $ 2.24 $ 1.83

Potential common shares outstanding that are considered anti-dilutive are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share. Potential
common shares related to stock options and other awards under share-based compensation programs may be determined to be anti-dilutive based
on the application of the treasury stock method. Potential common shares are also anti-dilutive in periods when the Company incurs a net loss.

The number of potential shares outstanding that were anti-dilutive and therefore excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share,
weighted for the portion of the period they were outstanding, were 828,023, 145,342, and 582,760 for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and
2020, respectively.

**10. Income Taxes**

The components of income before provision for income taxes were as follows (in thousands):

Deferred (1,747) 5,012 (10,922)
Income tax expense $ 48,068 $ 80,329 $ 10,871

**_Foreign Earnings_**

The Company has approximately $753.1 million of undistributed foreign earnings, of which approximately $474.0 million will remain indefinitely
reinvested in the foreign jurisdictions. These earnings are expected to be used to support the growth and working capital needs of the Company’s
foreign subsidiaries. It is impracticable to determine the total amount of unrecognized deferred taxes with respect to these indefinitely reinvested
earnings. The remaining $279.1 million of undistributed foreign earnings are not considered indefinitely reinvested, and the Company has provided a
$4.6 million deferred tax liability, primarily related to the estimated withholding tax and state taxes that would be due upon repatriation.

**_BEAT_**

The Company’s base eroding payments do not exceed the three percent threshold of its deductible payments in 2022; therefore, the Company has
not recorded any base erosion and anti-abuse minimum tax (“BEAT”) liability for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020.

Actual income tax expense differed from the amount computed by applying the U.S. federal tax rate of 21% to pre-tax income as a result of the

As of December 31, 2022, the valuation allowance increased by $1.6 million, resulting from a net increase of $5.9 million primarily due to
increasing domestic valuation allowances related to state deferred tax assets, offset by foreign currency exchange impacts.

As of December 31, 2021, the valuation allowance decreased by $2.3 million, resulting from a net decrease of $1.5 million primarily due to
releasing a domestic valuation allowance related to state deferred tax assets.

The income tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows as of
December 31 (in thousands):

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had U.S. federal net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards of approximately $28.6 million and
$317.4 million, respectively. These carryforwards begin to expire in 2029, but the Company anticipates utilizing such carryforwards prior to their
expirations.

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had state NOL carryforwards of approximately $717.8 million and $840.4 million, respectively,
a portion of which expire annually. The Company also had foreign NOL carryforwards of $122.0 million and $98.9 million as of December 31,
2022 and 2021, respectively. The majority of these carryforwards have indefinite carryforward periods, but valuation allowances have been
established for jurisdictions where the future benefits of the NOL carryforwards are not more likely than not to be realized.

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had Canadian R&D credit carryforwards of $54.6 million and $56.1 million, respectively.
These credit carryforwards have an indefinite life, but for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, valuation allowances of $54.6 million and
$56.1 million, respectively, have been established against these tax credits where the future benefits of the credits are not more likely than not to
be realized.

The Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits, exclusive of associated interest and penalties, were $16.8 million and $12.1 million as of
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase of $4.7 million was primarily due to increase in positions relating to prior years in both
domestic and foreign jurisdictions. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense
in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had accrued interest and penalties
related to uncertain tax positions of $2.5 million and $2.4 million, respectively.

The Company believes it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by approximately $1.9 million within the next 12
months as a result of lapses in statutes of limitations. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding
accrued interest and penalties, is as follows (in thousands):

**Unrecognized tax benefits balance as of December 31, 2019** $ 23,238
Increases for tax positions in the current year 254
Increases for tax positions of prior years 3,237

**Unrecognized tax benefits balance as of December 31, 2022** $ 16,784

Due to the geographic breadth of the Company’s operations, numerous tax audits may be ongoing throughout the world at any point in time. Income
tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional income taxes which will be due upon the conclusion of these audits. Estimates of these
income tax liabilities are made based upon prior experience and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances. However, due to the
uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities which could be
materially different from these estimates. In such an event, the Company will record additional income tax expense or benefit in the period in which
such resolution occurs.

The Company is not currently under any U.S. federal income tax audits, however, income tax returns are under examination by tax authorities in
several state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s federal and state tax filings are open to investigations in numerous years due to NOL
carryforwards. Additionally, the Company currently has an ongoing examination for tax years 2014 to 2020 in the United Kingdom (“UK”). The UK


-----

is the jurisdiction with the Company’s largest foreign operations. The Company believes that its reserve for uncertain tax positions is adequate to
cover existing risks or exposures related to all open tax years and jurisdictions.

**11. Revenue from Contracts with Customers**

**_Unsatisfied Performance Obligations_**

As of December 31, 2022, the total aggregate transaction price allocated to the unsatisfied performance obligations under contracts with contract
terms greater than one year and that are not accounted for as a series pursuant to ASC 606 was $5.96 billion. This amount includes revenue
associated with reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses. The Company expects to recognize revenue over the remaining contract term of the individual
projects, with contract terms generally ranging from one to five years. The amount of unsatisfied performance obligations is presented net of any
constraints and, as a result, is lower than the potential contractual revenue. The contracts excluded due to constraints include contracts that do not
commence within a certain period of time or that require the Company to undertake numerous activities to fulfill these performance obligations,
including various activities that are outside of the Company’s control.

**_Timing of Billing and Performance_**

During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized approximately $642.0 million of revenue that was included in the deferred
revenue balance at the beginning of the year. During the year ended December 31, 2022, there were reductions of approximately $20.2 million in
the Company’s revenue recognized related to performance obligations partially satisfied in previous periods. The gross and net amounts of revenue
recognized solely from changes in estimates were not material.

**12. Segment Information**

The Company is managed through two reportable segments: Clinical Solutions and Commercial Solutions. Each reportable segment consists of
multiple service offerings that, when combined, create a leading fully integrated biopharmaceutical solutions organization built to accelerate
customer success. We translate unique clinical, medical affairs and commercial insights into outcomes to address modern market realities. Clinical
Solutions offers comprehensive global services for the development of diagnostics, drugs, biologics, devices, and digital therapeutics that span Phase
I to IV of clinical development. The segment is organized around clinical pharmacology and bioanalytical services, workforce deployment, fullservice clinical studies, real world evidence, and consulting. This segment offers individual services including regulatory consulting, project
management, protocol development, investigational site recruitment, clinical monitoring, technology-enabled patient recruitment and engagement,
clinical home health services, clinical trial diversity, biometrics, and regulatory affairs; all across a comprehensive range of therapeutic areas.
Commercial Solutions provides the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and healthcare industries with commercialization services, including deployment
solutions, communications solutions (public relations, advertising, and medical communications), and consulting services.

The Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (the “CODM”) reviews segment performance and allocates resources based upon segment revenue
and income from operations. Inter-segment revenue is eliminated from the segment reporting provided to the CODM and is not included in the
segment revenue presented in the table below. Certain costs are not allocated to the Company’s reportable segments and are reported as general
corporate expenses. These costs primarily consist of share-based compensation, general operating expenses associated with the Board and the
Company’s senior leadership, finance, investor relations, and internal audit functions, and transaction and integration-related expenses. The Company
does not allocate depreciation, amortization, asset impairment charges, or restructuring and other costs to its segments. Prior period segment results
have been recast to conform to insignificant changes to management reporting in 2022. Additionally, the CODM reviews the Company’s assets on a
consolidated basis and does not allocate assets to its reportable segments for purposes of assessing segment performance or allocating resources.

**14. Concentration of Credit Risk**

Financial assets that subject the Company to credit risk primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and unbilled services
(including contract assets). The Company’s cash and cash equivalents consist principally of cash and are maintained at several financial
institutions with reputable credit ratings. The Company maintains cash depository accounts with several financial institutions worldwide and is
exposed to credit risk related to the potential inability to access liquidity in financial institutions where its cash and cash equivalents are
concentrated. The Company has not historically incurred any losses with respect to these balances and believes that they bear minimal credit risk.

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, substantially all of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents were held within the U.S.

Substantially all of the Company’s revenue is earned by performing services under contracts with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.
The concentration of credit risk is equal to the outstanding accounts receivable and unbilled services (including contract assets) balances less
deferred revenue.

No single customer accounted for greater than 10% of the Company’s revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020.

No single customer accounted for greater than 10% of the Company’s accounts receivable and unbilled services (including contract assets) balances
for the year ended December 31, 2022 or 2021.

**15. Related-Party Transactions**

For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company had combined revenue of $9.4 million from five customers whose board of directors each
included a member who was also a member of the Company’s Board. The combined revenue reflects the periods in which the member served on
both the customer’s board of directors and the Company’s Board. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had combined receivables of $1.3 million
from four customers whose board of directors each included a member who was also a member of the Company’s Board.


-----

On February 8, 2022, the Company completed an insignificant acquisition, which was associated with the 2021 acquisition of RxDataScience,
through an arm’s-length transaction. A member of the Company’s management was a minority shareholder of the acquired company.

For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company had combined revenue of $3.7 million from three customers whose board of directors each
included a member who was also a member of the Company’s Board. The combined revenue reflects the periods in which the member served on
both the customer’s board of directors and the Company’s Board. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had combined receivables of $0.6 million
from two customers whose board of directors each included a member who was also a member of the Company’s Board.

On October 6, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of RxDataScience through an arm’s-length transaction. A member of the Company’s
management was the co-founder and minority shareholder of RxDataScience and continued to be an executive advisor at RxDataScience up until
the acquisition date. For additional information, refer to “Note 3 – Acquisitions, Divestitures, and Investments” and “Note 6 – Fair Value
Measurements.”

For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had revenue of $1.8 million and, as of December 31, 2020, receivables of $1.3 million from a
customer whose board of directors included a member who was also a member of the Company’s Board. This customer became a related party
during the third quarter of 2020. During 2020, the Company sold its contingent staffing business to a related party in exchange for potential future
cash consideration not to exceed $4.0 million. Based on the financial results of the business through May 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company
recognized $2.2 million and $1.8 million of contingent consideration in other expense (income), net in the accompanying consolidated statements of
income during 2022 and 2021, respectively, which reflects the maximum amount of future cash consideration. For additional information, refer to
“Note 3 – Acquisitions, Divestitures, and Investments.”

**16. Commitments and Contingencies**

**_Legal Contingencies_**

The Company is involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company accrues a liability when a loss
is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a material loss contingency is reasonably possible but not probable, the
Company does not record a liability, but instead discloses the nature and the amount of the claim, and an estimate of the loss or range of loss, if such
an estimate can be made. Legal fees are expensed as incurred. In the opinion of management, the outcome of any existing claims and legal or
regulatory proceedings, other than the specific matters described below, if decided adversely, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

On December 1, 2017, the first of two virtually identical actions alleging federal securities law claims was filed against the Company and certain of
its officers on behalf of a putative class of its shareholders. The first action, captioned Bermudez v. INC Research, Inc., et al, No. 17-09457
(S.D.N.Y.), was filed in the Southern District of New York (the “Bermudez action”), and the second action, Vaitkuvienë v. Syneos Health, Inc., et
al, No. 18-0029 (E.D.N.C.), was filed on January 25, 2018 in the Eastern District of North Carolina (the “Vaitkuvienë action”). On March 30, 2018,
the Bermudez action was dismissed voluntarily. After the San Antonio Fire & Police Pension Fund and El Paso Firemen
& Policemen’s Pension Fund were appointed as Lead Plaintiffs in the Vaitkuvienë action, Lead Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on July 30,
2018, which named as defendants the Company, Alistair Macdonald, Gregory S. Rush, Michael A. Bell, and each member of the Company’s Board
at the time of the stockholder vote on the 2017 merger (the “Merger”) of INC Research with an affiliate of inVentiv Health, Inc. (“inVentiv”). The
amended complaint alleged claims under Sections 10(b), 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of a putative class of
purchasers of the Company’s common stock between May 10, 2017 and November 8, 2017, contending that the Company published inaccurate or
incomplete information regarding, among other things, the financial performance and business outlook for inVentiv’s business prior to and following
the Merger. Lead Plaintiffs seek, among other things, orders (i) declaring that the lawsuit is a proper class action and (ii) awarding compensatory
damages in an amount to be proven at trial, including interest thereon, and reasonable costs and expenses incurred in this action, including attorneys’
fees and expert fees, to Lead Plaintiffs and other class members. On September 20, 2018, Defendants moved to dismiss the action. On August 30,
2021, the District Court entered an order granting the motion to dismiss in its entirety, and on October 21, 2021, the Court entered judgment for
Defendants. On November 19, 2021, Lead Plaintiffs appealed from this judgment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which appeal
remains pending.

The Company is presently unable to predict the duration, scope, or result of the foregoing putative class actions, or any other related lawsuit. As
such, the Company is presently unable to develop a reasonable estimate of a possible loss or range of losses, if any, related to these matters. While
the Company intends to defend any further proceedings in the putative class action litigation vigorously, the outcome of such litigation or any other
litigation is necessarily uncertain. The Company could be forced to expend significant resources in the defense of these lawsuits or future ones, and it
may not prevail. As such, these matters could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, annual, or interim results of operations, cash
flows, or its financial condition.

**_Assumed Contingent Tax-Sharing Obligation_**

As a result of the Merger, the Company assumed contingent tax-sharing obligations arising from inVentiv Health, Inc.’s 2016 merger with
Double Eagle Parent, Inc. During 2021, the Company made payments of $6.2 million to fully settle this outstanding obligation. As of December
31, 2020, the estimated fair value of the assumed contingent tax-sharing obligations was $6.8 million.


-----

**_Contingent Earn-out Liabilities_**

In connection with the RxDataScience acquisition, the Company recorded a contingent earn-out liability to be paid based on achievement of
revenue targets in 2022 and the renewal of a specific customer contract. The estimated fair value of the contingent earn-out liability as of December
31, 2022 was $14.6 million and was included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. For additional information,
refer to “Note 3 - Acquisitions, Divestitures, and Investments.”

In connection with an insignificant acquisition in 2021, the Company recorded a contingent earn-out liability to be paid based on achievement of
employee retention benchmarks. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company made payments of $3.1 million to fully settle this
outstanding obligation, which was outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and was included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet.

**17. Share-Based Compensation**

**_Overview of Employee Share-Based Compensation Plans_**

The Company has two share-based compensation plans, the Syneos Health, Inc. 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (“2018 Plan”) and the Syneos Health,
Inc. 2016 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended and restated (“ESPP”). In addition, the Company had the INC Research Holdings, Inc. 2014
Equity Incentive Plan (“2014 Plan”) and the INC Research Holdings, Inc. 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (“2010 Plan”) that were terminated effective
May 24, 2018 and October 30, 2014, respectively, except as to outstanding awards. No further awards can be issued under the 2014 Plan or 2010
Plan. The 2018 Plan became effective on May 24, 2018, and permits granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards,
restricted stock units (“RSUs”), or stock awards to employees, as well as non-employee directors, consultants, or other personal service providers.
The terms of share-based instruments granted are determined at the time of grant and are typically subject to such conditions as continued
employment, passage of time, and/or satisfaction of performance criteria. The Company has granted stock options and time-vesting RSUs, which
typically vest ratably over a two- or three-year period from the grant date. In addition, the Company has granted performance-vesting RSUs. The
Board and the Compensation and Management Development Committee have the discretion to determine different vesting schedules. Stock options
have a maximum term of ten years. The exercise price per share of stock options may not be less than the fair market value of a share of the
Company’s common stock on the date of grant.

As of December 31, 2022, the maximum number of shares reserved for issuance under the Company’s share-based compensation plans was
15,167,325, of which 2,152,097 shares were available for future grants as of December 31, 2022. In addition, under the 2018 Plan, any shares of the
Company’s common stock that are retained by or returned to the Company under any outstanding awards that are canceled, expired, forfeited,
surrendered, settled in cash, or otherwise terminated prior to vesting or exercise without delivery of the shares, in each case, become available for
future grants.

**_Employee Stock Purchase Plan_**

In March 2016, the Board approved the ESPP, which was also approved by the Company’s shareholders in May 2016. The ESPP was subsequently
amended and restated and approved by the Board in March 2018, and also approved by the Company’s shareholders in May 2018. The ESPP allows
eligible employees to authorize payroll deductions of up to 10% of their annual base salary or wages to be applied toward the purchase of full shares
of the Company’s common stock on the last trading day of the offering period. Participating employees can purchase shares of the Company’s
common stock at a 15% discount to the lesser of the closing price of the Company’s common stock as quoted on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange on (i)
the first trading day of the offering period or (ii) the last trading day of the offering period. Offering periods under the ESPP are six months in
duration, and the first offering period began on September 1, 2016. Under the ESPP, the Company recognized share-based compensation expense of
$7.2 million, $6.2 million, and $5.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, there
were 1,970,357 shares issued and 1,529,643 shares reserved for future issuance under the ESPP.

The fair values of ESPP offerings were determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model and the following assumptions:

**Year Ended December 31,**
**2022** **2021** **2020**
Expected volatility 32.9% - 48.7% 25.3% - 38.3% 27.7% - 55.1%
Risk-free interest rate 0.6% - 3.34% 0.06% - 0.07% 0.13% - 0.95%
Expected term (in years) 0.5 0.5 0.5

**_Time-based Awards_**

The weighted-average grant-date fair value of the RSUs granted during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $76.96 and $62.12,
respectively. The total fair value of shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $51.0 million, $48.3 million,
and $43.0 million, respectively.

**_Performance-Based Awards_**

During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Board and Compensation and Management Development Committee granted
certain executive officers performance-based RSUs (“PRSUs”). The PRSUs are subject to the Company’s achieving certain performance targets
including revenue, Clinical Solutions segment’s net new business awards, adjusted diluted EPS, and return on invested capital (“ROIC”).
Compensation expense related to PRSUs is recorded based on the estimated quantity of awards that are expected to vest. At each reporting period,
management re-assesses the probability that the performance conditions will be achieved and adjusts compensation expense to reflect any changes
in the estimated probability of vesting until the actual level of achievement of the performance targets is known.

A portion of certain of the Company’s performance-based restricted stock units (“PRSUs”) that are granted to certain executive officers are subject
to the Company’s achievement of a specified ROIC. The Company did not meet the minimum threshold for vesting for the tranche of the PRSUs
granted in 2019 associated with ROIC. In March 2022, the Compensation and Management Development Committee awarded PRSUs based on the
Company’s ROIC for 2021 excluding the impact of acquisitions. This was considered a modification under ASC 718, Stock Compensation. As a
result of this modification, the Company incurred $4.2 million of incremental share-based compensation expense during the year ended December
31, 2022.

The weighted-average grant-date fair value of the PRSUs granted during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $75.43 and $62.50,
respectively. The total fair value of shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $7.1 million and $6.4 million,
respectively. No PRSUs were vested or distributed in the year ended December 31, 2020.

**18. Employee Benefit Plans**

**_Defined Contribution Retirement Plans_**

In the U.S., the Company offers defined contribution retirement benefit plans that comply with Section 401(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code under which it matches employee deferrals at varying percentages and at specified limits of the employee’s
salary. In 2020, the Company implemented cost management strategies, including suspending the Company match on U.S.
employee 401(k) contributions for six months. The match was resumed in the fourth quarter of 2020.

The Company’s contributions related to these defined contribution retirement plans were as follows (in thousands):

**Year Ended December 31,**
**2022** **2021** **2020**
Defined contribution retirement plan contributions $ 34,430 $ 30,932 $ 15,049

The Company also has defined contribution retirement plans outside of the U.S. The Company’s contributions related to these
plans were approximately $23.4 million, $23.2 million, and $18.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and
2020, respectively. The Company’s contributions associated with all of its defined contribution retirement plans are recorded in
direct costs and selling, general, and administrative expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

**_Deferred Compensation Plan_**

The Company offers a Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan for certain employees pursuant to Section 409A of the
Internal Revenue Code (“NQDC Plan”). Under this plan, participants can defer, on a pre-tax basis, from 1.0% up to a
maximum of 80.0% of salary and from
1.0% up to a maximum of 100.0% of commissions and annual bonuses. The Company does not make matching contributions
into the NQDC Plan. Distributions will be made to participants upon separation from service or death in a lump sum, unless
installments are selected.

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the NQDC Plan deferred compensation liabilities were $19.1 million and $23.4 million,
respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The assets
associated with the NQDC Plan are subject to the claims of the creditors and primarily consist of investments in mutual funds
maintained in a “rabbi trust”. These investments are classified as trading securities and are included in other long-term assets on
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

**19. Leases**

The Company’s operating leases are primarily related to its office facilities. The Company’s finance leases are related to
vehicles that the Company leases for certain sales representatives in its Commercial Solutions segment. The Company’s leases
have remaining lease terms of less than one year to 10 years, some of which include options to extend the term or terminate the
lease.

ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the fixed lease payments over the lease term at the
commencement date. The ROU assets also include any initial direct costs incurred and lease payments made at or before the
commencement date, and are reduced by lease incentives. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount
rate to determine the present value of the lease payments for leases that do not have a readily determinable implicit discount
rate. The Company’s incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that it would have to borrow on a collateralized basis


-----

over a similar term and amount in a similar economic environment. The Company determines the incremental borrowing rates
for its leases by adjusting the local risk free interest rate with a credit risk premium corresponding to the Company’s credit
rating.

The Company records rent expense for its operating leases on a straight-line basis from the lease commencement date until the
end of the lease term. The Company records finance lease cost as a combination of the amortization expense for the ROU assets
and interest expense for the outstanding lease liabilities using the discount rate discussed above. Variable lease payments for
operating leases are related to office facilities and include but are not limited to common area maintenance, parking, electricity,
and management fees. The variable lease payments for finance leases are related to maintenance programs for leased vehicles.
Variable lease payments are based on occurrence or based on usage; therefore, they are not included as part of the initial
calculations of the ROU assets and liabilities.

The components of lease cost were as follows for the year ended December 31 and the line items on the accompanying
consolidated statements of income to which they were recorded were as follows (in thousands):
