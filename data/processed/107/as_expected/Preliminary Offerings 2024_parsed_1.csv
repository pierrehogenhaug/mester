107_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Our Company,9.1.1,,"We are a global travel experience player in the travel retail and food & beverage industry, with operations in 73 countries on six continents as of December 31, 2023. Our outlets are located in a variety of travel retail and F&B settings with the vast majority of our sales produced by our airport channel (82% and 91% of sales for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively). As of December 31, 2023, we operated approximately 5,100 retail shops and restaurants, with a total sales area of approximately 477,466 square meters, including approximately 3,600 outlets located in airports, approximately 905 outlets located on motorways, approximately 100 outlets operating on cruise lines and seaports, approximately 125 outlets at border, downtown and hotel shops and approximately 370 outlets in railway stations, among others. In 2023, Avolta opened and expanded new outlets, adding almost 11,743 square meters of commercial space across all divisions. Our travel retail operations consist of a variety of retail concepts focusing on the specific needs of travelers, including general travel retail outlets offering a wide range of products, such as perfumes and cosmetics, confectionary and other foods, wines and spirits, luxury goods and tobacco goods, as well as brand boutiques, specialized shops, convenience stores and theme shops. Our F&B operations consist of both franchised and proprietary brands that embody local and international flavors, including F&B outlets with a variety of restaurant settings, such as casual service-style cafés, casual pubs and upscale bars, fast-casual, full-service, quick-service and counter-service restaurants, as well as pre-packaged meals, snacks and beverages. We generated turnover (CORE) of CHF 12,534.6 million and CORE net profit of CHF 456.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to turnover (CORE) of CHF 6,878.4 million and CORE net profit of CHF 189.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. CORE EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2023 was CHF 1,129.6 million, compared to CHF 606.2 million and CHF 386 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.",N/A,as_expected,2024,138
107_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.1,Global market leader in airport travel retail and F&B. We are the clear leader in the global travel retail,"industry, with a market share of 11% in travel retail overall, and close to 20% in airport travel retail based on fiscal year 2023 turnover data, as well as the leader in travel F&B. The global travel retail and F&B market remains fragmented, and while our competitors mostly operate within a restricted regional or local footprint, we have extensive experience in successfully operating global travel retail and F&B businesses. Our global platform and experience in developing new retail facilities in diverse markets, as well as the ability to introduce high-quality suppliers to new outlets, are competitive advantages for us when pursuing new concessions and when negotiating with suppliers, as we are the only travel retail operator that is capable of offering window displays in over 1,000 locations across the globe. Furthermore, as the only truly globally active travel retailer and F&B provider, our customer data helps us identify customer preferences by nationality with respect to brands, products and responsiveness to marketing campaigns and promotions. This allows us to maximize revenues by optimally structuring product assortment displays and in-store marketing activities. 1 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,138
107_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.2,High-quality portfolio benefiting from long-term contracts with high renewal rates and low contract concentration. We have assembled a high-quality and diversified portfolio of travel retail and F&B concessions at,"attractive locations, with an average remaining term of seven years as of December 31, 2023, as calculated by the weighted average of fiscal year 2023 turnover contribution of each contract. In 2023, 25% of our sales were generated from concessions with a remaining term of 10 or more years as of December 31, 2023, 26% of our sales were generated from concessions with a remaining term of between six and nine years as of December 31, 2023, 28% of our sales were generated from concessions with a remaining term of three to five years and 21% of our sales were generated from concessions with a remaining term of between one and two years as of December 31, 2023. That 51% of contracts have a remaining term of over six years is testimony to the resilience of the Avolta business. Moreover, the geographical diversification of our concession portfolio mitigates the risks of local and regional external impacts. Our concession portfolio is also not dependent on any individual contract. Our largest concession contract represented only 4% of our sales in 2023, and our top 10 contracts represented 18% of our total sales in 2023. Our track record as a successful, high-quality operator is important to our long-term relationships with facility owners. Given that a large portion of our concession payments are sales-driven, as a result of the variable component of our concession fees, our facility owners benefit from having a strong operator with a proven ability to grow sales. As a result, we enjoy high renewal rates for existing concessions and high success rates of winning new concessions. We opened approximately 11,743 square meters of gross retail space in 2023, which reflects net retail space growth achieved organically, rather than through M&A activity. Our business operating model leverages global scale with local execution, providing us a distinct competitive advantage. Moreover, we procure on a global basis, and our integrated procurement and logistics platform provides a key competitive advantage for us, as it allows us to extract the full benefits of our global scale and market position. We work with over 1,000 suppliers around the world. Furthermore, a significant portion of our cost base is variable, which provides added resilience to the business.",N/A,as_expected,2024,138

We are a truly global business, with geographically diverse operations across Africa, Asia, Central America, the Caribbean, Europe, North America and South America, combining prime operations in developed markets and high-growth emerging markets. Our operations are also diversified in terms of the products we sell, with a strong focus on high-margin categories. Our core product category is Food, Confectionary and Catering, which represented 43% of our net sales in 2023.

107_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Strategy,9.3.1,Travel Experience Revolution,"We create unrivaled and holistic travel experiences by continuously adapting and evolving our value proposition with a full customer-centric approach based on data insights. The environments where we define, plan and operate travel retail and F&B concepts provide options for stand-alone retail and F&B solutions, as well as combined offerings—including flexible, local, entertaining and hybrid formats—to customize to the traveler’s needs in every single location. State-of-the-art digital engagement initiatives further enhance the overall customer experience along their whole journey. Traveler profiles and expectations are constantly monitored across our global footprint to identify new behaviors and requirements. Demographics and data analysis play a fundamental role in our business as changes in customer profiles and preferences can occur rapidly. For this reason, we set a high priority on consumer intelligence, extrapolated from internal operational information, regular customer field surveys, monitoring of social media channels and external research. This constant process of listening closely to customers allows us to continuously fine-tune our offerings, not only matching, but exceeding expectations of our clients. Maximizing the travel experience can only be achieved through the strong and close collaboration of travel retail and F&B operators with concession partners and brand suppliers. Each one of these partners has a key role to play: operators can create attractive experiential environments, tailoring offerings and services based on refined customer insights, and help to create a sense of place. We share those with brands, allowing them to further innovate their products and experiences. In parallel, concession partners contribute by optimizing space allocation and passenger flows, supporting the setup of flexible and hybrid concepts. We seek a permanent and close collaboration with concession partners and suppliers through the ongoing monitoring of airport, location and outlet performance, flexibly adapting retail and F&B concepts in order to maximize passenger satisfaction, sales, and spend-perpassenger. The key element in making customers happier and providing a flawless holistic travel experience is the unique combination of travel retail and F&B under one roof, generating benefits for customers and concession operators alike. Advantages materialize through the creation of sense-of-place shop and restaurant designs reflecting local cultures and traditions as well as through hybrid and mixed-store formats, which immediately expand and mutually enhance the value proposition and the relevance for customers. This generates additional cross-selling and promotion opportunities offered to customers digitally or through vouchers, encouraging travelers to visit and browse several outlets. The same applies to the relevance and the reach of loyalty programs, which result in a higher attractiveness for customers and an increased number of touchpoints and engagement opportunities for the operators. Our front-line team members play a key role in delivering a transformational shopping and dining experience to our customers. We will continue to further customize engagement with shop and restaurant concepts and service levels adapted to specific needs by geography and passenger profile in order to create memorable experiences and the best possible added value. These advanced engagement initiatives will be supported by comprehensive training, dedicated incentive schemes and technology support. Highly focused use of technology allows us to learn from customer behavior within the shops on an anonymized basis. This provides valuable insights on where to enhance and adapt assortments or allocate additional team members to increase customer service. Data insights optimize both store or F&B concepts and assortment management, while driving performance by initiating concept innovation. 4 ----- Our digital strategy is all about closely engaging with existing and potential customers throughout their travel journey and is focused on achieving three main goals: - further engage with frequent travelers and establish deeper connections. Increase their loyalty by leveraging CRM initiatives, offer and service personalization as well as new mobile apps and partnerships; - excel in sales influenced by new digital touchpoints created with partners across the whole travel journey, by expanding the reach of Reserve & Collect, and evolving the omni-channel engagement and sales approach; and - transform the shopping and dining experience in-store. Intensify the use of technology for enhanced engagement and experience. Develop new services for targeted customer audiences, e.g., the Avolta Employee App. All these initiatives are driven by social media and CRM communication to keep travelers informed about surprising initiatives, activations and in-store experiences. Partnering with suppliers to feature brand-specific content throughout the complete journey is key.",N/A,as_expected,2024,138
107_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Strategy,9.3.2,Geographical Diversification,"Diversification is a recurrent theme in our overall strategy, as diversification enhances resilience and supports growth. Geographic and channel diversification reduces exposure to single contracts or local and regional external impacts as shown by the share in sales: the largest concession accounts for less than 4% of our business, while the 10 biggest represent less than 18% of 2023 sales. With respect to the geographic diversification, the focus is on further developing North America’s footprint, developing a dedicated strategy for the top Asia-Pacific countries and the Chinese travelers in particular, as well as to foster and grow our position in the rest of the world. In all geographies, the aim is to optimize the combination of duty-free, duty-paid and F&B offers by either growing organically through new contract wins or joint ventures, as well as by benefiting from bolt-on M&A opportunities where strategically feasible. With respect to North America, we have a presence in approximately 100 airports—with a significant overlap of retail and F&B—and see potential incremental organic growth opportunities in what is typically a very resilient market. For our existing concession partners, our new hybrid concepts, including F&B and travel retail, enhance our offer, consequently boosting customer experience while allowing airports to optimize retail space, passenger flows and ultimately spend-per-passenger and revenue generation. Moreover, the unique sets of expertise in both the travel retail and F&B sectors increase our attractiveness when participating in tenders in new locations where we are not yet present. The comprehensive know-how on passenger shopping and dining behaviors and insights covering both domestic and international profiles across North America—as well as rest of the world—is an important competitive advantage put at the service of each airport operator. In cases where the airport wants only one partner to manage all its commercial spaces, we can provide extensive master concessionaire services. Until 2019, Asia Pacific was the fastest growing travel retail market and is expected to resume this leading position in the coming years. Equally, Chinese travelers contributed to close to 40% of Asia Pacific’s passenger volume, and this is expected to grow further over the medium term. Based on this insight, the key success factor in Asia Pacific is to strongly engage with Chinese passengers domestically as well as when they travel internationally to neighboring countries such as Vietnam and Indonesia, amongst others, given that 80% of Chinese international travel is within the Asia Pacific region. A strong local presence and a dedicated strategy focused on this geographic area are therefore key to harnessing the high spending power of the Chinese customer. 5 ----- We already have a solid footprint in the Asia Pacific region with operations in 11 countries and feature a wide variety of retail formats and F&B concepts, and are well positioned for further expansion in existing and new locations. Channels cover duty-paid, duty-free and F&B. Similar to other geographies, the opportunity of offering airport operators hybrid and combined retail and F&B concepts through one single partner creates additional potential to grow organically in this important region. As an example, in 2023 we entered into a joint venture with Hubei Airport Group to act as master concessionaire at Wuhan Tianhe Airport’s newly built Terminal 2 in central China. Another important asset in Asia Pacific and China is the partnership with Alibaba, established in 2020. This also includes an equity participation by Alibaba in Avolta. On the one hand, it secures a strong onsite presence in Hainan, through the joint presence of Alibaba and Avolta in a joint venture in the Global Duty Free Plaza of the Mova Hall Shopping Center in Haikou, with a retail area of close to 39,000 square meters and featuring several hundred international brands. On the other hand, it extends Alibaba’s ecosystem into travel retail, allowing us to engage more closely with Chinese travelers worldwide through different online channels and services, thus fostering our omni-channel approach. These include customer services covering the whole travel journey (i.e., from preordering and buying before the trip, buying and collecting during the trip to repurchasing after the trip). By leveraging Alibaba’s presence and access to all relevant online platforms in the region, the joint venture secures strong digital customer engagement and widespread presence in the market. We are currently present in 73 countries covering six continents. We have some of our largest footprints and strongest positions in North America, Europe, the Middle East and Central & South America. Some of these geographies feature a dense network of operations in single countries as in North America and Europe, or regionally as in Central & South America. Expected growth in passenger numbers over the next five years, coupled with expanded offerings, creates attractive scale prospects. In many of these markets, our combined expertise of travel retail and F&B is seen as an additional asset by concession operators wanting to offer their passengers an enhanced customer experience, while at the same time simplifying space management and improving performance of their overall retail area. Leveraging existing partnerships in these markets and providing attractive alternatives in new locations, including airports, train stations and motorways, will permit us to strengthen our footprint in some of the world’s most important tourist destinations. In all these markets, further growth can be driven organically, through joint ventures or by bolt-on M&A transactions alike.",N/A,as_expected,2024,138

For us, this means identifying operational savings by actively managing our business and customer portfolio. Key trends and methodologies to actively drive costs as well as reset and improve efficiency require focusing on what is critical and needed to run the business. Identifying new technologies to implement new ways of working, leveraging the power of digital data, as well as increasing flexibility and agility, are key to this. We understand the concept of zero-based budgeting in the wider sense, assessing every single activity, how it contributes to the business, and how it can be improved. We will regularly screen and assess our concession portfolio with respect to its profitability to react in a timely manner with respect to renegotiating or exiting contracts which do not fulfill our concession-specific objectives and expectations. Over time, this will allow us to consistently improve portfolio quality and performance. In this context, we will also engage in an ongoing evaluation, analysis and discussion with some of the most critical airports to jointly identify and develop possible growth and efficiency levers, the key prerequisite being a permanent and cyclical performance review and re-evaluation of the portfolio, starting with the pre-contractual duediligence and extending throughout the duration of each concession. 6 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,138

These CORE figures exclude exceptional acquisition and disposal-related expenses and income, and also exclude impairments and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, which can differ significantly from year to year. Our profit or loss statement in accordance with IFRS is materially impacted by IFRS 16 lease accounting. CORE figures exclude the accounting impact resulting from the IFRS 16 lease accounting standard. This is achieved by reversing IFRS 16-related profit or loss line items (i.e., depreciation of right-of-use assets and lease interest) and adding the relevant concession fee owed based on the corresponding concession agreement. For this same reason, we consider all our concession fees and corresponding payments as CORE to our business, in contrast to IFRS 16, which treats fixed payments as a financing activity. In addition, we believe that the straight-line depreciation of right-of-use assets does not reflect the economic reality of our business and the operational performance of our Group. We use these adjusted results in addition to IFRS as important factors in internally assessing the Group’s performance.

The previous segment known as The Americas was split into Latin America (“LATAM”) and North America. Furthermore, certain countries have been reallocated from Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) to Asia Pacific (“APAC”). In addition, the Group allocates advertising income to the operating segments. The comparative figures have been presented accordingly to reflect these changes. We present the CORE EBITDA KPI, which is used by the Global Executive Committee to monitor the Group’s performance. This indicator provides the most relevant view of our business and represents an operational KPI that excludes the accounting impact resulting from IFRS 16-related profit or loss line items (i.e., depreciation of right-ofuse assets and lease interest) and adds the relevant concession fee owed based on the corresponding concession agreement.

Our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 reflect our combination with Autogrill. On February 3, 2023, Avolta closed the business combination with Autogrill. In consideration for the transfer of the 50.3% stake in Autogrill to Avolta, Edizione S.p.A. (“Edizione”) (through its wholly owned subsidiary Schema Beta S.p.A.) was issued mandatory convertible non-interest bearing notes convertible into an aggregate of 30,663,329 newly issued Dufry shares, at an implied exchange ratio of 0.158 new Dufry shares for each Autogrill share. Edizione exercised its conversion right following closing on February 3, 2023, of the transfer and was issued 30,663,329 Dufry shares. After the initial acquisition of the 50.3% stake on February 3, 2023, Dufry launched a mandatory takeover offer (“MTO”) for the outstanding Autogrill shares and acquired, through July 24, 2023, in several steps all the remaining Autogrill shares (49.7%) for a total consideration of CHF 1,304.6 million, thereof paid in shares CHF 1,260.5 million and a total consideration paid in cash of CHF 44.1 million equivalent to EUR 6.33 per share. From the date when Dufry took control of the Autogrill operations on February 3, 2023 until December 31, 2023, Autogrill operations contributed CHF 4,538.8 million in turnover and a net profit of CHF 47.9 million to the Group. If the business combination had taken place at the beginning of 2023, Autogrill would have generated a turnover of CHF 4,890.5 million (unaudited) and a net profit of CHF 29.4 million (unaudited). Please refer to note 6 of our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 for further details in respect of the combination with Autogrill.",N/A,as_expected,2024,138

The occurrence of any one of a number of events outside our control such as terrorist attacks (including cyberattacks), hurricanes, fires, ash clouds, pandemics, the outbreak or escalation of hostilities among nations (including the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas conflicts), natural disasters, air traffic control disruptions, including strikes by controllers, accidents and actions by aviation authorities against airlines or airplane manufacturers, may lead to a reduction in the number of air travelers on a global, regional or local level. Further, growth may be inhibited due to increases in oil prices, which lead to higher fuel surcharges and ticket prices and restrict customers’ budgets by increasing the general cost of living. Similarly, new regulations and taxes, such as a surcharge to compensate for the carbon emissions caused by air travel that has been proposed or already introduced in a number of countries, could have a similar effect. Any future event of a similar nature, even if not directly affecting the airline industry, may lead to a significant decrease in the number of air travelers. Further, any disruption to or suspension of services provided by airlines, as a result of financial difficulties, labor disputes or shortages, construction work, increased security or otherwise, could negatively affect the number of air passengers. Such a reduction in airline passenger numbers would result in a decrease in our sales and may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The events that could cause a decrease in airline passenger traffic could also have a similar effect on our operations that serve passengers using other forms of travel, such as shops and restaurants on motorways, cruise lines, ferries, at seaports, train stations, downtown tourist locations and others, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Since our success is dependent on consumer spending, our business may be adversely affected by factors such as an economic downturn in these economies that could cause a rise in unemployment, a decline in consumer confidence, changes in exchange rates, an increase in interest rates, inflation, deflation, direct or indirect taxes and consumer debt levels. In particular, our EMEA and North America segments represented 51% and 31%, respectively, of our total sales in 2023.

We compete with other travel retailers and F&B service providers at global, regional and local levels in obtaining and renewing or extending these concessions. Some of our competitors have strong financial support or solid relationships with concession grantors, which benefit those competitors in competing for concessions. There is no guarantee that we will be able to win new concessions, ----- renew our existing concessions or that, if we do renew a concession, it will be on similar commercial and other terms. In addition, failure to obtain or renew a concession necessarily means that we will not be able to enter or continue operating in the market during the contract term represented by such concession. If we were to fail to renew major concessions or fail to obtain further concessions, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a result of competition among travel retailers to obtain or maintain retail concessions, airport authorities and other landlords have increasingly been able to demand more favorable concession terms. In addition to shorter terms, concession agreements generally provide for minimum annual guarantee (“MAG”) payments, which are a minimum fee payable to the airport operator regardless of the amount of sales at the concession. Currently, the majority of our concessions provide for a MAG that is either a fixed amount or an amount that is variable based upon the number of travelers using the airport or other location, retail space used, estimated sales, past results or other metrics. If passenger numbers are lower than expected or if there is a decline in the sales per passenger at these facilities, this may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,138

While our concessions had an average maturity of more than seven years as of December 31, 2023, they may be unilaterally terminated or modified prior to the end of the original expiration date upon expropriation or annulment by the respective authorities or forfeiture by us. Forfeiture may be declared by the authorities if the concessionaire fails to fulfill the terms and conditions set forth in the concession agreement as well as applicable legal and regulatory obligations. Annulment may be declared by the authorities or by courts if the act granting the concession or its terms do not comply with the appropriate legal requirements, such as procurement, antitrust or similar regulations. The concessions may also be terminated early by airport and motorway authorities or landlords in certain circumstances including, among others: - assignment, transfer or sub-lease by us to third parties, in whole or in part, of the rights or obligations provided for in the relevant agreement without the prior approval of the authority or grantor; - a change of control; - failure by us to comply with any of the material provisions of the concession agreement; - use by us of the concession area for any purpose other than the object of the agreement; - entry by us into an agreement with a third party with respect to the concession area or services to be explored without the applicable airport or motorway authorities’ prior approval; - making of any modification to the facilities without the applicable airport or motorway authorities’ prior approval; - default by us on the payment of the fees for a period provided for in the relevant agreement; - failure by us to provide services with an adequate quality level, comply with service-level agreements or obtain the necessary equipment for the satisfactory rendering of such services; - becoming a sanctioned party under OFAC or similar sanction regulations; or - reasons of public interest.",N/A,as_expected,2024,138

Our Destination 2027 ----- strategy aims to achieve further growth by addressing evolving consumer trends, driving spend per passenger and responding to the changing needs of airports. In this regard, our future growth will depend upon a number of factors, some of which may not be within our control, such as the timing of any concession or acquisition opportunity, our ability to identify any such opportunities, structure a competitive proposal, obtain required financing or consummate an offer. As a result, we cannot assure you that this strategy will be successful. In addition, we may encounter difficulties integrating expanded or new concessions or any acquisitions into our existing operations. For example, concessions often contain covenants that limit the ability to conduct our operations, including the range of products that may be offered for sale and the pricing policies that are applied. The need to comply with such covenants could prevent us from, among other things, adapting the range of products offered to accommodate changing consumer preferences, or integrating and combining new products and concessions that have been obtained through acquisitions. As a result, such expansions, new concessions or acquisitions may not achieve anticipated revenue and earnings growth or synergies and cost savings. Delays in the startup of new projects and the refurbishment of shops and restaurants also affect our business.

In particular, Autogrill manages a large portfolio of brands and services across a variety of countries, including products and services in the travel F&B sector that we have not traditionally offered. As a result of the combination, we may face various risks relating to organizational integration; heightened operational, employee management and regulatory risks; liability and reputational harm related to food safety risks; challenges in anticipating consumer trends and maintaining our competitive position throughout all the markets in which we operate; and exposure to litigation or intellectual property infringement claims related to proprietary brands and third-party relationships that we assumed through the business combination. If any of the risks associated with the newly combined Company materialize, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There are integration costs and non-recurring transaction costs associated with the combination, including costs associated with combining our operations and achieving the synergies we expect to obtain, and such costs have been, and may continue to be, significant.

The measures taken to address public health crises, such as restrictions on domestic and international travel as well as the unwillingness of a large part of the population to travel given the health risks associated with such crises, have had, and may again have, a significant negative impact on the travel industry. As a result, all aspects of our business have been, and may again be, materially negatively impacted. For example, due to the unprecedented level of disruption of domestic and international travel resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, including travel restrictions adopted by governments worldwide and operational shutdowns of airports, cruise lines and other travel channels, passenger numbers at the facilities where we operate were dramatically reduced and turnover decreased by 71.1% in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the prior year. ----- We are also not able to predict whether health crises will result in permanent changes to travelers’ behavior, with such potential changes including a permanent reduction in business travel as a result of increased usage of “virtual” and “teleconferencing” products and more broadly a general reluctance by consumers to travel or purchase retail and F&B products in travel locations, each of which could have a material impact on our business.

In 2023, duty free products accounted for 37% of our net sales. Governmental authorities in various countries in which we operate may alter or eliminate the duty-free status of certain products or otherwise change importation or tax laws. Further, sales and excise taxes on products sold at traditional retail locations may be lowered in the future, partly removing our competitive advantage with respect to duty-free product pricing. If we lose the ability to sell duty-free products in any of our major duty-free markets or if we lose market share to traditional retailers as a result of a reduction in sales and excise taxes, our revenues may decrease significantly and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In addition, we are subject to tax audits and proceedings from time to time in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes and penalties.

The outcome of such legal proceedings is uncertain, and our involvement may require significant resources, time and effort, and may divert the attention of our management. While the outcome of any legal proceedings and the potential damages and other losses we may incur arising out of any current or future legal proceedings are inherently difficult to predict, we may have to pay substantial damages, settlement costs and, in turn, increased insurance premiums if a claim is resolved against us. Even if a claim is not resolved against us, we may incur significant legal fees, which we may not recoup. Deciding whether or not to provide for a loss in connection with such legal proceedings requires us to make determinations about various factual and legal matters beyond our control. Legal proceedings for which we have recognized insufficient provisions or any future related claims for which we have not recognized any provisions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Due to the geographic diversity of our employee base, we have significant exposure to changes in foreign laws governing our relationships with employees, such as minimum wage requirements, workers’ compensation rates, hour laws and regulations, fair labor standards (including the use of rest days by employees), overtime pay, and unemployment and payroll taxes. A significant increase in minimum wage requirements or overtime pay in the countries in which we operate could have a material adverse impact on our operating costs and may require us to reduce our margins or expend additional resources to mitigate such increases.

Business climates in these markets expose us to greater political, economic, legal and social uncertainty than markets with more developed institutional structures. The risk of loss resulting from changes in law, economic disruptions, social upheaval, currency devaluations, hyperinflation, corruption and other ----- factors may be substantial. For example, these factors could decrease tourism to countries where we operate, some of which are holiday destinations. We are also exposed to risks arising from interruptions of operations due to political or social instability, regional conflicts and the establishment or enforcement of foreign exchange restrictions, which could effectively prevent us from repatriating profits, liquidating assets or withdrawing funds from one or more of these markets. For example, our business could be affected by further instability in the Middle East, including as a result of the IsraelHamas conflict, and prolonged or recurring currency devaluations in Brazil and Argentina. Similarly, the RussiaUkraine war has had a negative impact on our operations due to the decrease in international air travel to and from Russia, international sanctions regimes with respect to Russia and the suspension of our operations in Ukraine. Further, countries like China have imposed severe travel restrictions in recent years, which have negatively affected our revenue from Chinese tourists both within China and in our other markets. Furthermore, changes in regulations or enforcement mechanisms could substantially reduce or eliminate any turnover or profits derived from operations in these countries and could reduce significantly the value of assets related to such operations. Another aspect of certain emerging markets is the potential inadequacy of the legal system and law enforcement mechanism, which leaves us exposed to the possibility of considerable loss as a result of abusive practices by competitors, parties with which we contract or others. For example, we participate in a joint venture with Alibaba in China, which subjects us to associated legal, political, social and regulatory risks.

The adoption of new climate-related legislation and regulatory requirements may lead to carbon taxation, increases in energy prices, and additional supply chain and distribution costs. Any significant increase in consumer prices to cover such costs may lead to a decrease in passenger traffic on flights, cruise ships and other means of transportation, which could have a negative impact on our operations. Consumer preference is increasingly impacted by the awareness of climate change, and customers are more frequently demanding responsibly sourced and manufactured products that present lower environmental footprints. Heightened ecological awareness may result in decreased demand for plastics and packaging materials, including single-use and non-recyclable plastic products and packaging. Further, there is growing recognition of the effects that travel has on climate change, which may reduce passenger traffic and cause consumers to choose alternatives to the travel channels in which we operate. Any such changes in consumer preferences may require us to adapt our operations, which could result in increased costs and reduced profitability. The acute and chronic physical effects of climate change, such as severe weather events, rising sea levels and excessive heat, could potentially lead to asset damage and restoration costs, disruptions in our supply chain and the relocation of our operations, among other things. The likelihood of any acute or chronic physical effects is uncertain, and we are not able to accurately predict the materiality of any potential losses or costs associated with the physical effects of climate change at this time.",N/A,as_expected,2024,138

Our principal translation currency exposures are to the euro and the USD. Changes in the relevant exchange rates between the Swiss franc and the other currencies to which we are exposed, which have been volatile recently, have affected and will continue to affect the value of our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the Swiss franc, our costs and our turnover, each of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

In particular, efforts to combat base erosion and profit shifting (“BEPS”) have led to the development of various measures that have already been introduced or are expected to be introduced in the countries in which we operate. On December 20, 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) published the Tax Challenges Arising from the Digitalisation of the Economy—Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules (Pillar Two): Inclusive Framework on BEPS (the “Pillar II Initiative”). The Pillar II Initiative for a coordinated system of taxation consists of an income inclusion rule, an undertaxed profits rule and a qualified domestic minimum top-up tax. The system is intended to ensure that large multinational companies, such as Avolta, pay a minimum level of tax on the income attributable to each of the jurisdictions in which they operate. The European Commission published a legislative proposal to implement the Pillar II Initiative in all 27 member states of the European Union, which was formally adopted by the Council of the European Union on December 15, 2022.

In such circumstances, if a court voided such Guarantee, or held it unenforceable, noteholders would cease to have any claim in respect of the Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and the remaining Guarantors.

Our outlets are located in a variety of travel retail and F&B settings with the vast majority of our sales produced by our airport channel (82% and 91% of sales for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively). As of December 31, 2023, we operated approximately 5,100 retail shops and restaurants, with a total sales area of approximately 477,466 square meters, including approximately 3,600 outlets located in airports, approximately 905 outlets located on motorways, approximately 100 outlets operating on cruise lines and seaports, approximately 125 outlets at border, downtown and hotel shops and approximately 370 outlets in railway stations, among others. In 2023, Avolta opened and expanded new outlets, adding almost 11,743 square meters of commercial space across all divisions. Our travel retail operations consist of a variety of retail concepts focusing on the specific needs of travelers, including general travel retail outlets offering a wide range of products, such as perfumes and cosmetics, confectionary and other foods, wines and spirits, luxury goods and tobacco goods, as well as brand boutiques, specialized shops, convenience stores and theme shops. Our F&B operations consist of both franchised and proprietary brands that embody local and international flavors, including F&B outlets with a variety of restaurant settings, such as casual service-style cafés, casual pubs and upscale bars, fast-casual, full-service, quick-service and counter-service restaurants, as well as pre-packaged meals, snacks and beverages.

We are the clear leader in the global travel retail,"industry, with a market share of 11% in travel retail overall, and close to 20% in airport travel retail based on fiscal year 2023 turnover data, as well as the leader in travel F&B. The global travel retail and F&B market remains fragmented, and while our competitors mostly operate within a restricted regional or local footprint, we have extensive experience in successfully operating global travel retail and F&B businesses. Our global platform and experience in developing new retail facilities in diverse markets, as well as the ability to introduce high-quality suppliers to new outlets, are competitive advantages for us when pursuing new concessions and when negotiating with suppliers, as we are the only travel retail operator that is capable of offering window displays in over 1,000 locations across the globe. Furthermore, as the only truly globally active travel retailer and F&B provider, our customer data helps us identify customer preferences by nationality with respect to brands, products and responsiveness to marketing campaigns and promotions. This allows us to maximize revenues by optimally structuring product assortment displays and in-store marketing activities.",N/A,as_expected,2024,138
107_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,15,CAPITALIZATION,15.6,Our Strengths,15.6.2,High-quality portfolio benefiting from long-term contracts with high renewal rates and low contract concentration. We have assembled a high-quality and diversified portfolio of travel retail and F&B concessions at,"attractive locations, with an average remaining term of seven years as of December 31, 2023, as calculated by the weighted average of fiscal year 2023 turnover contribution of each contract. In 2023, 25% of our sales were generated from concessions with a remaining term of 10 or more years as of December 31, 2023, 26% of our sales were generated from concessions with a remaining term of between six and nine years as of December 31, 2023, 28% of our sales were generated from concessions with a remaining term of three to five years and 21% of our sales were generated from concessions with a remaining term of between one and two years as of December 31, 2023. That 51% of contracts have a remaining term of over six years is testimony to the resilience of the Avolta business. Moreover, the geographical diversification of our concession portfolio mitigates the risks of local and regional external impacts. ----- Our concession portfolio is also not dependent on any individual contract. Our largest concession contract represented only 4% of our sales in 2023, and our top 10 contracts represented 18% of our total sales in 2023. Our track record as a successful, high-quality operator is important to our long-term relationships with facility owners. Given that a large portion of our concession payments are sales-driven, as a result of the variable component of our concession fees, our facility owners benefit from having a strong operator with a proven ability to grow sales. As a result, we enjoy high renewal rates for existing concessions and high success rates of winning new concessions. We opened approximately 11,743 square meters of gross retail space in 2023, which reflects net retail space growth achieved organically, rather than through M&A activity. Our business operating model leverages global scale with local execution, providing us a distinct competitive advantage. Moreover, we procure on a global basis, and our integrated procurement and logistics platform provides a key competitive advantage for us, as it allows us to extract the full benefits of our global scale and market position. We work with over 1,000 suppliers around the world. Furthermore, a significant portion of our cost base is variable, which provides added resilience to the business.",N/A,as_expected,2024,138

107_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,15,CAPITALIZATION,15.7,Our Strategy,15.7.1,Travel Experience Revolution,"We create unrivaled and holistic travel experiences by continuously adapting and evolving our value proposition with a full customer-centric approach based on data insights. The environments where we define, plan and operate travel retail and F&B concepts provide options for stand-alone retail and F&B solutions, as well as combined offerings—including flexible, local, entertaining and hybrid formats—to customize to the traveler’s needs in every single location. State-of-the-art digital engagement initiatives further enhance the overall customer experience along their whole journey. Traveler profiles and expectations are constantly monitored across our global footprint to identify new behaviors and requirements. Demographics and data analysis play a fundamental role in our business as changes in customer profiles and preferences can occur rapidly. For this reason, we set a high priority on consumer intelligence, extrapolated from internal operational information, regular customer field surveys, monitoring of social media ----- channels and external research. This constant process of listening closely to customers allows us to continuously fine-tune our offerings, not only matching, but exceeding expectations of our clients. Maximizing the travel experience can only be achieved through the strong and close collaboration of travel retail and F&B operators with concession partners and brand suppliers. Each one of these partners has a key role to play: operators can create attractive experiential environments, tailoring offerings and services based on refined customer insights, and help to create a sense of place. We share those with brands, allowing them to further innovate their products and experiences. In parallel, concession partners contribute by optimizing space allocation and passenger flows, supporting the setup of flexible and hybrid concepts. We seek a permanent and close collaboration with concession partners and suppliers through the ongoing monitoring of airport, location and outlet performance, flexibly adapting retail and F&B concepts in order to maximize passenger satisfaction, sales, and spend-perpassenger. The key element in making customers happier and providing a flawless holistic travel experience is the unique combination of travel retail and F&B under one roof, generating benefits for customers and concession operators alike. Advantages materialize through the creation of sense-of-place shop and restaurant designs reflecting local cultures and traditions as well as through hybrid and mixed-store formats, which immediately expand and mutually enhance the value proposition and the relevance for customers. This generates additional cross-selling and promotion opportunities offered to customers digitally or through vouchers, encouraging travelers to visit and browse several outlets. The same applies to the relevance and the reach of loyalty programs, which result in a higher attractiveness for customers and an increased number of touchpoints and engagement opportunities for the operators. Our front-line team members play a key role in delivering a transformational shopping and dining experience to our customers. We will continue to further customize engagement with shop and restaurant concepts and service levels adapted to specific needs by geography and passenger profile in order to create memorable experiences and the best possible added value. These advanced engagement initiatives will be supported by comprehensive training, dedicated incentive schemes and technology support. Highly focused use of technology allows us to learn from customer behavior within the shops on an anonymized basis. This provides valuable insights on where to enhance and adapt assortments or allocate additional team members to increase customer service. Data insights optimize both store or F&B concepts and assortment management, while driving performance by initiating concept innovation. Our digital strategy is all about closely engaging with existing and potential customers throughout their travel journey and is focused on achieving three main goals: - further engage with frequent travelers and establish deeper connections. Increase their loyalty by leveraging CRM initiatives, offer and service personalization as well as new mobile apps and partnerships; - excel in sales influenced by new digital touchpoints created with partners across the whole travel journey, by expanding the reach of Reserve & Collect, and evolving the omni-channel engagement and sales approach; and - transform the shopping and dining experience in-store. Intensify the use of technology for enhanced engagement and experience. Develop new services for targeted customer audiences, e.g., the Avolta Employee App. All these initiatives are driven by social media and CRM communication to keep travelers informed about surprising initiatives, activations and in-store experiences. Partnering with suppliers to feature brand-specific content throughout the complete journey is key.",N/A,as_expected,2024,138
107_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,15,CAPITALIZATION,15.7,Our Strategy,15.7.2,Geographical Diversification,"Diversification is a recurrent theme in our overall strategy, as diversification enhances resilience and supports growth. Geographic and channel diversification reduces exposure to single contracts or local and regional external impacts as shown by the share in sales: the largest concession accounts for less than 4% of our business, while the 10 biggest represent less than 18% of 2023 sales. ----- With respect to the geographic diversification, the focus is on further developing North America’s footprint, developing a dedicated strategy for the top Asia-Pacific countries and the Chinese travelers in particular, as well as to foster and grow our position in the rest of the world. In all geographies, the aim is to optimize the combination of duty-free, duty-paid and F&B offers by either growing organically through new contract wins or joint ventures, as well as by benefiting from bolt-on M&A opportunities where strategically feasible. With respect to North America, we have a presence in approximately 100 airports—with a significant overlap of retail and F&B—and see potential incremental organic growth opportunities in what is typically a very resilient market. For our existing concession partners, our new hybrid concepts, including F&B and travel retail, enhance our offer, consequently boosting customer experience while allowing airports to optimize retail space, passenger flows and ultimately spend-per-passenger and revenue generation. Moreover, the unique sets of expertise in both the travel retail and F&B sectors increase our attractiveness when participating in tenders in new locations where we are not yet present. The comprehensive know-how on passenger shopping and dining behaviors and insights covering both domestic and international profiles across North America—as well as rest of the world—is an important competitive advantage put at the service of each airport operator. In cases where the airport wants only one partner to manage all its commercial spaces, we can provide extensive master concessionaire services. Until 2019, Asia Pacific was the fastest growing travel retail market and is expected to resume this leading position in the coming years. Equally, Chinese travelers contributed to close to 40% of Asia Pacific’s passenger volume, and this is expected to grow further over the medium term. Based on this insight, the key success factor in Asia Pacific is to strongly engage with Chinese passengers domestically as well as when they travel internationally to neighboring countries such as Vietnam and Indonesia, amongst others, given that 80% of Chinese international travel is within the Asia Pacific region. A strong local presence and a dedicated strategy focused on this geographic area are therefore key to harnessing the high spending power of the Chinese customer. We already have a solid footprint in the Asia Pacific region with operations in 11 countries and feature a wide variety of retail formats and F&B concepts, and are well positioned for further expansion in existing and new locations. Channels cover duty-paid, duty-free and F&B. Similar to other geographies, the opportunity of offering airport operators hybrid and combined retail and F&B concepts through one single partner creates additional potential to grow organically in this important region. As an example, in 2023 we entered into a joint venture with Hubei Airport Group to act as master concessionaire at Wuhan Tianhe Airport’s newly built Terminal 2 in central China. Another important asset in Asia Pacific and China is the partnership with Alibaba, established in 2020. This also includes an equity participation by Alibaba in Avolta. On the one hand, it secures a strong onsite presence in Hainan, through the joint presence of Alibaba and Avolta in a joint venture in the Global Duty Free Plaza of the Mova Hall Shopping Center in Haikou, with a retail area of close to 39,000 square meters and featuring several hundred international brands. On the other hand, it extends Alibaba’s ecosystem into travel retail, allowing us to engage more closely with Chinese travelers worldwide through different online channels and services, thus fostering our omni-channel approach. These include customer services covering the whole travel journey (i.e., from preordering and buying before the trip, buying and collecting during the trip to repurchasing after the trip). By leveraging Alibaba’s presence and access to all relevant online platforms in the region, the joint venture secures strong digital customer engagement and widespread presence in the market. We are currently present in 73 countries covering six continents. We have some of our largest footprints and strongest positions in North America, Europe, the Middle East and Central & South America. Some of these geographies feature a dense network of operations in single countries as in North America and Europe, or regionally as in Central & South America. Expected growth in passenger numbers over the next five years, coupled with expanded offerings, creates attractive scale prospects. In many of these markets, our combined expertise of travel retail and F&B is seen as an additional asset by concession operators wanting to offer their passengers an enhanced customer experience, while at the same time simplifying space management and improving performance of their overall retail area. Leveraging existing ----- partnerships in these markets and providing attractive alternatives in new locations, including airports, train stations and motorways, will permit us to strengthen our footprint in some of the world’s most important tourist destinations. In all these markets, further growth can be driven organically, through joint ventures or by bolt-on M&A transactions alike.",N/A,as_expected,2024,138

For us, this means identifying operational savings by actively managing our business and customer portfolio. Key trends and methodologies to actively drive costs as well as reset and improve efficiency require focusing on what is critical and needed to run the business. Identifying new technologies to implement new ways of working, leveraging the power of digital data, as well as increasing flexibility and agility, are key to this. We understand the concept of zero-based budgeting in the wider sense, assessing every single activity, how it contributes to the business, and how it can be improved. We will regularly screen and assess our concession portfolio with respect to its profitability to react in a timely manner with respect to renegotiating or exiting contracts which do not fulfill our concession-specific objectives and expectations. Over time, this will allow us to consistently improve portfolio quality and performance. In this context, we will also engage in an ongoing evaluation, analysis and discussion with some of the most critical airports to jointly identify and develop possible growth and efficiency levers, the key prerequisite being a permanent and cyclical performance review and re-evaluation of the portfolio, starting with the pre-contractual duediligence and extending throughout the duration of each concession.",N/A,as_expected,2024,138

Our ESG engagement is focused on four key areas, where we want to have a positive impact within the scope of our stakeholder ecosystem and beyond. These four key areas are (i) create sustainable travel experiences, (ii) respect our planet, (iii) empower our people and (iv) engage local communities. As part of our sustainability strategy, we have developed Science Based Target initiative (“SBTi”) based emission reduction targets to reduce our overall carbon emission footprint going forward. The reduction strategy covering Scope 1 and 2 emissions of our own operations follows SBTi’s 1.5[o ]C pathway and aims at achieving climate neutrality by 2025. Additionally, we plan to reduce Scope 3 emissions following SBTi’s well below the 2[o] C pathway through tight collaboration and engagement with brand partners and logistics service providers. As part of our climate strategy implementation, we have conducted a comprehensive analysis of our carbon emissions profile in order to define SBTi-based reduction targets covering our global operations and the complete business model. Science-based greenhouse gas emission targets consider the level of decarbonization required to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, which are to limit global warming to well-below 2[o] C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit global warming to 1.5[o] C. Our emission reduction targets follow the SBTi criteria and recommendations, and we plan to submit our emission reduction targets to SBTi for validation. For Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our own operations, we follow the SBTi’s 1.5[o] C pathway and aim to achieve climate neutrality by 2025. We believe that these emissions will be reduced and eliminated by implementing energy efficiency measures at different levels, using green electricity and compensating remaining unavoidable emissions with carbon offsetting initiatives. For Scope 3 emissions, we aim to follow the well-below 2[o] C SBTi’s pathway with two separate sets of initiatives and objectives. Through supplier engagement programs, we aim to ensure that by 2027, 74% of our suppliers by emissions covering purchased goods and services will have science-based emission reduction targets as validated by SBTi. At the same time, through collaboration with our logistics partners, we plan to reduce our logistics carbon footprint by 28% by 2030.",N/A,as_expected,2024,138

This special status subjects us to bonded warehouse regulations that require, for example, that any bonded merchandise not be commingled with local merchandise or other non-bonded merchandise. We are also subject to certain truth-in-advertising, general customs, consumer and data protection, product safety, workers’ health and safety and public health rules that govern retailers in general as well the merchandise sold within the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Furthermore, the airport authorities in the United States frequently require that our subsidiaries associate themselves with a Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (“DBE”).

Within 30 days following the date upon which the Change of Control occurs, unless the Issuer has exercised its right to redeem the Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption,” with respect to the Notes, prior to any Change of Control but after the public announcement of the pending Change of Control, the Issuer or the Company will be required to send, by mail (or otherwise deliver in accordance with the applicable rules and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream), a notice to each Holder of Notes, with a copy to the Trustee and Principal Paying Agent, which notice will govern the terms of the Change of Control Offer. Such notice will state, among other things, the purchase date, which must be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (or otherwise delivered in accordance with the applicable rules and procedures of Euroclear and ----- Clearstream), other than as may be required by law (the “Change of Control Payment Date”). The notice, if mailed (or otherwise delivered in accordance with the applicable rules and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream) prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, will state that the Change of Control Offer is conditioned on the Change of Control being consummated on or prior to the Change of Control Payment Date. On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer or the Company will, to the extent lawful, (1) accept or cause a third party to accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit or cause a third party to deposit with the Principal Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered; and (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Registrar the Notes accepted together with an Officer’s Certificate (with a copy to the Trustee) stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of Notes being repurchased. The Principal Paying Agent will promptly deliver to each Holder of Notes properly tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Issuer will promptly issue, and upon delivery of an authentication order from the Issuer, the authentication agent will promptly authenticate and send (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each Holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any. The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require the Issuer or Company to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The Issuer or Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer with respect to the Notes if (1) a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for such an offer made by the Issuer or Company and such third party purchases all the Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer or (2) notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described above under the caption “—Optional Redemption.” Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (by the issuer or the Company, or a third party as contemplated by the immediately preceding paragraph), if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. Notes repurchased by the Issuer or the Company pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will have the status of Notes issued but not outstanding or will be retired and canceled at the option of the Issuer or the Company, as applicable. Notes purchased by a third party pursuant to the preceding paragraph will have the status of Notes issued and outstanding. If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer or the Company, or any third party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer or the Company as described above, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer, the Company or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the redemption date. The Issuer and the Company will comply in all material respects with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control. To the extent that the provisions of any such securities laws or regulations applicable to us conflict with the Change of Control Offer provisions of the Notes, the Issuer and the Company will comply with those securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached our obligations under the Change of Control Offer provisions of the Notes by virtue of any such conflict. ----- In the event a Change of Control occurs at a time when the Issuer or the Company is prohibited, by the terms of any indebtedness, from purchasing the Notes, the Issuer and the Company may seek the consent of the holders of such indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer or the Company does not obtain such a consent or repay such borrowings, the Issuer and the Company would remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Issuer’s or the Company’s failure to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture. For the avoidance of doubt, the Indenture will provide that the Issuer’s or the Company’s failure to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under clause (iv) and not clause (i) under the caption “—Events of Default.” Indebtedness incurred in the future may contain prohibitions on the occurrence of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require the repurchase of such indebtedness upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of Notes of their right to require the Issuer or the Company to repurchase their Notes could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on us. Finally, the ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by the Issuer’s or the Company’s then existing financial resources. We cannot assure you that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—We may be unable to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control.” If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Exchange and the rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will release a notice of any Change of Control through the Exchange (with a copy to the Trustee and Principal Paying Agent) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notice on the official website of the Exchange (www.tisegroup.com). For purposes of the foregoing discussion of a Change of Control Offer, the following definitions are applicable: “Change of Control” means the occurrence of any of the following: (1) the direct or indirect sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation), in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole to any “person” (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) other than the Company or one of its Subsidiaries; (2) the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any “person” (as defined above) becomes the Beneficial Owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Voting Stock of the Company (measured by voting power rather than the number of shares), other than (i) any such transaction where the Voting Stock of the Company (measured by voting power rather than number of shares) outstanding immediately prior to such transaction constitutes or is converted into or exchanged for a majority of the outstanding shares of Voting Stock of such Beneficial Owner (measured by voting power rather than number of shares) or (ii) any merger or consolidation of the Company with or into any person (as defined above) (a “Permitted Person”) or a Subsidiary of a Permitted Person, in each case, if immediately after such transaction no person (as defined above) is the Beneficial Owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the total Voting Stock of such Permitted Person (measured by voting power rather than the number of shares); or (3) the first day on which a majority of the members of the Board of Directors are not Continuing Directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction, including a scheme of arrangement or analogous proceeding, will not be deemed to be a Change of Control if (1) the Company becomes a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of a corporation, limited liability company or similar entity (a “Holding Company”) and (2) (A) the direct or indirect holders of the Voting Stock of such Holding Company immediately following that transaction are substantially the same as the holders of the Company’s Voting Stock immediately prior to that transaction or (B) immediately following that transaction no “person” (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) (other than a Holding Company satisfying the requirements of this sentence) is the Beneficial Owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Voting Stock of such Holding Company. “Continuing Directors” means, as of any date of determination, any member of the Board of Directors who: (1) was a member of such Board of Directors on the date of the Indenture; or ----- (2) was nominated for election or elected to such Board of Directors with the approval of a majority of the Continuing Directors who were members of such board of directors at the time of such nomination or election. The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of “all or substantially all” of the properties or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise, established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the applicability of the requirement that the Issuer or the Company offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another person or group may be uncertain.",N/A,as_expected,2024,138

The Issuer may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and the performance of the Issuer’s obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person. Any such redemption and notice may, in the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, including but not limited to the occurrence of a Change of Control. If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note will state the portion of the principal amount of that Note that is to be redeemed. A new Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Note will be issued in the name of the holder of Notes upon cancellation of the original Note. Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of Notes called for redemption.

The foregoing will constitute Events of Default whatever the reason for any such Event of Default and whether it is voluntary or involuntary or is effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body. However, a Default under clause (iii) will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the Company (and the Trustee if given by Holders) of the Default and the Company does not cure such Default within the time specified in such clause after receipt of such notice. If an Event of Default (other than a Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or insolvent reorganization of the Company) occurs and is continuing under the Indenture, the Trustee by notice to the Company, or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes by notice to the Company and the Trustee, may declare the principal of and accrued but unpaid interest on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon the effectiveness of such a declaration, such principal and interest will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company or a Significant Subsidiary occurs and is continuing, the principal of and accrued but unpaid interest on all the Notes will become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. Under certain circumstances, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may rescind any such acceleration with respect to the Notes and its consequences. Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing and a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice or has obtained actual knowledge thereof, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to it against any costs, fees, damages, losses, liabilities or expenses. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless (i) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing, (ii) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding ----- Notes have requested the Trustee in writing to pursue the remedy, (iii) such Holders have offered to the Trustee security or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against any costs, fees, damages, losses, liabilities or expenses, (iv) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee against any costs, fees, damages, losses, liabilities or expenses and (v) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder (it being understood that the Trustee does not have an affirmative duty to ascertain whether or not any such directions are unduly prejudicial to such Holders) or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification or security satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all costs, fees, damages, losses, liabilities or expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture provides that if a Default or an Event of Default occurs and is continuing and a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice of such Default or Event of Default, the Trustee must send to each Holder notice of the Default or Event of Default within 90 days after a responsible officer of the Trustee has received such written notice. Except in the case of an Event of Default in the payment of principal of, or premium (if any) or interest on or Additional Amounts, if any, with respect to, any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as it, in good faith, determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. In addition, the Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, a certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default occurring during the previous year. The Company also is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any event that would constitute certain Defaults or Events of Default, their status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.",N/A,as_expected,2024,138

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed supplement, amendment or waiver. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed supplement, amendment or waiver. Until a supplement, amendment or waiver becomes effective, a consent to it by a Holder is a continuing consent by such Holder and every subsequent Holder of all or part of the related Note. Any such Holder or subsequent holder may revoke such consent as to its Note by written notice to the Trustee or the Company, received thereby before the date on which the Company certifies to the Trustee that the Holders of the requisite principal amount of Notes have consented to such supplement, amendment or waiver. After a supplement, amendment or waiver under the Indenture becomes effective, the Company is required to mail to Holders a notice briefly describing such supplement, amendment or waiver. However, the failure to give such notice to all Holders, or any defect therein, will not impair or affect the validity of the supplement, amendment or waiver. The Trustee shall sign any amendment, supplement or waiver authorized pursuant to the Indenture if the amendment or supplement does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee. In executing any amendment, supplement or waiver, the Trustee shall receive and shall be fully protected in relying upon an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such amended or supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by the Indenture and that such amendment, supplement or waiver is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Issuer and any Guarantors party thereto, enforceable against them in accordance with its terms, subject to customary exceptions, and complies with the provisions of the Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2024,138

We believe, however, that it is currently the policy of Euroclear and Clearstream to immediately credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with such payments, in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the relevant security as shown on the records Euroclear and Clearstream, as the case may be. Payments by the depositary’s participants and the depositary’s indirect participants to the beneficial owners of the Notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary practice and will be the responsibility of the depositary’s participants or the depositary’s indirect participants. Notes in definitive, fully registered form will be issued and delivered to each person that the depositary identifies as a beneficial owner of the related Note only if (1) Euroclear or Clearstream notifies us in writing that it is no longer willing or able to act as a depositary, and we are unable to locate a qualified successor within 90 days or (2) we, at our option upon a change in Tax law that would be adverse to us but for the issuance of Notes in definitive, fully registered form, notify the Trustee in writing that we elect to cause the issuance of the Notes in definitive form under the Indenture. Neither we nor the Trustee will be liable for any delay by the Global Note Holder, Euroclear or Clearstream in identifying the beneficial owners of the applicable Notes, and we and the Trustee may conclusively rely on, and will be protected in relying on, instructions from only the Global Note Holder, Euroclear or Clearstream, for all purposes. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,138

Generally, a holder of securities in a company is considered to hold a substantial interest in such company, if such holder alone or, in the case of individuals, together with such holder’s partner for Dutch income tax purposes, or any relatives by blood or marriage in the direct line (including foster children), directly or indirectly, holds (i) an interest of 5% or more of the total issued and outstanding capital of that company or of 5% or more of the issued and outstanding capital of a certain class of shares of that company; or (ii) rights to acquire, directly or indirectly, such interest; or (iii) certain profit sharing rights in that company that relate to 5% or more of the company’s annual profits or to 5% or more of the company’s liquidation proceeds. A deemed substantial interest may arise if a substantial interest (or part thereof) in a company has been disposed of, or is deemed to have been disposed of, on a non-recognition basis; (ii) pension funds, investment institutions (fiscale beleggingsinstelingen), exempt investment institutions (vrijgestelde beleggingsinstellingen) (each as defined in the Dutch Corporate Income Tax Act 1969; Wet op _de vennootschapsbelasting 1969) and other entities that are, in whole or in part, not subject to or exempt_ from Dutch corporate income tax; and (iii) holders of Notes who are individuals for whom the Notes or any benefit derived from the Notes are a remuneration or deemed to be a remuneration for activities performed by such holders or certain individuals related to such holders (as defined in the Dutch Income Tax Act 2001). _Dutch Resident Entities_ Generally, if the holder of Notes is an entity that is a resident or deemed to be resident of the Netherlands for Dutch corporate income tax purposes (a “Dutch Resident Entity”), any income derived or deemed to be derived from the Notes or any capital gains realized on the disposal or deemed disposal of the Notes is subject to Dutch corporate income tax at a rate of 19% with respect to taxable profits up to €200,000 and 25.8% with respect to taxable profits in excess of that amount (rates and brackets for 2024). _Dutch Resident Individuals_ If the holder of Notes is an individual, resident or deemed to be resident of the Netherlands for Dutch income tax purposes (a “Dutch Resident Individual”), any income derived or deemed to be derived from the Notes or any capital gains realized on the disposal or deemed disposal of the Notes is subject to Dutch personal income tax at the progressive rates (with a maximum of 49.5% in 2024), if: (i) the Notes are attributable to an enterprise from which the holder of Notes derives a share of the profit, whether as an entrepreneur (ondernemer) or as a person who has a co-entitlement to the net worth (medegerechtigd tot het vermogen) of such enterprise without being a shareholder (as defined in the Dutch Income Tax Act 2001); or ----- (ii) the holder of Notes is considered to perform activities with respect to the Notes that go beyond ordinary asset management (normaal, actief vermogensbeheer) or otherwise derives benefits from the Notes that are taxable as benefits from miscellaneous activities (resultaat uit overige werkzaamheden). _Taxation of savings and investments_ If the above-mentioned conditions (i) and (ii) do not apply to the Dutch Resident Individual, the Notes will be subject to an annual Dutch income tax under the regime for savings and investments (inkomen uit sparen en _beleggen). Taxation only occurs insofar as the Dutch Resident Individual’s net investment assets for the year exceed_ a statutory threshold (heffingvrij vermogen). The net investment assets for the year are the fair market value of the investment assets less the fair market value of the liabilities on January 1 of the relevant calendar year (reference date; peildatum). Actual income or capital gains realized in respect of the Notes are as such not subject to Dutch income tax. The Dutch Resident Individual’s assets and liabilities taxed under this regime, including the Notes, are allocated over the following three categories: (a) bank savings (banktegoeden), (b) other investments (overige bezittingen), including the Notes, and (c) liabilities (schulden). The taxable benefit for the year (voordeel uit sparen en beleggen) is equal to the product of (x) the total deemed return divided by the sum of bank savings, other investments and liabilities and (y) the sum of bank savings, other investments and liabilities minus the statutory threshold, and is taxed at a flat rate of 36% (rate for 2024). The deemed return applicable to other investments, including the Notes, is set at 6.04% for calendar year 2024. Transactions in the three-month period before and after January 1 of the relevant calendar year that are implemented to arbitrate between the deemed return percentages applicable to bank savings, other investments and liabilities will for this purpose be ignored if the holder of Notes cannot sufficiently demonstrate that such transactions are implemented other than for tax reasons. The current Dutch income tax regime for savings and investments was implemented in Dutch tax law following the decision of the Dutch Supreme Court (Hoge Raad) of December 24, 2021 (ECLI:NL:2021:1963) (the “Decision”). In the Decision, the Dutch Supreme Court ruled that the (old) system of taxation for savings and investments based on a deemed return may under specific circumstances contravene with Section 1 of the First Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights in combination with Section 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights (the “EC-Human Rights”). A new court procedure is pending before the Dutch Supreme Court questioning whether the current tax system for savings and investments is in line with the Decision. On September 18, 2023 (ECLI:NL:PHR:2023:655), Attorney General Wattel concluded that the new tax system is not in line with the Decision, except for the taxation of bank savings, as the system is, in short, still based on a deemed return rather than actual returns, and as a result, the regime violates the EC-Human Rights. The decision of the Dutch Supreme Court is expected mid-2024. In addition, on September 8, 2023, the outgoing (demissionair) cabinet published a law proposal for a new tax system for savings and investments on the basis of actual returns according to an asset accumulation system, known as the “Actual Return Box 3 Act” (Wet werkelijk rendement box 3). The proposed system is expected to come into effect on January 1, 2027 at the earliest. Holders of Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisors to ensure that the tax in respect of the Notes is levied in accordance with applicable Dutch tax rules at the relevant time. _Non-residents of the Netherlands_ A holder of Notes that is neither a Dutch Resident Entity nor a Dutch Resident Individual will not be subject to Dutch income tax in respect of income derived or deemed to be derived from the Notes or in respect of capital gains realized on the disposal or deemed disposal of the Notes, provided that: (i) such holder does not have an interest in an enterprise or deemed enterprise (as defined in the Dutch Income Tax Act 2001 and the Dutch Corporate Income Tax Act 1969, as applicable) which, in whole or in part, is either effectively managed in the Netherlands or carried on through a permanent establishment, a deemed permanent establishment or a permanent representative in the Netherlands and to which enterprise or part of an enterprise the Notes are attributable; and ----- (ii) in the event the holder is an individual, such holder does not carry out any activities in the Netherlands with respect to the Notes that go beyond ordinary asset management and does not otherwise derive benefits from the Notes that are taxable as benefits from miscellaneous activities in the Netherlands.",N/A,as_expected,2024,138

For purposes of this paragraph, the “Group” means the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries. On April 3, 2020, the Swiss Federal Council published draft legislation on the reform of the Swiss withholding tax system applicable to interest payments on bonds. This draft legislation provided for, among other things, the replacement of the current debtor-based regime applicable to interest payments on bonds with a paying agent-based regime for Swiss withholding tax. Under such proposed paying agent-based regime, subject to certain exceptions, all interest payments made on bonds by paying agents acting out of Switzerland to individuals resident in Switzerland would have been subject to Swiss withholding tax, including any such interest payments made on bonds issued by entities organized in a jurisdiction outside Switzerland (such as interest payments on the Notes). Due to the controversial outcome of the consultation on the draft legislation, the Swiss Federal Council submitted new draft legislation to the Swiss Parliament that provided for the abolition of Swiss withholding tax on interest payments on bonds. This legislation was accepted by the Swiss Parliament, but was rejected in a referendum held on September 25, 2022. In view of the rejection of this legislation, the Swiss Federal Council could again propose a paying agentbased regime as contemplated by the draft legislation published on April 3, 2020. If such a proposal were to be accepted and enacted and were to result in the deduction or withholding of Swiss withholding tax on any interest payments under a Note (or in respect of any payment under a Guarantee in respect thereof), neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor would, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Notes or the Guarantees, respectively, be obliged to pay any additional amounts with respect to such payments as a result of such deduction or withholding of Swiss withholding tax.",N/A,as_expected,2024,138

Consequently, in the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency event with respect to the Parent Guarantor or one of its subsidiaries, primary proceedings could be initiated in Switzerland. Swiss insolvency laws may make it difficult or impossible to effect a restructuring and the insolvency laws of Switzerland may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you may be familiar. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Switzerland. In the event that the Parent Guarantor or any of its Swiss subsidiaries (including the Swiss Subsidiary Guarantor) experienced financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Under Swiss insolvency law, there is no group insolvency concept, which means there is no consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency. In case of a group of companies, each entity has, from a Swiss insolvency law point of view, to be dealt with separately. As a consequence, there is, in particular, no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, but rather claims of and vis-à-vis each entity have to be dealt with separately. Pursuant to Swiss insolvency laws, your ability to receive payment under the Notes may be more limited than would be the case under non-Swiss bankruptcy laws. Under Swiss law, the following types of proceedings (altogether referred to as insolvency proceedings) may be opened against an entity having its registered office or assets in Switzerland. In the event of a Swiss entity’s insolvency, the respective insolvency proceedings would be governed by Swiss law as a result of such Swiss entity’s offices being registered in the competent commercial register in Switzerland. The enforcement of claims and questions relating to insolvency and bankruptcy in general are dealt with by the Swiss Federal Act on Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy, as amended from time to time. Under these rules, claims that are pursued against a Swiss entity can lead to the opening of bankruptcy (Konkurs) and, hence, a general liquidation of all assets, even if located outside Switzerland, and liabilities of the debtor. However, with regard to assets located outside Switzerland, a Swiss bankruptcy decree may only be enforceable if it is recognized at the place where such assets are located. If bankruptcy has not been declared, creditors secured by a pledge must follow an individual debt enforcement proceeding limited to the liquidation of the collateral (Betreibung auf _Pfandverwertung) unless the parties have agreed that the creditor shall have the right to a private realization (private Verwertung) of the pledge._ However, if bankruptcy is declared while such an individual debt enforcement proceeding is pending, the proceeding ceases and the creditor participates in the bankruptcy proceedings with the other creditors and an individual debt enforcement proceeding is no longer permitted. As a rule, the opening of bankruptcy by the competent court needs to be preceded by a prior debt enforcement procedure which involves, inter alia, the issuance of a payment summons (Zahlungsbefehl) by local debt enforcement authorities (Betreibungsamt). However, the competent court may also declare a debtor bankrupt without such prior proceedings if the following requirements are met: (i) at the request of the debtor, if the debtor’s board of directors or the auditors of the company (in case of failure of the board of directors) declare that the debtor is over-indebted (überschuldet) within the meaning of art. 725b of the Swiss Code of Obligations (or the corresponding provision of the Swiss Code of Obligations in case of a limited liability company (GmbH)) or if it declares to be insolvent (zahlungsunfähig); and (ii) at the request of a creditor, if the debtor commits certain acts to the detriment of its creditors or ceases to make payments (Zahlungseinstellung) or in certain events during composition proceedings. The bankruptcy proceedings are carried out and the bankrupt estate is managed by the receiver in bankruptcy (Konkursverwaltung). All assets owned by the relevant debtor at the time of the declaration of bankruptcy and all assets acquired or received subsequently form the bankrupt estate which, after deduction of costs and certain other expenses, is used to satisfy the creditors. Final distribution of non-secured claims is based on a ranking of creditors in three classes. The first and the second class, which are privileged, comprise certain claims under employment contracts, accident insurance, pension plans, employee social plans, family law and certain deposits under the Swiss Federal Banking ----- Act. Certain privileges can also be claimed by the Swiss government and its subdivisions based on specific provisions of Swiss Federal law. All other creditors are treated equally in the third class. A secured party participates in the third class to the extent its claim is (i) not covered by its collateral and (ii) not privileged, as described in the immediately preceding sentences. Upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings (Konkurseröffnung), the right to administer and dispose over the business and the assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency office (Konkursamt). The insolvency office has full administrative and disposal authority over the debtor’s estate (Konkursmasse), provided that certain acts require the approval of the insolvency court. The creditors’ meeting may appoint a private insolvency administration (private Konkursverwaltung) and, in addition, a creditors’ committee (Gläubigerausschuss). In such case, the private insolvency administration will be competent to maintain and liquidate the debtor’s estate. The creditors’ committee has additional competences. Insolvency results in the acceleration of all claims against a debtor (secured or unsecured), except for those secured by a mortgage on the debtor’s real property, and the relevant claims become due upon the opening of formal bankruptcy proceedings (Konkurseröffnung). As a result of such acceleration, a creditor’s bankruptcy claim consists of the principal amount of the debt (discounted at 5% if not interest bearing), interest accrued thereon until the date of insolvency and (limited) costs of enforcement. Upon insolvency, interest ceases to accrue. Only secured claims enjoy a preferential treatment insofar as interest that would have accrued until the collateral is realized will be honored if and to such extent as the proceeds of the collateral suffice to cover such interests. All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a segregation right (Aussonderungsrecht)), wishing to assert claims against the debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings. Swiss insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with the restrictions of Swiss insolvency laws. Therefore, secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce any security interest outside of insolvency proceedings. In an insolvency proceeding, however, secured creditors have certain preferential rights (Vorzugsrechte). Generally, entitlement to realize such security is vested with the insolvency administration. Realization proceedings are governed by Swiss insolvency laws which provide for a public auction, or, subject to certain conditions, a private sale. Proceeds from enforcement are used to cover (i) enforcement costs, (ii) the claims of the secured creditors and (iii) any excess proceeds will be used to satisfy unsecured creditors. Typically, liabilities resulting from acts of the insolvency administrator after commencement of formal insolvency proceedings constitute liabilities of the debtor’s estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten). Thereafter, all other claims (insolvency claims—Konkursforderungen), in particular claims of unsecured creditors, will be satisfied pursuant to the distribution provisions of Swiss insolvency laws, which provide for certain privileged classes of creditors, as set out above. All other creditors will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there are funds remaining in the debtor’s estate (Konkursmasse) after the liabilities of the debtor’s estate as well as the security interests and privileged claims have been settled and paid in full. Swiss insolvency laws also provide for reorganization procedures by composition with the debtor’s creditors. Reorganization is initiated by a request with the competent court for a temporary moratorium (provisorische _Nachlassstundung) of a maximum duration of four months (and a possibility to extend for another four months,_ subject to certain conditions). During the moratorium, the debtor can seek to restructure and, if successful, ask the court to lift the moratorium without entering into a composition agreement. The moratorium can also result in a composition agreement which takes the form of (i) either an ordinary composition agreement (ordentlicher _Nachlassvertrag) where the debtor’s business continues and the contractual terms of its payment obligations are_ modified (Stundungsvergleich) or creditors receive a dividend (Dividendenvergleich) or (ii) a composition agreement providing for the assignment of assets (Nachlassvertrag mit Vermögensabtretung) where the debtor’s assets are assigned to creditors in order to sell the debtor’s (or part of it) or to liquidate the assets. The moratorium could also result in a composition agreement that may comprise the formation of a new company (Auffanggesellschaft) to receive part of the business of the debtor. During a moratorium, debt collection proceedings, and as a rule, individual debt enforcement proceedings to liquidate collateral, cannot be initiated and pending debt collection proceedings are stayed (although a secured creditor may have to take, during a moratorium, certain actions to safeguard its rights in connection with any individual debt enforcement proceeding initiated before the moratorium). ----- In principle, interest ceases to accrue against the debtor for all unsecured claims. Furthermore, the debtor’s power to dispose of its assets and to manage its affairs is restricted. The moratorium does not per se affect the agreed due dates of debts (contrary to bankruptcy, in which case all debts become immediately due upon adjudication). Any composition agreement needs to be approved by the creditors and confirmed by the competent court. With the judicial confirmation, the composition agreement becomes binding on all creditors, whereby secured claims are only subject to the composition agreement to the extent that the collateral proves to be insufficient to cover the secured claims. Under Swiss insolvency laws, the insolvency administration and certain creditors may, under certain conditions, avoid transactions, such as, inter alia, the granting of or the payment under any guarantee and/or security or, if a payment has already been made under the relevant guarantee or security, require that the recipients return the amount received to the debtor’s estate (Konkursmasse). In particular, a transaction (which term includes the granting of a guarantee, the provision of security and the payment of debt) detrimental to the debtor’s other creditors may be avoided according to Swiss insolvency laws in the following cases if such acts result in damages to the creditors: - The debtor has made a transaction being considered as a gift or a disposal of assets without any consideration, provided that the debtor made such transaction within the last year prior to the opening of formal insolvency proceedings (Konkurseröffnung) or the confirmation of a composition agreement with assignment of assets (Nachlassvertrag mit Vermögensabtretung). Similarly, transactions pursuant to which the debtor received a consideration which was disproportionate to its own performance, may be avoided. In case the beneficiary of the relevant transaction with the debtor is a related party, including without limitation a group company, the burden of proof is shifted to the beneficiary of such transaction, who must in this case prove that such transaction was at arm’s length. - Certain acts are voidable if performed by the debtor within the last year prior to the opening of formal insolvency proceedings (Konkurseröffnung) or the confirmation of a composition agreement with assignment of assets (Nachlassvertrag mit Vermögensabtretung), provided that the debtor was already over-indebted at that time: (i) granting of security for existing claims, provided that the debtor was not previously obliged to grant such security, (ii) payment of a monetary obligation (Geldschuld) in any other way than by payment in cash (Barschaft) or other customary means of payment, and (iii) the payment of a debt not yet due. However, any avoidance action is dismissed if the beneficiary of the transaction can prove that it was not aware of the debtor’s over-indebtedness and, being diligent, could not know that the debtor had been over-indebted at that time. - Furthermore, any acts performed within the last five years prior to, inter alia, the opening of formal insolvency proceedings (Konkurseröffnung) or the confirmation of a composition agreement with assignment of assets (Nachlassvertrag mit Vermögensabtretung) performed by the debtor with the intention to discriminate some creditors against others or to favor some creditors to others are voidable if such intention was known, or when exercising the requisite due diligence must have been known, to the debtor’s counterparty. In case the beneficiary of the relevant transaction with the debtor is a related party, including without limitation a group company, the burden of proof is shifted to the beneficiary of such transaction, who must in this case prove that such intention was not recognizable. If any guarantee or security is avoided as summarized above or held unenforceable for any other reason, the claimant would cease to have any claim in respect of the guarantee (or any security interest, as the case may be) and would have a claim solely under the Notes and the remaining guarantees, if any. Any amounts obtained from transactions that have been avoided would have to be repaid.",N/A,as_expected,2024,138
107_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,22,CERTAIN TAXATION CONSIDERATIONS,22.4,Guarantees by Guarantors incorporated in Switzerland,22.4.1,,"The granting of guarantees by Guarantors incorporated in Switzerland (each a “Swiss Guarantor” and collectively, the “Swiss Guarantors”) as well as any other undertaking contained in any agreement having the same or a similar effect, such as, but not limited to, the waiver of set-off or subrogation rights or the subordination of intra-group claims, granted by the Swiss Guarantor for the benefit of the Swiss Guarantor’s direct and indirect parent and sister companies are subject to certain restrictions on the distribution of corporate assets under Swiss corporate law. These Swiss rules regarding capital maintenance, including but not limited to articles 671(1) to (4), 675(2) and 680(2) of the Swiss Code of Obligations (or the corresponding provisions of the Swiss Code of Obligations in case of a limited liability company (GmbH)), prohibit the direct or indirect repayment of a Swiss ----- stock corporation’s (Aktiengesellschaft) share capital and legal reserves to its shareholders and restrict the distribution of a Swiss stock corporation’s accrued earnings to its shareholders. Therefore, in order to enable the Swiss Guarantors to grant guarantees guaranteeing liabilities of the Issuer without the risk of violating such restrictions and to protect management from personal liability, it is standard market practice for guarantees and other respective documents to contain so-called “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries incorporated in Switzerland in the form of a Swiss stock corporation (or Swiss limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung),_ respectively). Pursuant to such limitation language, the enforcement of the guarantee granted by each of the Swiss Guarantors will be limited reflecting the requirement that payments under the Guarantee may not cause the Swiss Guarantor to incur a liability which would exceed its freely distributable equity at the time of the enforcement of the Guarantee. The freely distributable equity is equal to the maximum amount which the relevant Swiss Guarantor can distribute to its shareholders as a dividend payment under Swiss law at that point in time. These limitations apply in relation to guarantees or security interests securing the performance of any obligations of any (direct or indirect) shareholder and/or any sister company of a Swiss Guarantor. If the issuance of a Guarantee by a Swiss Guarantor or the performance by a Swiss Guarantor of obligations under a Guarantee is classified as a conveyance of an economic benefit by such Guarantor to the Issuer (except where the Issuer is a direct or indirect subsidiary of a Guarantor) for which the Swiss Guarantor has not received or will not receive adequate compensation in exchange therefor, then such Swiss Guarantor may, at the time of issuance of the Guarantee or performance of obligations under the Guarantee, be required to deduct Swiss withholding tax of 35% on any actual or constructive dividend distribution resulting from such conveyance of an economic benefit. The guarantees by the Swiss Guarantors are, based on a choice of law, subject to the laws of New York. Should a Swiss court accept jurisdiction in proceedings on the merits, a Swiss court will generally recognize a choice of law of the contracting parties. The scope of such choice of law is, however, usually limited to the rules of the substantive law chosen by the parties; as to procedural matters, a Swiss court will apply Swiss procedural law. Due to the different nature of Swiss procedural law and the procedural law in common law jurisdictions (such as the United States of America and the United Kingdom) classification and delimitation issues between substantive and procedural law could occur. To establish the non-Swiss substantive law applicable to the merits, a Swiss court may, in pecuniary matters, request the parties to establish the non-Swiss substantive law; Swiss law will be applied, if the content of the foreign substantive law cannot be established. While a Swiss court will generally accept a choice of law, restrictively applied exceptions exist: Swiss courts may diverge from the chosen substantive law if such chosen law would lead to a result contrary to Swiss public policy, if the purpose of mandatory rules of Swiss law require, by their special aim, immediate application, or if the purpose of mandatory rules of another law, to which the dispute is closely connected, are considered legitimate under Swiss legal concepts and, upon weighing the interests of the parties involved, the clearly predominant interest(s) of one party so require. Foreign bankruptcy decrees issued in the country of a debtor’s domicile may be recognized in Switzerland only, provided that (i) the bankruptcy decree is enforceable in the country where it was issued, (ii) its recognition is, inter _alia, not against Swiss public policy and (iii) the country which issued the bankruptcy decree grants reciprocity to_ Switzerland.",N/A,as_expected,2024,138

Consequently, in the event of its insolvency, insolvency proceedings with respect to the Issuer or the Dutch Subsidiary Guarantor may be initiated under, and be governed by, Dutch insolvency law. The insolvency laws of the Netherlands and, in particular, the provisions of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet) may be less favorable to your interests as creditors than the bankruptcy laws of other jurisdictions with which you may be familiar, including in respect of priority of creditors, the ability to obtain postpetition interest or to effect a restructuring, and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and may limit the ability of the holders of Notes to enforce the terms of the Guarantee granted by the Dutch Subsidiary Guarantor. Thus, your ----- ability to recover payments due on the Notes may be more limited than it might have been under the laws of other jurisdictions with which you may be familiar. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of the Netherlands. There are three primary insolvency regimes under Dutch law: the first, moratorium of payments (surseance van _betaling), is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s indebtedness and enable the debtor to continue as a_ going concern. The second, the out-of-court restructuring plan (onderhands akkoord) procedure, is also intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s debt and enable the debtor to continue as a going concern. The third, bankruptcy (faillissement), is primarily designed to liquidate and distribute the proceeds of the assets of a debtor to its creditors. Such liquidation, however, may take place by way of a going concern sale. The moratorium of payments and bankruptcy are set forth in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet). The out-of-court restructuring plan, also known as the Dutch Scheme, is set forth in the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans (Wet homologatie onderhands akkoord) (the “WHOA”). Creditors will solely by reason of claims under the Notes or the guarantee granted by a Dutch company not qualify as secured creditors under Dutch bankruptcy law. In practice, bankruptcy proceedings may also be used to sell the business, or parts of the business, as a going concern. As such, a bankruptcy could function as a restructuring procedure as well as a liquidation procedure. A general description of the principles of the insolvency regimes are set out below.",N/A,as_expected,2024,138
107_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,22,CERTAIN TAXATION CONSIDERATIONS,22.5,Dutch Legal Considerations,22.5.2,Moratorium of Payments,"A moratorium of payments is a court-ordered general suspension of a debtor’s obligations to its creditors. An application for a moratorium of payments can only be made by the debtor itself and only if it foresees its inability to continue to pay its debts as they fall due. Once the application for a moratorium of payments is filed, the Dutch court will immediately (dadelijk) grant a provisional moratorium and appoint one or more administrators (bewindvoerders). The debtor is only entitled to administer and dispose of his assets with the consent of the administrator. A meeting of creditors is required to decide on the definitive moratorium. If a draft composition (ontwerp-akkoord) is filed simultaneously with the application for moratorium of payments, the Dutch court can order that the composition will be processed before a decision about a definitive moratorium. If the composition is accepted and subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the Dutch court, the provisional moratorium ends. The definitive moratorium will generally be granted unless a qualified minority (more than one-quarter in amount of claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or more than one-third in number of creditors represented at such creditors’ meeting) of the unsecured non-preferential creditors withholds its consent or if there is a valid fear that the debtor will try to prejudice the creditors during a moratorium of payments or if there is no prospect that the debtor will in the future be able to pay its debts as they fall due (in which case the debtor will generally be declared bankrupt). The moratorium of payments only affects unsecured non-preferential creditors. A moratorium takes effect retroactively from 12:00 a.m. on the day on which the court has granted the provisional suspension of payments. Consequently, Dutch insolvency laws could preclude or inhibit the ability of the holders of Notes to effect a restructuring and could reduce the recovery of a holder of Notes in Dutch moratorium of payments proceedings. Interest payments that fall due after the date on which a moratorium of payments is granted cannot be claimed in a composition.",N/A,as_expected,2024,138
107_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,22,CERTAIN TAXATION CONSIDERATIONS,22.5,Dutch Legal Considerations,22.5.3,Dutch Scheme,"With the entry into force of the WHOA on January 1, 2021, debtors have the possibility to offer a composition outside of formal insolvency proceedings. Unlike a composition in suspension of payments and in bankruptcy proceedings, a composition under the WHOA can be offered to secured creditors as well as shareholders. The WHOA provides, inter alia, for cross class cramdown, the restructuring of group company obligations through aligned proceedings, the termination of onerous contracts, the suspension of certain ipso facto clauses in contracts and supporting court measures. A WHOA composition may result in claims against the Issuer and the Dutch Subsidiary Guarantor being compromised if the relevant majority votes in favor of such a composition and it is subsequently confirmed by the Dutch courts. A composition plan under the WHOA can extend to claims against entities that are not incorporated under Dutch law and/or are residing outside the Netherlands. Accordingly, the WHOA can affect the rights of the Trustee and/or the holders of the Notes under the Indenture and therefore the Notes. ----- Voting on a WHOA composition plan is done in classes. A class is deemed to accept the plan if two-thirds of the total amount of the debt of that class or, in the case of a class of shareholders, two-thirds of the share capital of that class, participating in the vote, votes in favor. The WHOA provides for the possibility for a composition plan to be binding on a dissenting class (i.e., cross-class cramdown). Under the WHOA, the court will confirm a composition plan if at least one class of creditors (other than a class of shareholders) that can be expected to receive a distribution in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor approves the plan, unless there is a statutory ground for refusal. The court can, inter alia, refuse confirmation of a composition plan on the basis of (i) a request by a dissenting creditor, if the value of the distribution that such creditor receives under the plan is lower than the distribution it can be expected to receive in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor or (ii) a request of a dissenting creditor in a dissenting class, if the plan provides for a distribution of value that deviates from the statutory or contractual ranking and priority to the detriment of that class, unless there is a reasonable ground to do so. There is one mandatory refusal ground specifically applicable to secured financial creditors. If the composition plan entails a debt-for-equity swap to which such creditors do not want to ascribe, and these creditors do not have the right to opt for a different kind of distribution, the court will refuse confirmation of such plan on the request of such creditor. Under the WHOA, the court may grant a stay on enforcement of a maximum of four months, with a possible extension of four months. For the duration of such moratorium, all enforcement action against the assets of (or in the possession of) the debtor is suspended unless with the court’s approval, including action to enforce security over the assets of the debtor or, in case of an undisclosed right of pledge over receivables, the collection or notification to the debtors. Furthermore, any petitions for bankruptcy in respect of the debtor are suspended and the court may lift attachments on the debtor’s assets at the request of the debtor or restructuring expert. The WHOA could therefore have an adverse effect on the ability of the holders of the Notes to recover payments due on the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2024,138
107_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,22,CERTAIN TAXATION CONSIDERATIONS,22.5,Dutch Legal Considerations,22.5.4,Bankruptcy,"At the request of the debtor itself, the public prosecutor (if the public interest so requires) or one or more of its creditors, the Dutch court may open bankruptcy proceedings in respect of a debtor that has ceased to pay its debts. A debtor is considered to have ceased paying its debts if claims of at least two creditors for payments due remain unpaid. If bankruptcy is declared by the Dutch court, the court will appoint a receiver (curator) who is entrusted with the administration of the bankruptcy. The bankrupt debtor loses the right to administer and dispose of its assets. A bankruptcy order takes effect retroactively from 12:00 a.m. on the day the order is rendered. The receiver in bankruptcy manages the bankrupt estate, which consists of all of the debtor’s assets and liabilities that exist on the date on which the bankruptcy order became final, and of all assets acquired during the bankruptcy. The bankruptcy estate is not liable for obligations incurred by the debtor after the bankruptcy order, except to the extent that such obligations arise from transactions that are beneficial to the estate. Under Dutch bankruptcy proceedings, the assets of a debtor are generally liquidated and the proceeds distributed to the debtor’s creditors in accordance with the respective rank and priority of their claims. The general principle of Dutch bankruptcy law is the so-called paritas _creditorum (principle of equal treatment) which means that all creditors have an equal right to payment and that the_ proceeds of bankruptcy proceedings shall be distributed in proportion to the size of their claims. However, certain creditors (such as secured creditors and tax and social security authorities) will have special rights that take priority over the rights of other creditors, which may adversely affect the interests of (non-preferential) holders of Notes. For example, in a Dutch bankruptcy secured creditors may take recourse against the encumbered assets of a debtor to satisfy their claims as if there is no bankruptcy. Consequently, Dutch insolvency laws could reduce the potential recovery of a holder of Notes in Dutch bankruptcy proceedings. The claim of a creditor may be limited depending on the date the claim becomes due and payable in accordance with its terms. Generally, claims of the holders of Notes that are not due and payable by their terms on the date of a bankruptcy of the Dutch Subsidiary Guarantor will be accelerated and become due and payable as of that date. Each of these claims will have to be submitted to the receiver to be verified. “Verification” under Dutch law means that the receiver determines the value of the claim and whether and to what extent it will be admitted in the bankruptcy proceedings. The valuation of claims that are not due and payable at the time of the opening of the bankruptcy proceedings or within one year thereafter, is based on a net present value analysis. Interest payments that fall due after the date of the bankruptcy cannot be verified. The existence, value and ranking of any claims submitted by the holders of Notes may be challenged in the Dutch bankruptcy proceedings. Generally, in a creditors’ meeting (verificatievergadering), the receiver, the insolvent debtor and all verified creditors may dispute the verification of claims of other creditors. Creditors whose claims or value thereof are disputed in the creditors’ meeting may be referred to separate court proceedings (renvooi procedures). Such ----- proceedings could also cause payments to the holders of Notes to be delayed compared with holders of undisputed claims. As in moratorium of payments proceedings, in a bankruptcy a composition may be offered to creditors, which shall be binding on unsecured non-preferential creditors if (i) it is approved by a simple majority of the meeting of unsecured non-preferential creditors, with admitted and provisionally admitted claims representing at least 50% of the total amount of the admitted and provisionally admitted unsecured non-preferential claims, and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the Dutch court. Upon request by the debtor or the receiver, the supervisory judge can decide to adopt the proposed but rejected composition as if it were approved if (i) three-fourths the number of the creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting approved the composition and (ii) the rejection of the composition is caused by one or more creditors such that, taking all circumstances into consideration, especially the percentage of the claim that such creditor(s) would receive in case the estate is liquidated and distributed, such creditor(s) reasonably could not have voted against the composition. The Dutch Bankruptcy Act does not in itself recognize the concept of classes of creditors. Remaining amounts, if any, after satisfaction of the secured and the preferential creditors are distributed among the unsecured non-preferential creditors, who will be satisfied on a pro rata basis. Contractual subordination may to a certain extent be given effect in Dutch insolvency proceedings. The actual effect depends largely on the way such subordination is construed. Interest payments that fall due on or after the date on which the bankruptcy proceedings are opened cannot be verified in the bankruptcy. The proceeds resulting from the liquidation of the bankrupt estate may not be available for distribution for several years and may be insufficient to satisfy unsecured creditors.",N/A,as_expected,2024,138

Simultaneously with the opening of the bankruptcy, a Dutch receiver will be appointed.

In determining whether the granting of such guarantee is in the interest of the relevant company, the Dutch courts would not only consider the text of the objects clause in the articles of association of the company but all relevant circumstances, including whether the company derives certain commercial benefits from the transaction in respect of which the guarantee was granted. The objects clauses in the articles of association of the Dutch Subsidiary Guarantor include the issuance of guarantees in favor of group companies and third parties. ----- In addition, if it is determined that there are no, or insufficient, commercial benefits from the transactions for the company that grants the guarantee, then such company (and any bankruptcy receiver) may contest the enforcement of the guarantee, and it is possible that such challenge would be successful. Such benefit may, according to Dutch case law, consist of an indirect benefit derived by the company as a consequence of the interdependence of such company with the group of companies to which it belongs. In addition, it is relevant whether, as a consequence of the granting of the guarantee, the continuity of such company would foreseeably be endangered by the granting of such guarantee. It remains possible that even if such strong financial and commercial interdependence exists, the transaction may be declared void if it appears that the granting of the guarantee cannot serve the realization of the relevant company’s objects or where it is determined that there is a material imbalance to the disadvantage of the company between the commercial benefit, on the one hand, and the risk, on the other hand. The above also applies with respect to any security interest granted or other legal act entered into by a Dutch company. Whether or not a guarantor is insolvent in the Netherlands, pursuant to Dutch law, payment under a guarantee may be withheld under the doctrines of reasonableness and fairness (redelijkheid en billijkheid), force majeure and unforeseen circumstances (onvoorziene omstandigheden). If Dutch law applies, a guarantee governed by Dutch law may be voided by a Dutch court, if the document was executed through undue influence (misbruik van omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog), duress (bedreiging) or mistake (dwaling) of a party to the agreement contained in that document. In addition, a guarantee issued by a Dutch company may be suspended or avoided by the Enterprise Chamber of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam (Ondernemingskamer van het Gerechtshof te Amsterdam) on the motion of the holder or holders of 10% or more of the shares in such company.

When considering an investment in the Notes with a portion of the assets of any Benefit Plan Investor or NonERISA Plan Investor, a fiduciary should determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Benefit Plan Investor or Non-ERISA Plan Investor and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Laws relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Benefit Plan Investor or Non-ERISA Plan Investor, including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws. In addition, Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit Benefit Plan Investors from engaging in specified transactions involving “plan assets” of Benefit Plan Investors with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of ERISA, or “disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption is available and all requirements thereunder are satisfied. The Issuer, the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates (collectively, the “Transaction Parties”) may be parties in interest or disqualified persons with respect to certain Benefit Plan Investors, and, where this is the case, the acquisition or holding of Notes by or on behalf of a Benefit Plan Investor may constitute or result in a prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code unless a statutory or administrative exemption applies. Fiduciaries and other persons (including parties in interest or disqualified persons) involved in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and other liabilities under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, and the prohibited transaction may need to be rescinded or otherwise corrected. There are statutory or administrative exemptions that could apply, depending on the circumstances, to provide relief from certain of the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code in connection with the acquisition or holding of Notes, including, but not limited to: Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption (“PTCE”) 84-14 a (applicable to a “qualified professional asset manager”); PTCE 90-1 (applicable to insurance company separate accounts); PTCE 91-38 (applicable to bank collective investment funds); PTCE 95-60 (applicable to insurance company general accounts); and PTCE 96-23 (applicable to an “in-house asset manager”). In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code generally exempt certain transactions with a person that is a party in interest or disqualified person to a Benefit Plan Investor solely by reason of it or its affiliate providing services to the Benefit Plan Investor, provided that such services are not in a fiduciary capacity within the meaning of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code in connection with the investment of “plan assets” of the Benefit Plan Investor involved in the transaction, and the Benefit Plan Investor pays no more than, and receives no less than, “adequate consideration” in connection with the transaction. There can be no assurance that any prohibited transaction exemption will apply to the acquisition or holding, or subsequent transfer or other disposition, of Notes by any particular Benefit Plan Investor or, even if all of the conditions specified therein were satisfied, that the exemption would apply to all prohibited transactions that may occur in connection with such investment. Each Benefit Plan Investor and its fiduciary acting on its behalf shall be solely responsible for determining whether any prohibited transaction exemptions apply and provide full relief to the acquisition and holding of Notes by the Benefit Plan Investor. Accordingly, each purchaser or transferee of any interest in the Notes will be deemed to have represented by its acquisition of any interest in the Notes that: either (A) no portion of the assets used to acquire and hold the Notes constitutes assets of any Benefit Plan Investor or Non-ERISA Plan Investor or (B) (1) the purchase, holding and ----- subsequent disposition of the Notes will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a violation under any provision of Similar Law, (2) none of the Transaction Parties has provided any investment recommendation or investment advice to the Benefit Plan Investor or Non-ERISA Plan Investor or any fiduciary or other person investing the assets of the Benefit Plan Investor or Non-ERISA Plan Investor (a “Fiduciary”) on which such investor or Fiduciary has relied in connection with the decision to acquire the Notes (or an interest therein), (3) none of the Transaction Parties is acting as a “fiduciary” within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA or Section 4975(e)(3) of the Code or any similar concept under Similar Law to the Benefit Plan Investor or Non-ERISA Plan Investor or the Fiduciary in connection with the Benefit Plan Investor’s or Non-ERISA Plan Investor’s acquisition of the Notes (or an interest therein) and (4) the Fiduciary is exercising its own independent judgment in evaluating the transaction. Each of the Transaction Parties has its own interests in the offering and sale of Notes and related transactions, which differ from the interests of any Benefit Plan Investor or Non-ERISA Plan Investor considering the acquisition or holding of Notes, and such financial interests are disclosed in this Offering Memorandum. Fiduciaries, or other persons considering acquiring the Notes on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Benefit Plan Investor or Non-ERISA Plan Investor, should consult with their own counsel and advisers regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, the Code and any Similar Laws to such investment.",N/A,as_expected,2024,138
107_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,25,PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION,25.1,,25.1.1,,"Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in a purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), dated as of the date hereof, by and among the Issuer, the Guarantors and the initial purchasers listed in Schedule I thereto (collectively, the “Initial Purchasers”), the Issuer has agreed to sell to each Initial Purchaser, and each Initial Purchaser has agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Issuer, together with all other Initial Purchasers, Notes in an aggregate principal amount of € million. The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by their counsel. The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes initially at the price indicated on the cover page hereof. After the initial offering of the Notes, the offering price and other selling terms of the Notes may from time to time be varied by the Initial Purchasers without notice. One or more of the Initial Purchasers may use affiliates or other appropriately licensed entities for sales of the Notes in jurisdictions in which such Initial Purchasers are not otherwise permitted. Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price set forth on the cover page hereof. The Purchase Agreement provides that the Issuer and each Guarantor will indemnify the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. We have agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, that during the period from the date hereof through and including the date that is 90 days after the date the Notes are issued, to not, and to cause our subsidiaries to not, without having received the prior written consent of the Joint Global Coordinators as provided for in the Purchase Agreement, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any securities that are substantially similar to the Notes. The Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act. The Initial Purchasers have agreed that they will only offer or sell the Notes outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. Terms used above have the meanings given to them by Regulation S under the Securities Act. In connection with sales outside the United States, the Initial Purchasers have agreed that they will not offer, sell or deliver the Notes to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (i) as part of the Initial Purchasers’ distribution at any time or (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the offering or the date the Notes are originally issued. The Initial Purchasers will send to each distributor, dealer or person to whom they sell such Notes during such 40-day period a confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the Notes within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. In addition, with respect to Notes initially sold pursuant to Regulation S, until 40 days after the later of the commencement of this offering or the date the Notes are originally issued, an offer or sale of such Notes within the United States by a dealer that is not participating in this offering may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act. No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by us, the Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us, the Guarantors or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the offering of the Notes, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and the resale of the Notes. ----- We have also agreed that we will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exclusion afforded by Regulation S under the Securities Act to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes. The Notes will constitute a new class of securities with no established trading market. Application will be made to the Authority for the Notes to be admitted to the Official List of TISE. However, there can be no assurance that the prices at which the Notes will sell in the market after this offering will not be lower than the initial offering price or that an active trading market for the Notes will develop and continue after this offering. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market-making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act and the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—There is no active public trading market for the Notes and therefore your ability to transfer them will be limited.” In connection with the issue of the Notes, the Stabilizing Manager or persons acting on its behalf may over-allot Notes or effect transactions with a view to supporting the market price of the Notes at a level that is higher than that which might otherwise prevail. However, we cannot assure you that the Stabilizing Manager or persons acting on its behalf will undertake stabilization action. Any stabilization action may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the offer of Notes is made and, if begun, may be ended at any time, but it must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the issue date of the Notes and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may in future perform, various financial advisory and commercial and investment banking services for the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries, including, for example, hedging, guarantee business, cash management, bilateral credit lines and other banking services, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses. In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Parent Guarantor and its affiliates. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may receive allocations of the Notes. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates are also agents, lenders and/or letter of credit issuers under the Revolving Credit Facility, and may be agents, lenders and/or letter of credit issuers under any credit facilities we may enter into. In addition, BofA Securities Europe S.A. is acting as principal and dealer manager for the Tender Offer. See “Summary—Concurrent Tender Offer.” Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates are lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with us routinely hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,138
