Canadian Offering Memorandum dated, 2020


-----

Attached hereto and forming part of this Canadian Offering Memorandum is an offering memorandum dated,
2020 (the “U.S. Offering Memorandum”) regarding the offer for sale of the notes being made in the United
States and elsewhere. Where the U.S. Offering Memorandum remains subject to amendment or completion, this
Canadian Offering Memorandum remains similarly subject to amendment or completion. Except as otherwise
provided herein, capitalized and other terms used within this Canadian Offering Memorandum without definition
have the meanings assigned to them in the U.S. Offering Memorandum, as applicable. The Offering in Canada is
being made solely by this Canadian Offering Memorandum, and any decision to purchase the notes should be
based solely on information contained in the final version of this document. No person has been authorized to
give any information or to make any representations concerning the Offering other than as contained herein.
Statements made within this Canadian Offering Memorandum are made as of the date of this Canadian Offering
Memorandum unless expressly stated otherwise. Neither the delivery of this Canadian Offering Memorandum at
any time, nor any other action with respect hereto, shall under any circumstances create an implication that the
information contained herein is correct as of any time subsequent to the date hereof.

The information in the U.S. Offering Memorandum has not been prepared with regard to matters that may be of
particular concern to Canadian investors. Accordingly, Canadian investors should consult with their own legal,
financial and tax advisers concerning the information in the U.S. Offering Memorandum and as to the suitability
of an investment in the notes in their particular circumstances.

**Unless otherwise noted, all amounts are expressed in U.S. Dollars. All references to “$” are to U.S. Dollars**
**and all references to “Canadian $” are to Canadian Dollars. The notes are denominated in U.S. Dollars**
**and not in Canadian Dollars. Accordingly, the Canadian Dollar value of the notes will fluctuate with**
**changes in the rate of exchange between the U.S. Dollar and the Canadian Dollar.**

**REPRESENTATIONS AND AGREEMENT BY PURCHASERS**

Each purchaser of notes in Canada (or such ultimate purchaser of notes for which the Initial Purchaser is acting
as agent) will be deemed to have made the applicable representations set out under the section entitled “Transfer
Restrictions” in the U.S. Offering Memorandum to the Company, the guarantors, the Initial Purchasers and each
dealer participating in the sale of the notes.

**RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE INITIAL PURCHASERS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES**
**AND THE COMPANY**

The Initial Purchasers are each, directly or indirectly, a wholly-owned or majority-owned subsidiary or affiliate
of financial institutions that are lenders, arrangers, bookrunners and/or agents (collectively, the “Connected
Banks”) to the Company and/or its subsidiaries under one or both of the Revolver and the 2018 Credit Facility. In
addition, the Initial Purchasers and/or certain of their affiliates are initial purchasers for the Other Offering.
Accordingly, the Company may be considered a “connected issuer” of each of Barclays, Citi, J.P. Morgan, BMO,
BofA, MS, RBC, CIBC, HSBC, MUFG, NBF, PNC, Scotia and Wells Fargo, as such term is defined in National
Instrument 33-105 – Underwriting Conflicts. As at December 31, 2019, there was approximately $750 million
outstanding under the Revolver and approximately $982.5 million outstanding under the 2018 Credit Facility.
The Revolver and the 2018 Credit Facility are secured by a first charge over substantially all of the Company’s
assets. The Company and/or its subsidiaries, as applicable, are currently in compliance with each of the Revolver
and the 2018 Credit Facility, and no breach of such credit facilities has been waived by any of the Connected
Banks or their related issuers party thereto, as applicable. The Company intends to use a portion of the net
proceeds from the Offerings to repay the outstanding $750 million drawn under the Revolver and to redeem in
full the outstanding $800 million aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes. As certain of the Initial
Purchasers or their affiliates act as lenders under the Revolver and/or may hold positions in the 2023 Notes,
certain of those Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may receive some of the proceeds from the Offerings.

The decision to distribute the notes and the 2030 Notes, including the terms of each of the Offerings, was made
through negotiations between the Company and the Initial Purchasers. The Connected Banks were not involved

2


-----

in these decisions or determinations, but have been advised of the Offerings and the terms thereof, including the
intended use of proceeds therefrom. The Initial Purchasers will receive their respective portion of the Initial
Purchasers’ commissions and other estimated expenses payable by the Company and Open Text Holdings Inc. to
the Initial Purchasers for the services rendered in connection with the Offerings. For more information on these
and other potential conflicts of interest, see “Plan of Distribution – Relationships” in the U.S. Offering
Memorandum.

The relationships between the Company and/or its subsidiaries and the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates,
including the Connected Banks, and other related matters, including the Company’s present financial condition,
are described in the U.S. Offering Memorandum. Canadian investors should refer to the information set forth in
the U.S. Offering Memorandum under the headings “Risk Factors – Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and the
Notes”, “Capitalization”, “Description of Other Indebtedness” and “Plan of Distribution” for additional
information prior to investing in the notes.

**LANGUAGE OF DOCUMENTS**

Each purchaser of notes in Canada hereby agrees that it is the purchaser’s express wish that all documents
evidencing or relating in any way to the sale of the notes be drafted in the English language only. Chaque
_acheteur au Canada des valeurs mobilières reconnaît que c’est sa volonté expresse que tous les documents_
_faisant foi ou se rapportant de quelque manière à la vente des valeurs mobilières soient rédigés uniquement en_
_anglais._

**CANADIAN RESALE RESTRICTIONS**

The Company is a “reporting issuer” in Canada within the meaning of applicable Canadian Securities Laws;
however, the distribution of the notes in the Provinces is being made on a “private placement” basis exempt from
the requirement that the Company prepare and file a prospectus with the securities commissions or similar
regulatory authorities in the Provinces. Accordingly, any resale of the notes must be made in accordance with, or
pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the prospectus requirements of applicable
provincial securities laws. These resale restrictions may in some circumstances apply to a resale of the securities
made outside of Canada. In addition, in order to comply with the dealer registration requirements of Canadian
Securities Laws, any resale of the notes must be made either by a person not required to register as a dealer under
applicable Canadian Securities Laws, or through an appropriately registered dealer or in accordance with an
exemption from the dealer registration requirements. Canadian purchasers are advised that the Company is not
required to file a prospectus or similar document with any securities regulatory authority in Canada qualifying
the resale of the notes to the public in Canada or any province or territory thereof. Purchasers of notes are
**advised to seek Canadian legal advice prior to any resale of the notes, both within and outside of Canada.**

##### % Senior Notes due 2028

We are offering $ million aggregate principal amount of our % Senior Notes due 2028 (the “notes”). We will pay interest
on the notes on and of each year, commencing on, 2020. The notes will mature on, 2028.
The aggregate principal amount of this offering, together with the Other Notes (as defined below) offering, is expected to be
approximately $1.6 billion.
We may redeem the notes, in whole or in part, at any time on or after, 2023, at the redemption prices set forth in this
offering memorandum, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. At any time prior to,
2023, we may redeem some or all of the notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed plus a
“make-whole” premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. We may also redeem up to 40% of the
aggregate principal amount of the notes at any time or from time to time, prior to, 2023, using the net proceeds from
certain equity offerings, at the redemption price set forth in this offering memorandum, together with accrued and unpaid interest,
if any, to the redemption date. See “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption.” Prior to, substantially concurrently with or shortly
after this offering of the notes, under a separate offering memorandum, Open Text Holdings, Inc., expects to have offered or to be
offering $ million aggregate principal amount of % Senior Notes due 2030 (the “Other Notes”). We will guarantee the
Other Notes. The completion of this offering and the completion of the Other Notes offering are not conditioned upon one another.
If we experience one of specified kinds of changes in control and if during the applicable trigger period (i) the notes are rated below
an investment grade rating by each of the rating agencies that rate the notes and (ii) the rating of the notes is lowered by any of the
rating agencies that rate the notes, we may be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal
amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase. See “Description of Notes—Change of
Control Triggering Event.”
The notes will be our senior unsecured obligations, will rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior
debt and will rank senior in right of payment to all of our future subordinated debt. The notes will initially be guaranteed on a senior
unsecured basis by our existing wholly-owned subsidiaries that borrow or guarantee the obligations under our Senior Credit
Facilities (as defined herein). Wholly-owned non-guarantor subsidiaries that in the future borrow or guarantee the obligations
under our existing Senior Credit Facilities will be added as guarantors in respect of the notes.
The notes and the guarantees will rank equally in right of payment with all of our and our guarantors’ existing and future senior
debt and will rank senior in right of payment to all of our and our guarantors’ future subordinated debt. The notes and the
guarantees will be effectively subordinated to all of our and our guarantors’ existing and future secured debt, including our
obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such secured debt. The notes and the
guarantees will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of our non-guarantor subsidiaries. Under certain
circumstances, the guarantors may be released from their note guarantees without the consent of the holders of the notes. See
“Description of Notes—Subsidiary Guarantees.”
There is currently no established trading market for the notes. We do not intend to register the notes for resale under the U.S.
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or to offer to exchange the notes for registered notes under the Securities
Act.
_Investing in the notes involves risks. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 18 and under “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of our Annual_
_Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the_
_applicable Canadian securities regulatory authorities on August 1, 2019 (the “2019 Annual Report”) and Item 1A of our Quarterly_
_Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC and the applicable Canadian securities regulatory_
_authorities on January 30, 2020 (the “Q2 Quarterly Report”) and incorporated by reference herein, for a discussion of certain risks_
_that you should consider in connection with an investment in the notes._
**Offering Price of the notes:** **% plus accrued interest, if any, from** **, 2020**
Delivery of the notes will be made on or about, 2020, which will be the tenth business day following the date of pricing of
the notes (such settlement cycle being herein referred to as “T+10”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the “Exchange Act”), trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the
parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the notes prior to their date of
delivery may be required, by virtue of the fact that the notes initially will settle T+10, to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the
time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of notes who wish to trade notes prior to their date of delivery
hereunder should consult their own advisor.
The notes and related guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act. The notes may not be offered
or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons, except to persons reasonably believed to be
qualified institutional buyers in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act (“Rule
144A”) and to certain persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act (“Regulation S”). You are
hereby notified that sellers of the notes may be relying on the exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act
provided by Rule 144A.

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS**

This offering memorandum is highly confidential and has been prepared by us solely for use in connection
with the proposed offering of the notes. We reserve the right to withdraw this offering of the notes at any time.
We and the initial purchasers also reserve the right to reject any offer to purchase, in whole or in part for any
reason, or to sell less than all of the notes offered hereby. This offering memorandum is personal to the offeree to
whom it has been delivered by the initial purchasers and does not constitute an offer to any other person or to the
public in general to subscribe for or otherwise acquire the notes. Distribution of this offering memorandum to
any person other than the offeree and those persons, if any, retained to advise such offeree with respect thereto is
unauthorized, and any disclosure of any of its contents, without our prior written consent, is prohibited. Each
offeree, by accepting delivery of this offering memorandum, agrees to the foregoing and to make no photocopies
or other duplication of this offering memorandum.

By accepting delivery of this offering memorandum, you acknowledge that: (1) you have been afforded an
opportunity to request from us, and to review, and have received, all additional information considered by you to
be necessary to verify the accuracy of, or to supplement, the information contained or incorporated by reference
in this offering memorandum; (2) you have not relied on the initial purchasers or any person affiliated with the
initial purchasers in connection with your investigation of the accuracy of such information or your investment

decision; (3) this offering memorandum relates to an offering that is exempt from the registration requirements of
the Securities Act and the prospectus requirement under applicable securities laws in each of the provinces in
Canada (the “Canadian Securities Laws”) and does not comply in important respects with the rules of the SEC
and the Canadian Securities Laws that would apply to an offering document relating to a public offering of
securities; and (4) no person has been authorized to give any information or to make any representation
concerning us or the guarantors or the notes (other than as contained or incorporated by reference in this offering
memorandum) and, if given or made, any such other information or representation should not be relied upon as
having been authorized by us or the initial purchasers.

Laws in certain jurisdictions may restrict the distribution of this offering memorandum and the offer and
sale of the notes and the guarantees. Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum or any of the
notes are delivered must inform themselves about, and observe, any such restrictions. Each prospective purchaser
of the notes must comply with all applicable laws and regulations in force in any jurisdiction in which it
purchases, offers or sells the notes or possesses or distributes this offering memorandum and must obtain any
consent, approval or permission required under any regulations in force in any jurisdiction to which it is subject
or in which it makes such purchases, offers or sales, and none of us, any of the guarantors or the initial
purchasers shall have any responsibility therefor.

Certain persons participating in this offering may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise
affect the price of the notes. Such transactions may include purchases of the notes to stabilize their market price,
purchases of the notes to cover all or some of an over-allotment or a short position in the notes maintained by the
initial purchasers and the imposition of penalty bids. Such activities, if commenced, may be discontinued at any
time. For a description of these activities, see “Plan of Distribution.”

**CONCURRENT OFFERING**

Prior to, substantially concurrently with or shortly after this offering of the notes, under a separate offering
memorandum, Open Text Holdings, Inc., a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of OpenText, expects to have
offered or to be offering $ million aggregate principal amount of % Senior Notes due 2030 (the
“Other Notes”). We will guarantee the Other Notes. The aggregate principal amount of this offering, together
with the Other Notes offering, is expected to be approximately $1.6 billion. The completion of this offering and
the completion of the Other Notes offering are not conditioned upon one another.

Information regarding the Other Notes in this offering memorandum is neither an offer to sell nor a
solicitation of an offer to buy the Other Notes, or any other securities.

References herein to “the offerings” refer to the offering of the notes and the Other Notes offering. The
Initial Purchasers will act as initial purchasers in the Other Notes offering.

**In making an investment decision, you must rely on your own examination of our business and the**
**terms of this offering, including the merits and risks involved. No federal, state, provincial or foreign**
**securities authorities have approved or disapproved of these securities or determined if this offering**
**memorandum is truthful or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.**

**We are offering the notes in the United States in reliance on exemptions from the registration**
**requirements of the Securities Act and in Canada pursuant to exemptions from the prospectus**
**requirement of applicable Canadian Securities Laws. These exemptions apply to offers and sales of**
**securities that do not involve a public offering. In making your purchase, you will be deemed to have made**
**certain acknowledgments, representations and agreements set forth in this offering memorandum under**
**the caption “Transfer Restrictions.” The notes are subject to restrictions on transferability and resale and**

ii


-----

**may not be transferred or resold except as permitted under the Securities Act and related regulations and**
**applicable state securities laws and applicable Canadian Securities Laws pursuant to registration or a**
**prospectus, as the case may be, or exemption therefrom. You should be aware that you may be required to**
**bear the financial risks of this investment for an indefinite period of time.**

**The initial purchasers make no representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or**
**completeness of the information set forth or incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum, and**
**nothing contained or incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum is, or shall be relied upon as,**
**a promise or representation, whether as to the past or the future. The initial purchasers do not assume any**
**responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the information included or incorporated by reference**
**in this offering memorandum.**

**The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be**
**offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (the**
**“EEA”) or the United Kingdom (the “UK”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is**
**one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as**
**amended or superseded, “MiFID II”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as**
**amended or superseded, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify**
**as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor**
**as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended or superseded, the “Prospectus Regulation”).**
**Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286 2014 (as amended or**
**superseded, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available**
**to retail investors in the EEA or in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the notes or**
**otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA or in the UK may be unlawful under the**
**PRIIPs Regulation.**

**In the United Kingdom, this offering memorandum is for distribution only to, and is directed only at,**
**and any offer of the notes subsequently made may only be directed at persons who (i) have professional**
**experience in matters relating to investments falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and**
**Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (as amended, the “Order”), (ii) are persons falling**
**within Article 43(2) of the Order, (iii) are persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (high net worth**
**companies, unincorporated associations, etc.) of the Order or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or**
**inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the Financial Services**
**and Markets Act 2000 (as amended, the “FSMA”)) in connection with the issue or sale of the notes may**
**otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons together being**
**“relevant persons”). Any person in the United Kingdom that is not a relevant person should not act or rely**
**on the information included in this offering memorandum or use it as a basis for taking any action. In the**
**United Kingdom, the notes are only available to, and any invitation, offer or agreement to subscribe,**
**purchase or otherwise acquire such notes will be engaged in only with relevant persons.**

**See “Risk Factors” herein and under “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of our 2019 Annual Report and Item**
**1A of our Q2 Quarterly Report for a description of factors relating to our business and an investment in**
**the notes. Neither we, the initial purchasers, nor any of our or their respective representatives are making**
**any representation to you regarding the legality of an investment by you under applicable legal investment**
**or similar laws. You should consult with your own advisors as to legal, tax, business, financial and related**
**aspects of a purchase of the notes.**

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act generally requires that an issuer
provide detailed financial information with regard to entities that provide guarantees of that issuer’s registered
debt securities and of entities that do not guarantee such debt securities. However, because the offer and sale of
the notes will not be registered with the SEC, our financial statements and the other financial data included and
incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum do not include such information.

Unless otherwise indicated, all financial information included or incorporated by reference in this offering
memorandum is derived from our historical audited consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2019 and 2018,
and audited consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for
the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, and our historical unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements as of December 31, 2019 and for the three-month and six-month periods ended September 30, 2019
and 2018 and December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which are incorporated by reference in this offering
memorandum. We believe that our financial statements and the other financial data included or incorporated by
reference in this offering memorandum have been prepared in a manner that complies, in all material respects,
with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”), other than the presentation of
certain measures that are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP (“Non-GAAP”). See “Non-GAAP Financial
Measures.”

Results for reporting periods commencing July 1, 2018 are presented under the new Topic 606 revenue
standard (Topic 606), while prior period results continue to be reported under the previous revenue standard. For
more details relating to our adoption of Topic 606, please see Note 1 “Basis of Presentation” and Note 3
“Revenues” to our Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2019 Annual Report, incorporated herein by
reference. Results for reporting periods commencing July 1, 2019 are presented under the new Accounting
Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02 “Leases (Topic 842)” (“Topic 842”), using the modified retrospective
transition approach. In accordance with this adoption method, results for reporting periods as of July 1, 2019 are
presented under the new standard, while prior period results continue to be reported under the previous standard,
please see Note 1 “Basis of Presentation” and Note 6 “Leases” to our unaudited Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements in our Q2 Quarterly Report, incorporated herein by reference.

Unless otherwise noted, all amounts are expressed in U.S. Dollars. All references to “$” are to U.S. Dollars
and all references to “Canadian $” are to Canadian Dollars.

**NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES**

In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company provides certain
Non-GAAP financial measures. These Non-GAAP financial measures have certain limitations in that they do not
have a standardized meaning and thus the Company’s definition may be different from similar Non-GAAP
financial measures used by other companies. Thus, it may be more difficult to compare the Company’s financial
performance to that of other companies. However, the Company’s management compensates for these limitations
by providing the relevant disclosure of the items excluded in the calculation of these Non-GAAP financial
measures both in its reconciliation to the U.S. GAAP measures and its consolidated financial statements, all of
which should be considered when evaluating the Company’s results. See “Summary—Summary Consolidated
Financial and Other Information” for a reconciliation of certain Non-GAAP measures to their most directly
comparable U.S. GAAP measures. The Company supplements the information provided in this offering
memorandum, which is presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, with the following Non-GAAP financial
measures (in addition to those already included, and reconciled, in its reports filed under the Exchange Act):
earnings (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”); Adjusted EBITDA (“Adjusted
EBITDA”), which further adjusts EBITDA to exclude share-based compensation, other income (expense), net
and special charges (recoveries) related to restructurings and acquisitions; and EBITDA Margin and Adjusted

1


-----

EBITDA Margin which are calculated as EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA, as applicable, divided by revenues as
determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The presentation of Non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to
be a substitute for financial measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, but rather should be evaluated in
conjunction with and as a supplement to such U.S. GAAP measures. OpenText strongly encourages investors to
review its financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure. Consolidated
EBITDA, as defined in “Description of Notes”, differs in certain respects from the calculation of EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA.

The Company believes that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA Margin and Adjusted EBITDA Margin
(and the other Non-GAAP financial measures included, and reconciled, in its reports filed under the Exchange
Act) improve comparability from period to period by excluding the distorting effect of certain non-operational
charges. The use of the term “non-operational charge” is defined for this purpose as an expense that does not
impact the ongoing operating decisions taken by the Company’s management. We believe that EBITDA,
Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA Margin and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are measures widely used by securities
analysts, investors and others to evaluate the financial performance of companies in our industry. Other
companies may calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA Margin and Adjusted EBITDA Margin
differently, and, therefore, our measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA Margin and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are not measures of financial
performance or liquidity under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net
income, cash flows from operating activities and other measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Items excluded from EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as noted above are significant and necessary components
of the operations of our business. Given the foregoing limitations, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA
Margin and Adjusted EBITDA Margin should only be used as supplemental measures of our operating
performance.

The Company believes the provision of the above mentioned supplemental Non-GAAP financial measures
included in this offering memorandum allows investors to evaluate the operational and financial performance of
the Company’s core business using measures that are commonly used in the industry in which the Company
operates and is therefore a useful indication for investors, security analysts and others to measure OpenText’s
performance or expected performance of future operations and facilitates period-to-period comparison of
operating performance (although prior performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance). As a
result, the Company considers it appropriate and reasonable to provide, in addition to U.S. GAAP measures,
supplementary Non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain items from the presentation of its financial
results.

**INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA**

We have obtained certain industry and market share data from third-party sources that we believe are
reliable. In many cases, however, we have made statements in this offering memorandum or in documents
incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum regarding our industry and our position in the industry
based on estimates made based on our experience in the industry and our own investigation of market conditions.
This information may prove to be inaccurate because of the method by which we obtained some of the data for
our estimates or because this information cannot always be verified with complete certainty due to the limits on
the availability and reliability of raw data, the voluntary nature of the data gathering process and other limitations
and uncertainties. As a result, you should be aware that the industry and market data included or incorporated by
reference in this offering memorandum, and estimates and beliefs based on that data, may not be reliable. We
cannot, and the initial purchasers cannot, guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any such information.

**AVAILABLE INFORMATION**

You should not assume that the information included or incorporated by reference in this offering
memorandum is accurate as of any date other than the date of this offering memorandum or the date of such

Drive, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada N2L 0A1, Telephone: (519) 888-7111, Attention: Corporate Secretary.

owner of notes or prospective purchaser of notes designated by such holder or beneficial owner, upon request of
such holder or beneficial holder, the information required to be delivered by Rule 144A(d)(4) under the
Securities Act to facilitate resales of the notes pursuant to Rule 144A.

**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

statements. These forward-looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and created under the Securities Act, and the Exchange Act and

When we use words such as “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,”
“may,” “could,” “would,” “will” and variations of these words or similar expressions, we do so to identify
forward-looking statements. In addition, any information or statements that refer to expectations, beliefs, plans,
projections, objectives, performance or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any
underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements, and are based on our current expectations, forecasts and
projections about the operating environment, economies and markets in which we operate. Forward-looking
statements in this offering memorandum or incorporated by reference herein include, but are not limited to,
(i) statements about our focus on growth in earnings and cash flows; (ii) creating value through investments in
broader Enterprise Information Management (“EIM”) or Information Management (“IM”) capabilities; (iii) our
future business plans and business planning process; (iv) statements relating to business trends; (v) statements

(xxii) statements about acquisitions and their expected impact; (xxiii) the expected timing, size, terms and
completion of the proposed offering of notes and the proposed concurrent offering of the Other Notes and the use
of proceeds therefrom; and (xxiv) other matters.

Forward-looking statements reflect our current estimates, beliefs and assumptions, which are based on
management’s perception of historic trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as
other factors it believes are appropriate in the circumstances. The forward-looking statements contained in this
offering memorandum and the documents incorporated by reference herein are based on certain assumptions
including the following: (i) countries continuing to implement and enforce existing and additional customs and
security regulations relating to the provision of electronic information for imports and exports; (ii) our continued
operation of a secure and reliable business network; (iii) the stability of general economic and market conditions,

currency exchange rates, and interest rates; (iv) equity and debt markets continuing to provide us with access to
capital; (v) our continued ability to identify and source attractive and executable business combination
opportunities, as well as our ability to continue to successfully integrate any such opportunities, including in
accordance with the expected timeframe and/or cost budget for such integration; and (vi) our continued
compliance with third party intellectual property rights. Management’s estimates, beliefs and assumptions are
inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive and other uncertainties and contingencies
regarding future events and, as such, are subject to change. We can give no assurance that such estimates, beliefs
and assumptions will prove to be correct. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks,
uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially
from the anticipated results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking
statements. The risks and uncertainties that may affect forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to:

acceptance; (v) a reduction in business with our existing customers; (vi) insufficient return on investment on our

and under Item 1A of the Q2 Quarterly Report incorporated by reference herein.

You should keep in mind that any forward-looking statement we make in this offering memorandum or the
documents incorporated by reference, speaks only as of the date on which we make it. New risks and
uncertainties arise from time to time, and it is impossible for us to predict these events or how they may affect us.
In any event, these and other important factors, including those set forth under the heading “Risk Factors”
elsewhere in this offering memorandum or the documents incorporated by reference, may cause actual results to
differ materially from those indicated by our forward-looking statements. We have no duty, and do not intend, to
update or revise the forward-looking statements we make in this offering memorandum or the documents

incorporated by reference, except as may be required by law. In light of these risks and uncertainties, you should
keep in mind that the future events or circumstances described in any forward-looking statement we make in this
offering memorandum or the documents incorporated by reference, might not occur.

**You should carefully consider the “Risk Factors” herein and under “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of our**
**2019 Annual Report and Item 1A of our Q2 Quarterly Report, as well as in our other reports filed with or**
**furnished to the SEC and Canadian securities regulators and incorporated by reference herein, before**
**making any investment decision with respect to our securities. If any of these trends, risks, assumptions or**
**uncertainties actually occurs or continues, our business, financial condition or results of operations could**
**be materially adversely affected, the trading prices of our securities could decline and you could lose all or**
**part of your investment. All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf**
**are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.**

**ENFORCEABILITY OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

We are a corporation organized under the laws of Canada. Many of the Company’s directors and officers,
and those of some of our subsidiaries, are residents of Canada or otherwise reside outside of the United States,
and all or a substantial portion of their assets, and a substantial portion of the assets of the Company and the
guarantors, are located outside of the United States. As a result, there may be jurisdictional issues should you
bring an action against directors or officers who are not residents of the United States, or against the Company or
the guarantors. We and the non-U.S. guarantors have appointed an agent for service of process in the United
States, but it may be difficult for holders of the notes who reside in the United States to effect service within the
United States upon those directors and officers who are not residents of the United States, or on the Company or
the non-U.S. guarantors. It may also be difficult for holders of the notes who reside in the United States to realize
in the United States upon judgments of courts of the United States predicated upon the civil liability of the
Company, the non-U.S. guarantors or the Company’s directors and officers under the United States federal
securities laws or “blue sky” laws of any state within the United States.

We have been advised by Blake, Cassels & Graydon LLP that there is substantial doubt whether an action
could be brought in Canada in the first instance on the basis of liability predicated upon United States federal
securities laws or “blue sky” laws of any state within the United States.

We have also been advised by Blake, Cassels & Graydon LLP that a judgment of a United States court may
be enforceable in Canada if: (a) there is a real and substantial connection between the events, persons and
circumstances and the forum in which the United States proceedings occur such that the United States court
properly assumed jurisdiction; (b) the United States judgment is final and conclusive and for a sum certain;
(c) the defendant was properly served with originating process from the United States court; and (d) the United
States law that led to the judgment is not contrary to Canadian public policy, as that term would be applied by a
court of competent jurisdiction in Canada (“Canadian Court”). We have been advised that in normal
circumstances, only civil judgments and not other rights arising from United States securities legislation (for
example, penal or similar awards made by a court in a regulatory prosecution or proceeding) are enforceable in
Canada.

The enforceability of a United States judgment in Canada will be subject to the requirements that: (i) an
action to enforce the United States judgment must be commenced in the Canadian Court within any applicable
limitation period; (ii) the Canadian Court has discretion to stay or decline to hear an action on the United States

**Our Company**

OpenText is an information management company, historically focused primarily on enabling the intelligent
and connected enterprise. With our recent acquisition of Carbonite, we believe we have entered into the next
phase of our Total Growth strategy where we have an opportunity to take advantage of Carbonite’s world-class
channel organization and partners, to bring our information management (“IM”) solutions to all size customers,
including small and medium businesses (“SMB”) and consumers. The comprehensive OpenText IM platform and
suite of software products and services provide secure and scalable solutions for global companies, SMBs,
governments and consumers around the world. With our software, organizations manage a valuable asset –
information: information that is made more valuable by connecting it to digital business processes, information
that is enriched with analytics, information that is protected and secure throughout its entire lifecycle,
information that captivates customers, and information that connects and fuels some of the world’s largest digital
supply chains in manufacturing, retail, and financial services. Our IM solutions are designed to enable
organizations and professional consumers to secure their information so that they can collaborate with
confidence, validate endpoints with all machines and the Internet of Things (“IoT”), stay ahead of the regulatory
technology curve, identify threats that cross their networks, leverage discovery with information forensics, and
gain insight and action through analytics, artificial intelligence (“AI”) and automation.

We offer software through traditional on-premises solutions, cloud solutions or a combination of both. We
believe our customers will operate in hybrid on-premises and cloud environments, and we are ready to support
the delivery method the customer prefers. In providing choice and flexibility, we strive to maximize the lifetime
value of the relationship with our customers.

Open Text Corporation was incorporated on June 26, 1991, under the laws of Canada, and we completed our
initial public offering on the NASDAQ in 1996 and we were subsequently listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange
in 1998. We are a multinational company and as of December 31, 2019, employed approximately 14,600 people
worldwide. Our principal office is at 275 Frank Tompa Drive, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada N2L 0A1, and our
telephone number at that location is (519) 888-7111. Our website is www.opentext.com. Our website is included
in this offering memorandum as an inactive textual reference only. Except for the documents specifically
incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum, information contained on our website is not
incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum and should not be considered to be a part of this
offering memorandum.

**Recent Developments**

On December 24, 2019, we acquired all of the equity interests in Carbonite, a leading provider of
cloud-based subscription backup, disaster recovery and endpoint security to SMB, professional consumers, and a
wide variety of partners. Total consideration for Carbonite was approximately $1.4 billion, comprised of

$1.3 billion paid in cash (inclusive of cash acquired) and approximately $0.1 billion currently held back and
unpaid in accordance with the purchase agreement. We believe the acquisition will increase our position in the
data protection and endpoint security space, further strengthen our cloud capabilities and open a new route to
connect with customers through Carbonite’s SMB and professional consumer channels and products. The results
of operations of Carbonite have been consolidated with those of OpenText beginning December 24, 2019. For
additional information on the Carbonite acquisition, please refer to the Q2 Quarterly Report.

**Optional Redemption** . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The notes will be redeemable at our option, in whole or in part, at any
time on or after, 2023, at the redemption prices set forth
under “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption” together with
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption.

At any time prior to, 2023, we may also redeem some or all
of the notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the
notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date,
plus a “make-whole” premium.

In addition, at any time and from time to time prior to,

redemption price of % of the principal amount of the notes,
together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of
redemption.

See “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption.”

**Additional Amounts . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Any payments made by the Company or any subsidiary guarantor
with respect to the notes will be made without withholding or
deduction of taxes, unless required by law. If the Company or any
subsidiary guarantor is required by law to withhold or deduct for or
on account of taxes imposed by a relevant taxing jurisdiction with
respect to a payment to the holders or beneficial owners of the notes,
the Company or such subsidiary guarantor will, subject to certain
exceptions, pay the additional amount necessary so that the net
amount received by holders or beneficial owners of the notes after the
withholding or deduction is not less than the amount they would have
received in the absence of the withholding or deduction. See
“Description of the Notes—Payment of Additional Amounts.”

**Redemption for Changes in**
**Withholding Taxes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** If the Company or any subsidiary guarantor is required to pay

not in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the aggregate
principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, to the date of redemption. See “Description of the Notes—
Redemption for Changes in Withholding Taxes.”

**Change of Control Offer . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Upon the occurrence of specified kinds of change of control, if during

agencies that rate the notes, we will be required to offer to repurchase
the notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the
notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase.
See “Description of Notes—Change of Control Triggering Event.”


11


-----

**Certain Covenants. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The notes will be issued under an indenture among us, each of the
guarantors, The Bank of New York Mellon, as U.S. trustee, and BNY
Trust Company of Canada, as Canadian trustee. The indenture
relating to the notes will, among other things, limit our and the
guarantors’ ability to:

                         - incur liens;

                        - enter into sale/leaseback transactions; and

                         - consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.

In addition, the indenture relating to the notes will limit our nonguarantor subsidiaries’ ability to create, assume, incur or guarantee
additional indebtedness without such non-guarantor subsidiaries
guaranteeing the notes on a pari passu basis.

These covenants are subject to a number of important limitations and
exceptions, which are described under “Description of Notes—
Certain Covenants.”

**Transfer Restrictions; No Registration**
**Rights . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The notes have not been and are not required to be registered or
qualified under the Securities Act or any state or other securities law,
including Canadian Securities Laws. The notes may not be offered or
sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not
subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and
applicable state securities laws and the prospectus requirement under
applicable Canadian Securities Laws. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**Book-Entry, Delivery and Form . . . . . .** The notes will be issued in book-entry form and will be represented
by permanent global certificates deposited with, or on behalf of, The
Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) and registered in the name of a
nominee of DTC. Beneficial interests in any of the notes will be
shown on, and transfers will be effected only through, records
maintained by DTC or its nominee, and any such interest may not be
exchanged for certificated securities, except in limited circumstances.
See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.”

**Form and Denomination . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The notes will be issued in registered form in minimum
denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess
thereof.

**Absence of Established Trading**
**Market for the Notes . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The notes are a new issue of securities and there is currently no
established trading market for the notes. We do not intend to apply for
a listing of the notes on any securities exchange or automated
quotation system. Accordingly, a liquid market for the notes may not
develop. The initial purchasers have advised us that they currently
intend to make a market in the notes. However, they are not obligated
to do so, and any such market-making with respect to the notes may
be discontinued by the initial purchasers in their discretion at any time
without notice. See “Plan of Distribution.”

We do not intend to register the notes for resale under the Securities
Act, or to offer to exchange the notes for registered notes under the
Securities Act, or to file a prospectus to qualify the notes for resale
under Canadian Securities Laws.

**Use of Proceeds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** We estimate that the net proceeds of this offering, after deducting the
initial purchasers’ commissions and other estimated expenses payable
by us in connection with this offering, will be approximately
$ million. We estimate that the total net proceeds from this
offering, together with the net proceeds from the Other Notes
offering, after deducting the initial purchasers’ commissions and other
estimated expenses payable by us and Open Text Holdings, Inc., will
be approximately $ billion.

We intend to use the substantial portion of the net proceeds from the
offerings to refinance $1.55 billion in outstanding debt, including to
redeem in full the outstanding $800 million aggregate principal
amount of the 2023 Notes, and to repay the full outstanding $750
million drawn under the Revolver, and we expect to use the balance
of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including potential
future acquisitions. See “Use of Proceeds.”

**Risk Factors . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** In evaluating an investment in the notes, prospective investors should
carefully consider, along with the other information included in this
offering memorandum, the specific factors set forth under the heading
“Risk Factors” in this offering memorandum, under Item 1A of our
2019 Annual Report, under Item 1A of our Q2 Quarterly Report, and

amount of this offering, together with the Other Notes offering, is
expected to be approximately $1.6 billion. The completion of this
offering and the completion of the Other Notes offering are not
conditioned upon one another.

**RISK FACTORS**

_Investing in the notes involves risk. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described_
_below, as well as under “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of the 2019 Annual Report and Item 1A of the Q2 Quarterly_
_Report, and in other documents that are incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum._

**Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and the Notes**

**_Our indebtedness could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations,_**
**_including the notes._**

We have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2019, after giving effect to this offering
of the notes and the use of proceeds therefrom (including redemption of the 2023 Notes and repayment of
outstanding amounts under the Revolver), we and the guarantors would have had $ billion of total
indebtedness, $982.5 million of which would have consisted of secured indebtedness under the 2018 Credit
Facility, $850 million aggregate principal amount of which would have consisted of our outstanding 2026 Notes,
and $143.8 million aggregate principal amount of which would have consisted of the 2022 Notes, in addition to
the availability of $750 million under the Revolver (exclusive of any letters of credit outstanding, which reduce
the amount available). Amounts repaid under the Revolver with the net proceeds of the offerings may in the
future be reborrowed. Our substantial amount of indebtedness could have important consequences. For example
it could:

   - make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness;

   - increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

   - expose us to fluctuations in the interest rate environment because the interest rates under the 2018 Credit
Facility and the Revolver are variable;

   - require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our
indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital
expenditures, acquisitions, dividends and other general corporate purposes;

   - limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and
other general purposes;

   - limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we
operate, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less
debt; and

   - restrict us from pursuing business opportunities.

Further information on our indebtedness appears in “Capitalization” and “Description of Other
Indebtedness.”

**_Acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and other business initiatives may require substantial investment of_**
**_funds or financings by issuance of additional debt or equity securities._**

The growth of our Company through the successful acquisition and integration of complementary
businesses is a critical component of our corporate strategy. Thus, we continue to seek opportunities to acquire or
invest in businesses, products and technologies that expand, complement or otherwise relate to our current or
future business. We may also consider, from time to time, opportunities to engage in joint ventures or other
business collaborations with third parties to address particular market segments. Any such acquisition,
investment, joint venture or other business collaboration may require substantial investment of funds or
financings by issuance of additional debt or equity securities. Such activities could result in one-time charges and
expenses and have the potential to either dilute the interests of existing shareholders or result in the issuance or
assumption of additional debt. If we are unable to access capital markets on acceptable terms or at all, we may
not be able to consummate acquisitions, or may have to do so on the basis of a less than optimal capital structure.

18


-----

**_Our indebtedness may restrict our current and future operations, which could adversely affect our ability to_**
**_respond to changes in our business and manage our operations._**

The terms of the Senior Credit Facilities, the indenture governing the 2023 Notes (the “2023 Notes
Indenture”), the indenture governing the 2026 Notes (the “2026 Notes Indenture”), the indenture governing the
Other Notes, and the indenture governing the notes include a number of restrictive covenants that impose
significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our restricted subsidiaries, including restrictions on our
and our restricted subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things:

   - incur liens;

   - enter into sale/leaseback transactions; and

   - consolidate, merge or amalgamate.

   - The terms of the Senior Credit Facilities also include certain additional restrictive covenants that impose
significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our restricted subsidiaries, including
restrictions on our and our restricted subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things:

   - make investments, loans and acquisitions;

   - dispose of assets;

   - incur additional debt;

   - make certain restricted payments, including a limit on dividends on equity securities or payments to
redeem, repurchase or retire equity securities or other indebtedness;

   - engage in transactions with affiliates;

   - materially alter the business we conduct; and

   - enter into certain restrictive agreements.

In addition, the Senior Credit Facilities require us to comply with financial covenants. The 2018 Credit
Facility and Revolver require that we maintain a “consolidated net leverage” ratio of no more than 4:1 at the end
of each financial quarter.

Our ability to comply with these agreements may be affected by events beyond our control, including
prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. These covenants could have an adverse effect on our
business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition or other opportunities. The
breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the Senior Credit Facilities, the
2023 Notes Indenture, the 2026 Notes Indenture, the indenture governing the Other Notes or the indenture
governing the notes.

**_Our failure to comply with the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness, including as a result of_**
**_events beyond our control, could result in an event of default that could materially and adversely affect our_**
**_business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity._**

If there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness,
including the Senior Credit Facilities, the 2023 Notes Indenture, the 2026 Notes Indenture, the indenture
governing the Other Notes and the indenture governing the notes, we may not be able to incur additional
indebtedness under the Revolver and the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with
respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately. We cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would
be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of
default, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate as a going concern.
Further, if we are unable to repay, refinance or restructure our secured indebtedness, the holders of such
indebtedness could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness. In addition, any event of default or
declaration of acceleration under one debt instrument also could result in an event of default under one or more
of our other debt instruments.

19


-----

**_We, including our subsidiaries, have the ability to incur substantially more indebtedness, including senior_**
**_secured indebtedness, which could further increase the risks associated with our leverage._**

Subject to the restrictions in the Senior Credit Facilities, the 2023 Notes Indenture, the 2026 Notes
Indenture, the indenture governing the Other Notes, and the indenture governing the notes, we, including our
subsidiaries, have the ability to incur significant additional indebtedness. As of December 31, 2019, after giving
effect to the offering of the notes and the Other Notes offering and the use of proceeds therefrom (including the
redemption of the 2023 Notes and repayment of outstanding amounts under the Revolver):

   - we and the guarantors would have had $ billion of total indebtedness, $982.5 million of which
would have consisted of secured indebtedness under the 2018 Credit Facility, $850 million aggregate
principal amount of which would have consisted of our outstanding 2026 Notes, $143.8 million
aggregate principal amount of which would have consisted of the outstanding 2022 Notes,
$ million aggregate principal amount of which would have consisted of our Other Notes, and
$ million aggregate principal amount of which would have consisted of the notes offered hereby;

   - we would have had $750 million available for borrowing under the Revolver (exclusive of any letters of
credit outstanding, which reduce the amount available), which, if borrowed, would be senior secured
indebtedness (amounts repaid under the Revolver with the net proceeds of the offerings may in the
future be reborrowed); and

   - our non-guarantor subsidiaries would not have had any long-term debt.

The Senior Credit Facilities are secured by a first charge over substantially all of our assets. In addition,
subject to the restrictions contained in the Senior Credit Facilities, the 2023 Notes Indenture, the 2026 Notes
Indenture, the indenture governing the Other Notes, and the indenture governing the notes, we may incur
additional secured debt, the amount of which may be substantial. The Senior Credit Facilities are, and any other
future secured indebtedness would be, effectively senior to the notes and the guarantees to the extent of the
collateral securing such indebtedness.

The 2023 Notes Indenture and the 2026 Notes Indenture do not, and the indenture governing the Other
Notes and the indenture governing the notes will not, restrict our ability to incur unsecured indebtedness, except,
subject to certain exceptions, unsecured debt of our non-guarantor subsidiaries. Although the terms of the Senior
Credit Facilities include restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to
a number of important exceptions, and indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be
substantial. If we incur significant additional indebtedness, the related risks that we face could increase.

Information on our indebtedness appears in “Capitalization” and “Description of Other Indebtedness.”

**_We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take_**
**_other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful._**

Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control, and any failure to meet our debt
service obligations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to make
payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund working capital needs and planned capital
expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to
general economic, financial, competitive, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our
control.

If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or if future borrowings are not
available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs,
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before the maturity thereof, sell assets, reduce
or delay capital investments or seek to raise additional capital, any of which could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may not be able to effect any of

20


-----

these actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The terms of existing or future debt
instruments may limit or prevent us from taking any of these actions. Our ability to restructure or refinance our
indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any
refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous
covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. In addition, any failure to make scheduled
payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness would likely result in a reduction of our credit
rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all.
Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, or to refinance or restructure
our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would have an adverse effect, which could be
material, on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, our Senior Credit Facilities:

   - require us to grant a first charge on substantially all of our assets; and

   - require us to maintain a certain defined “consolidated net leverage” ratio below a specified level at the
end of each financial quarter, thereby reducing our financial flexibility.

These provisions:

   - could have a material adverse effect on our ability to withstand competitive pressures or adverse
economic conditions;

   - could adversely affect our ability to make material acquisitions, obtain future financing or take
advantage of business opportunities that may arise;

   - could increase our vulnerability to a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business; and

   - could adversely affect our ability to continue to declare and pay cash dividends.

**_The notes will not be secured by any of our assets and therefore will be effectively subordinated to all of our_**
**_existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness._**

The notes will be general unsecured obligations and will be effectively subordinated to all of our existing
and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the collateral securing such indebtedness. Our obligations under
the notes and our guarantors’ obligations under their guarantees of the notes are unsecured, but our obligations
under the Senior Credit Facilities are secured by a first charge over substantially all of our assets. The guarantees
will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future secured indebtedness we may have up to the value of
the collateral securing that indebtedness and structurally subordinated to any existing and future liabilities and
other indebtedness of our non-guarantor subsidiaries with respect to the assets of such subsidiaries. These
liabilities may include debt securities, credit facilities, trade payables, guarantees, lease obligations, letter of
credit obligations and other
indebtedness.

As of December 31, 2019, after giving effect to the offering of the notes and the Other Notes offering and
the use of proceeds therefrom (including the redemption of the 2023 Notes and the repayment of outstanding
amounts under the Revolver), we and the guarantors would have had $ billion of total indebtedness,
$982.5 million of which would have consisted of secured indebtedness under the 2018 Credit Facility,
$850 million aggregate principal amount of which would have consisted of our outstanding 2026 Notes,
$143.8 million aggregate principal amount of which would have consisted of the outstanding 2022 Notes,
$ million aggregate principal amount of which would have consisted of the Other Notes, and $ million
aggregate principal amount of which would have consisted of the notes offered hereby, and (2) we would have
had $750 million available for borrowing under the Revolver (exclusive of any letters of credit outstanding,
which reduce the amount available), which, if borrowed, would be senior secured indebtedness.

In the event that we are declared bankrupt, become insolvent or are liquidated or reorganized or if we
default under the Credit Facilities, the lenders could enforce or foreclose on the pledged assets to the exclusion of

21


-----

holders of the notes, even if an event of default exists under the indenture governing the notes at such time.
Furthermore, if the lenders enforce or foreclose upon and sell the pledged equity interests in any guarantor of the
notes offered hereby, then that guarantor will be released from its guarantee of the notes automatically and
immediately upon such sale. In any such event, because the notes offered hereby will not be secured by any of
our assets or the equity interests in the guarantors, it is possible that there would be no assets remaining from
which your claims could be satisfied or, if any assets remained, they might be insufficient to satisfy your claims
in full.

**_The notes will be structurally subordinated to all indebtedness of our existing subsidiaries that are not_**
**_guarantors of the notes and our future subsidiaries that do not become guarantors of the notes; each of the_**
**_guarantors may be released upon the occurrence of certain conditions._**

The notes will be guaranteed by each of our existing and future subsidiaries that borrow or guarantee the
obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities other than as specified in this offering memorandum. The notes
may not be guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries that guarantee certain other debt we may incur. As of
December 31, 2019, our non-guarantor subsidiaries would not have had any debt. Claims of holders of the notes
will be structurally subordinated to the claims of creditors of our non-guarantor subsidiaries, including trade
creditors. Our non-guarantor subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation,
contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due pursuant to the notes or the guarantees or to make any funds
available therefor, whether by dividends, loans, distributions or other payments. All obligations of our
non-guarantor subsidiaries will have to be satisfied before any of the assets of such subsidiaries would be
available for distribution, upon a liquidation or otherwise, to us or a guarantor of the notes.

In addition, the 2023 Notes Indenture and the 2026 Notes Indenture permit, and the indenture governing the
Other Notes and the indenture governing the notes will permit, subject to some limitations, these non-guarantor
subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness and will not include any limitation on the amount of other liabilities,
such as trade payables, that may be incurred by these subsidiaries.

For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 and the six months ended December 31, 2019, the non-guarantor
subsidiaries of OpenText accounted for approximately $1,337 million and $728.2 million (after giving effect to
intercompany eliminations), or 46.6% and 49.6%, respectively, of OpenText’s consolidated revenue and
approximately $157.6 million and $75.8 million, or 14.3% and 13.3%, respectively, of OpenText’s consolidated
Adjusted EBITDA. As of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2019, the non-guarantor subsidiaries of OpenText
accounted for approximately $1,723 million and $3,254 million, or 21.7% and 34.3%, respectively, of
OpenText’s consolidated total assets (excluding intercompany assets), and did not have any long-term debt.

Each of the guarantors will be released from their note guarantees upon the occurrence of certain events,
including the release of such guarantor from its obligations as a guarantor under the Senior Credit Facilities. If
any note guarantee is released, no holder of the notes will have a claim as a creditor against that subsidiary under
that guarantee.

**_The indenture governing the notes and the indenture governing the Other Notes will contain negative_**
**_covenants that may have a limited effect._**

The indenture governing the notes and the indenture governing the Other Notes will contain only limited
covenants that will restrict our ability and ability of our guarantor subsidiaries to create certain liens, enter into
certain sale and lease-back transactions and consolidate or merge with or into, or sell our consolidated assets
substantially as an entirety to, another person and the ability of our non-guarantor subsidiaries to incur additional
indebtedness. These limited covenants contain exceptions that will allow us and our guarantor subsidiaries to
incur liens with respect to material assets and additional subsidiary debt. See “Description of Notes—Certain
Covenants.” In light of these exceptions, holders of the notes may be structurally or contractually subordinated to
a substantial amount of new debt. Additionally, the covenants in the indenture governing the notes will not limit

22


-----

the ability of us and our guarantor subsidiaries to, among other things, incur unsecured debt, pay dividends,
repurchase stock, make investments, dispose of assets not constituting our consolidated assets substantially as an
entirety or enter into transactions with our affiliates.

**_Repayment of our indebtedness, including the notes, is dependent on cash flow generated by our subsidiaries._**

Our subsidiaries own a significant portion of our assets and conduct a significant portion of our operations.
Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness, including the notes, is dependent, to a significant extent, on the
generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt
repayment or otherwise. Unless they are guarantors of the notes, our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to
pay amounts due on the notes or to make funds available for that purpose. Certain of our subsidiaries may not be
able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our
indebtedness, including the notes. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to
us in the future will depend on their earnings, tax considerations and covenants contained in any financing or
other agreements, among other things. Such payments may be limited as a result of claims against our
subsidiaries by their creditors, including suppliers, vendors, lessors and employees. Each subsidiary is a distinct
legal entity and, under certain circumstances, we may be limited in our ability to obtain cash from our
subsidiaries. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make
required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, including the notes.

**_An increase in interest rates would increase the cost of servicing our debt and could reduce our profitability._**

Borrowings under the Senior Credit Facilities bear interest at variable rates. Interest rate changes could
affect the amount of our interest payments, and accordingly, our future earnings and cash flows, assuming other
factors are held constant. As a result, an increase in interest rates, whether because of an increase in market
interest rates or an increase in our own cost of borrowing, would increase the cost of servicing our debt and could
materially reduce our profitability. For example, as of December 31, 2019, an increase of one percent in the
interest rates for the 2018 Credit Facility would increase annual interest expense by approximately $9.8 million,
assuming that the loan balance as of December 31, 2019 is outstanding for the entire period and as of
December 31, 2019, an increase of one percent in the interest rate for the Revolver would increase annual interest
expense by approximately $7.5 million, assuming that the full balance as of December 31, 2019 is outstanding
for the entire period.

**_The interest rates of certain of our indebtedness that extend beyond 2021 might be subject to change based on_**
**_recent regulatory changes._**

LIBOR, the London Interbank Offered Rate, is the basic rate of interest used in lending transactions
between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on
loans globally. Our Term Loan uses LIBOR as a reference rate such that the interest due to banks pursuant to the
Term Loan extended to us is calculated using LIBOR. Amounts drawn under the Revolver also currently bear
interest at LIBOR plus a margin.

On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced
that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear if at that time LIBOR will cease to exist or if
new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. The future of
LIBOR at this time is uncertain: it is not possible to predict the effect of any such changes, any establishment of
alternative reference rates or any other reforms to LIBOR that may be enacted in the United Kingdom or
elsewhere. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate certain terms of our 2018 Credit Facility and
Revolver, which may have an adverse effect on our ability to receive attractive returns. If we are unable to do so,
amounts drawn under the Revolver may bear interest at a higher rate, which would increase the cost of our
borrowings and, in turn, affect our results of operation.

**_Your ability to enforce civil liabilities in Canada under U.S. securities laws may be limited._**

We are a corporation organized under the laws of Canada. Many of the Company’s directors and officers,
and those of some of our subsidiaries, are residents of Canada or otherwise reside outside of the United States,
and all or a substantial portion of their assets, and a substantial portion of the assets of the Company and the
guarantors, are located outside of the United States. As a result, there may be jurisdictional issues should you
bring an action against directors or officers who are not residents of the United States, or against the Company or
the guarantors. We and the non-U.S. guarantors have appointed an agent for service of process in the United
States, but it may be difficult for holders of the notes who reside in the United States to effect service within the
United States upon those directors and officers who are not residents of the United States, or on the Company or
the non-U.S. guarantors. It may also be difficult for holders of the notes who reside in the United States to realize
in the United States upon judgments of courts of the United States predicated upon the civil liability of the
Company, the non-U.S. guarantors or the Company’s directors and officers under the United States federal
securities laws, or “blue sky” laws of any state within the United States.

We have been advised by Blake, Cassels & Graydon LLP that there is substantial doubt whether an action
could be brought in Canada in the first instance on the basis of liability predicated upon United States federal
securities laws, or “blue sky” laws of any state within the United States.

We have also been advised by Blake, Cassels & Graydon LLP that a judgment of a United States court may
be enforceable in Canada if: (a) there is a real and substantial connection between the events, persons and
circumstances and the forum in which the United States proceedings occur such that the United States court
properly assumed jurisdiction; (b) the United States judgment is final and conclusive and for a sum certain;
(c) the defendant was properly served with originating process from the United States court; and (d) the United
States law that led to the judgment is not contrary to Canadian public policy, as that term would be applied by a
Canadian court. We have been advised that in normal circumstances, only civil judgments and not other rights
arising from United States securities legislation (for example, penal or similar awards made by a court in a
regulatory prosecution or proceeding) are enforceable in Canada.

The enforceability of a United States judgment in Canada will be subject to the requirements that: (i) an
action to enforce the United States judgment must be commenced in the Canadian Court within any applicable
limitation period; (ii) the Canadian Court has discretion to stay or decline to hear an action on the United States
judgment if the United States judgment is under appeal or there is another subsisting judgment in any jurisdiction
relating to the same cause of action; (iii) the Canadian Court will render judgment only in Canadian dollars; and
(iv) an action in the Canadian Court on the United States judgment may be affected by bankruptcy, insolvency or
other laws of general application limiting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally.

The enforceability of a United States judgment in Canada will be subject to the following defenses: (i) the
United States judgment was obtained by fraud or in a manner contrary to the principles of natural justice; (ii) the
United States judgment is for a claim which under the law of the applicable Canadian province would be
characterized as based on a foreign revenue, expropriatory, penal or other public law; (iii) the United States
judgment is contrary to the public policy of the applicable Canadian province or to an order made by the
Attorney General of Canada under the Foreign Extraterritorial Measures Act (Canada) or by the Competition
Tribunal under the Competition Act (Canada) in respect of certain judgments referred to in these statutes; and
(iv) the United States judgment has been satisfied or is void or voidable under United States law.

**_Under certain circumstances a court could cancel or void the notes and/or the related guarantees. If that_**
**_occurs, you may not receive any payments on the notes and/or the guarantees._**

Canadian federal and provincial laws on preferences, fraudulent conveyances, transfers at undervalue or
other challengeable or voidable transactions and U.S. federal and state fraudulent transfer and conveyance
statutes may apply to the issuance of the notes and the incurrence of the guarantees of the notes. Other
jurisdictions in which the guarantors are organized could have similar laws that could cause a guarantee to be
challenged, voided or set aside.

24


-----

Although the relevant laws may differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, generally under such laws, including
under U.S. federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of U.S. state fraudulent transfer or conveyance
laws, which may vary from state to state, the notes or the guarantees could be voided as a fraudulent transfer or
conveyance if the issuer or any of the guarantors, as applicable: (1) issued the notes or incurred the guarantees
with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or (2) received less than reasonably equivalent
value or fair consideration in return for issuing the notes or a guarantee, and, in the case of (2) only, for many
jurisdictions, at least one of the following is also true at the time thereof:

   - the issuer or any of the guarantors, as applicable, were insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the
issuance of the notes or the incurrence of the guarantees;

   - the issuance of the notes or the incurrence of the guarantees left the issuer or any of the guarantors with
an unreasonably small amount of capital to carry on our or such guarantor’s business; or

   - the issuer or any of the guarantors intended to, or believed that we or such guarantor would, incur debts
beyond our or such guarantor’s ability to pay as they mature.

Under Canadian federal bankruptcy and insolvency laws and comparable provincial laws on preferences,
fraudulent conveyances, transfers at undervalue or other challengeable or voidable transactions, the payment of
money, disposition of property, incurrence of an obligation, or provision of services to a creditor or other person
can be challenged as a preference, fraudulent conveyance, transfer at undervalue or other challengeable or
voidable transaction. The tests to be applied under these Canadian laws vary, but as a general matter, these
challenges may arise in circumstances where (1) an entity is found to be insolvent at the time it issued a note or
provided a guarantee, (2) an entity was rendered insolvent by issuing a note or providing a guarantee, (3) a note
was issued, or a guarantee was provided, within a specified period of time prior to the commencement of
proceedings under Canadian bankruptcy, insolvency and other restructuring legislation, which period of time
varies depending on whether the issuance or guarantee is made to a party dealing at arm’s length or not, and the
consideration received by the insolvent note issuer or guarantor was conspicuously less than the fair market value
of the consideration given by the note issuer or guarantor, (4) an insolvent note issuer or guarantor intended to
defraud, defeat or delay a creditor or such action was taken with a view to giving such a creditor a preference,
(5) holders of notes, or beneficiaries under guarantees, were not dealing at arm’s length with an insolvent issuer
or guarantor and the obligation incurred had the effect of giving such holders of notes, or beneficiaries under
guarantees, a preference, or (6) a note issuer or a guarantor is found to have acted in a manner that was
oppressive, unfairly prejudicial to, or unfairly disregarded the interests of, any shareholder, creditor, director,
officer or other interested party. Although varying by jurisdiction generally, if a court were to find that the
issuance of the notes or the incurrence of the guarantees was a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, the court could
void the payment obligations under the notes or such guarantee or subordinate the notes or such guarantee to
presently existing and future indebtedness of ours or of the related guarantor, or require the holders of the notes
to repay any amounts received with respect to the notes or such guarantee. In the event of a finding that a
fraudulent transfer or conveyance occurred, you may not receive any repayment on the notes. Further, the
voidance of the notes or the guarantees could result in an event of default with respect to our and our
subsidiaries’ other debt that could result in acceleration of such debt.

As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or
obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is secured or satisfied. Any of the guarantees could
be subject to a claim that the guarantee was incurred for our direct benefit and only indirectly for the benefit of
the guarantor, and therefore that the guarantee obligations of such guarantor were incurred for less than fair
consideration or reasonably equivalent value. We cannot be certain of the standards that a court would apply to
determine where a subsidiary guarantor received reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration directly or
indirectly from the issuance of the notes and the incurrence of the guarantees.

In those cases where our solvency or the solvency of a guarantor is a relevant factor, the measures of
insolvency will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a preference,

25


-----

fraudulent conveyance, transfer at undervalue or other challengeable or voidable transaction has occurred.
Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness:

   - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all its
assets;

   - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its
probable liability on its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they become
absolute and mature; or

   - it could not pay its debts as they become due.

In general, a Canadian court would deem an entity insolvent if:

   - it is for any reason unable to meets its obligations as they generally become due;

   - it has ceased paying its current obligations in the ordinary course of business as they generally become
due; or

   - the aggregate of its property is not, at a fair valuation, sufficient or, if disposed of at a fairly conducted
sale under legal process, would not be sufficient to enable payment of all of its obligations, due and
accruing due.

We cannot be sure as to how these standards of insolvency (or similar standards under U.S. state and federal
law) would be applied by any particular court, or regardless of the standard that the court uses, that the issuance
of the notes or the guarantees would not be subject to a claim that would be voided as a preference, fraudulent
conveyance, transfer at undervalue or other challengeable or voidable transaction. If a court were to find that the
issuance of the notes or the incurrence of a guarantee was a preference, fraudulent conveyance, transfer at
undervalue or other challengeable or voidable transaction, a court could void the payment obligations and other
obligations under the notes or such guarantee or require the holders of the notes to repay any amounts received
with respect to the notes or such guarantee. In the event of a finding that a preference, fraudulent conveyance,
transfer at undervalue or other challengeable or voidable transaction occurred, you may not receive any
repayment on the notes or a guarantee. If a court voided the notes or held them unenforceable for any reason,
holders of the notes would cease to have a claim against the guarantors based upon the guarantees of the notes.
Further, the avoidance of the notes or guarantees could result in an event of default with respect to our and our
subsidiaries’ other debt that could result in acceleration of that debt.

Also, a Canadian or U.S. court may subordinate the claims in respect of the notes or guarantees to other
claims against the issuer and/or guarantors if the court determines that (1) the holder of notes or beneficiary of
the guarantee engaged in some form of inequitable conduct, (2) the inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our
other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holders of the notes or beneficiaries of the guarantees,
and (3) such subordination is not inconsistent with applicable laws. A Canadian or U.S. court may also impose
substantive consolidation, or variants thereof, on insolvent debtor company estates, and this may impair your
ability to collect payment in full under the notes and the guarantees. Similar remedies may be granted under U.S.
(or other applicable) law.

The indenture governing the notes will include a “savings clause” intended to limit each guarantor’s liability
under its guarantee to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the guarantee to be a fraudulent
transfer under applicable law with respect to each guarantor. There can be no assurance that this provision will be
upheld as intended. In one case, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida invalidated a
similar provision, held the guarantees to be fraudulent transfers and voided them in their entirety. The United
States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the liability findings of the Bankruptcy Court without
ruling directly on the enforceability of savings clauses. If the bankruptcy court decision were followed by other
courts, the savings clause may not be effective to protect the guarantees from being voided under fraudulent
transfer law. While the decision of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida is not binding
on Canadian courts, it is possible that a Canadian court would make a finding consistent with the result.

26


-----

**_Each guarantor’s liability under its guarantee may be significantly limited, voided or released under certain_**
**_circumstances such that you may not receive any payments from some or all of the guarantors._**

The notes will have the benefit of the guarantees of our guarantors. However, the indenture governing the
notes will include a “savings clause” intended to limit each guarantor’s liability under its guarantee to the
maximum amount that it could incur without causing the guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer under applicable
law with respect to each guarantor. As a result, a guarantor’s liability under its guarantee could be significantly
limited, voided or reduced to zero. In addition, under the circumstances discussed more fully above, a court
under applicable fraudulent conveyance and transfer statute could void the obligations under a guarantee or
further subordinate it to all other obligations of the guarantor. In addition, you will lose the benefit of a particular
guarantee if it is released under certain circumstances described under “Description of Notes—Subsidiary
Guarantees.”

Although the relevant laws may differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, a guarantee issued by a company
that is not conducive to the realization of the corporate objectives of the company, prejudices the interest of
present and future creditors of the company, constitutes a misuse of corporate assets or is not in the company’s
corporate interests, or in circumstances where the burden of which exceeds the benefit to the company, may not
be valid and enforceable. As the concept of corporate interest may not be defined by law in certain jurisdictions,
it may require a subjective judgment and we cannot be certain about the standard a court would use to determine
and assess the corporate benefit of the guarantor and, subsequently, in case the guarantee is deemed to be in
breach of such corporate benefit, (1) to determine and assess any amount up to which such guarantee would be
limited or (2) whether such guarantee would be deemed void ab initio. In intra-group transactions, the mere
existence of a group interest may not compensate for a lack of corporate interest for one or more of the
companies of the group taken individually. Under the applicable laws of the relevant jurisdiction, significant
limitations may be placed on guarantees of current and future foreign guarantors and such guarantees may be
subject to a maximum amount corresponding to a portion of such guarantor’s assets, funds or shareholders’
equity. It is possible that a guarantor, a creditor of a guarantor or the insolvency administrator in the case of an
insolvency of a guarantor, or another party in interest with standing to bring the challenge, may contest the
validity and enforceability of the guarantee and that the applicable court may determine that the guarantee should
be limited or voided. In the event that any guarantees are deemed invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or
to the extent that agreed limitations on the guarantee obligation apply, the notes would be effectively
subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable guarantor, including trade payables of such guarantor.

**_Enforcing your rights as a holder of the notes or under the guarantees across multiple jurisdictions may be_**
**_difficult._**

We are incorporated under the laws of Canada. The guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Canada
and the United States. In the future, subsidiaries in other jurisdictions may become guarantors. In the event of
bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions and in the
jurisdiction of incorporation of a future guarantor of the notes. Your rights under the notes and the guarantees
will thus be subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions, and you may not be able to effectively enforce your
rights in multiple bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar proceedings. Multi-jurisdictional proceedings are
typically complex and costly for creditors and often result in substantial uncertainty and substantial delays in the
enforcement of creditors’ rights.

In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative, and other laws of the respective guarantors’
jurisdictions of incorporation may be materially different from, or in conflict with, one another and those of each
of Canada and the United States, including creditors’ rights and remedies, priority of creditors, priority claims,
the ability to obtain post-petition or post-filing interest (and make-whole premiums and other premiums) and the
duration of the insolvency proceeding. The application of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could
trigger disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply and could have a material adverse effect or result in
substantial uncertainty or substantial delays on your ability to enforce your rights and to collect payment in full
under the notes and the guarantees.

**_There is no established trading market for the notes and you may not be able to sell the notes readily or at or_**
**_above the price that you paid or at all._**

The notes are a new issue of securities and there is no established trading market for them. We do not intend
to apply for the notes to be listed on any securities exchange or to arrange for quotation on any automated dealer
quotation system. The initial purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the notes, but they
are not obligated to do so and may discontinue any market making in the notes at any time, in their sole
discretion. As a result, we cannot assure you as to the liquidity of any trading market for the notes. Accordingly,
you may not be able to sell the notes at a particular time or at favorable prices or at all and you may be required
to bear the financial risk of your investment in the notes indefinitely. If a trading market were to develop, future
trading prices of the notes may be volatile and will depend on many factors, including:

   - our operating performance and financial condition;

   - the interest of securities dealers in making a market for them;

   - prevailing interest rates; and

   - the market for similar securities.

In addition, the market for non-investment grade debt historically has been subject to disruptions that have
caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the notes. The market for the notes, if any, may
be subject to similar disruptions that could adversely affect their value.

**_If a trading market does develop, changes in our credit ratings or the debt markets could adversely affect the_**
**_market price of the notes._**

The price for the notes depends on many factors, including:

   - our credit ratings;

   - prevailing interest rates being paid by, or the market prices for debt securities issued by, other
companies similar to us;

   - our financial condition, financial performance and prospects; and

   - the overall conditions of the general economy and the financial markets.

Credit rating agencies continually revise their ratings for companies they follow, including us. Any ratings
downgrade could adversely affect the trading prices of the notes, or the trading market for the notes, to the extent
a trading market for the notes develops. The conditions of the financial markets and prevailing interest rates have
fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. Such fluctuations could have an adverse effect on
the price of the notes.

**_Holders of the notes will not be entitled to registration rights, and we do not currently intend to register the_**
**_notes under applicable securities laws. There are restrictions on your ability to transfer or resell the notes._**

The notes are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act
and applicable state securities laws and from the prospectus requirement under Canadian Securities Laws, and we
do not currently intend to register or qualify the notes under the Securities Act or any state or foreign securities
laws, or to offer to exchange the notes for registered notes under the Securities Act, or to file a prospectus to
qualify the resale of the notes under Canadian Securities Laws. The holders of the notes will not be entitled to
require us to register the notes for resale or otherwise. Therefore, you may transfer or resell the notes only in a
transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws or
the prospectus requirement under applicable Canadian Securities Laws, and you may be required to bear the risk
of your investment for an indefinite period of time.

**_Under the indenture, the change of control events that would require us to repurchase the notes are subject to_**
**_a number of significant limitations, and certain change of control events that affect the market price of the_**
**_notes may not give rise to any obligation to repurchase the notes._**

Although we will be required under the indenture to make an offer to repurchase the notes upon the
occurrence of certain specified change of control events, the circumstances that could constitute a change of
control trigger event are limited in scope and do not include all change of control events that might affect the
market value of the notes. In particular, we are required to repurchase the notes upon certain change of control
events only if the ratings of the notes are lowered below investment grade during the relevant “trigger period.”
As a result, our obligation to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of a change of control is limited and may
not preserve the value of the notes in the event of a highly leveraged transaction, reorganization, merger or
similar transaction.

**_We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance the change of control offer required by the_**
**_indenture governing the notes._**

Upon the occurrence of one of the specified kinds of “change of control,” as defined in the indenture
governing the notes, we must, if certain other conditions are met, make an offer to repurchase the notes at a price
equal to 101% of the principal amount, together with any accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of the
repurchase. Our failure to purchase, or give notice of purchase of, the notes would be a default under the
indenture governing the notes. See “Description of Notes—Change of Control Triggering Event.”

Furthermore, upon the occurrence of a “change of control” under the Senior Credit Facilities, we must offer
to repay all outstanding debt obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities. Upon the occurrence of a change of
control triggering event under the 2023 Notes Indenture, we must make an offer to repurchase the 2023 Notes at
a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, together with any accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date
of the repurchase. Upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event under the 2026 Notes Indenture,
we will be required to make an offer to repurchase the 2026 Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal
amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase. Upon the occurrence of a change of
control triggering event under the indenture governing the Other Notes, Open Text Holdings, Inc. will be
required to make an offer to repurchase the Other Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase. Under our guarantee of the Other Notes, we will be
obligated to repurchase the Other Notes if Open Text Holdings, Inc. is unable to repurchase them. We cannot
assure you that we will have available funds sufficient to repurchase the notes and satisfy other payment
obligations, including pursuant to the terms of such other securities, that could be triggered upon the change of
control. If we do not have sufficient financial resources to effect a change of control offer, we would be required
to seek additional financing from outside sources to repurchase the notes and satisfy such other payment
obligations. We cannot assure you that financing would be available to us on satisfactory terms, or at all.

The definition of change of control in the indenture governing the notes includes a phrase relating to the
sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer or other disposition of “all or substantially all” of our and our subsidiaries’
assets, taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,”
there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain
circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a
disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a person. As a result, it may be unclear as to
whether a change of control has occurred and whether a holder of notes may require us to make an offer to
repurchase the notes as described above.

**_Management may use the net proceeds of this offering in ways that an investor may not consider desirable._**

We will have broad discretion concerning the use of the net proceeds of this offering, and Open Text
Holdings, Inc. will have broad discretion concerning the use of net proceeds from the Other Notes offering, as
well as the timing of any expenditures. In particular, amounts repaid under the Revolver with the net proceeds of
this offering and the net proceeds from the Other Notes offering may in the future be reborrowed. As a result, a
purchaser of the notes will be relying on the judgment of management with respect to the application of the net
proceeds of this offering and the Other Notes offering. Management may use the net proceeds of this offering and
the Other Notes offering in ways that an investor may not consider desirable. The results and the effectiveness of
the application of the net proceeds from this offering and the Other Notes offering are uncertain. If the net
proceeds from this offering and the Other Notes offering are not applied effectively, our financial performance
and financial condition may be adversely affected and the trading price of the notes could decline.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

Our net proceeds from this offering are expected to be approximately $ million after deduction of the
initial purchasers’ commissions and estimated expenses payable by us in connection with this offering. Our net
proceeds from this offering together with the proceeds from the Other Notes offering are expected to be
approximately $ billion after deduction of the initial purchasers’ commissions and estimated expenses
payable by us and Open Text Holdings, Inc. in connection with the offerings.

We intend to use the substantial portion of the net proceeds from the offerings to refinance $1.55 billion in
outstanding debt, including to redeem in full the outstanding $800 million aggregate principal amount of the
2023 Notes, and to repay the full outstanding $750 million drawn under the Revolver, and we expect to use the
balance of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including potential future acquisitions.

Certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates may hold positions in the 2023 Notes. As a result, certain
of those initial purchasers or their affiliates may receive some of the proceeds from this offering and the Other
Notes offering.

One or more of the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates currently act as lenders under the Revolver
and, as such, will receive a pro rata portion of the net proceeds from this offering and the Other Notes offering
used to reduce amounts outstanding under the Revolver.

The 2023 Notes mature on January 15, 2023 and bear interest at a rate of 5.625% per annum. The Revolver
matures on October 31, 2024. On December 24, 2019, Open Text Holdings, Inc. drew down $750 million under
the Revolver to partially fund the acquisition of Carbonite. The Revolver bears interest per annum at a floating
rate of LIBOR plus a fixed margin dependent on our consolidated net leverage ratio ranging from 1.25% to
1.75%. As of December 31, 2019, the outstanding balance on the Revolver bears an interest rate of
approximately 3.29%.

Neither this offering memorandum nor the offering memorandum for the Other Notes shall constitute a
notice of redemption under the 2023 Notes Indenture. Any such notice, if made, will only be made in accordance
with the provisions of the 2023 Notes Indenture. There can be no assurances as to whether we actually implement
any such redemption.

(1) As a result of our acquisition of Carbonite, our consolidated debt reflects the 2022 Notes issued by
Carbonite. Assuming all holders convert at the temporarily increased conversion rate, the make-whole
premium on the 2022 Notes as of December 31, 2019 would be $9,881,000. As of January 31, 2020,
approximately $140 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 notes had elected to convert for cash,
with the Company settling such conversions utilizing cash on hand. See “Description of Other
Indebtedness—2022 Notes.”
(2) As of December 31, 2019, we had $750 million borrowings under our $750 million Revolver. Borrowings
under the Revolver are secured by a first charge over substantially all of our assets. Amounts repaid under
the Revolver with the net proceeds of this offering and the Other Notes offering may in the future be
reborrowed.

**DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS**

**Senior Unsecured Fixed Rate Notes**

**Concurrent Offering**

Prior to, substantially concurrently with or shortly after this offering of the notes, under a separate offering
memorandum, Open Text Holdings, Inc. expects to have offered or to be offering $ million aggregate
principal amount of % Senior Notes due 2030. The aggregate principal amount of this offering, together with
the Other Notes offering, is expected to be approximately $1.6 billion. We will guarantee the Other Notes. The
terms under the indenture governing the Other Notes governing change of control triggering events and
repurchase of the Other Notes, and the covenants placing limitations on liens, incurring or guaranteeing
additional indebtedness, and consolidation, amalgamation and merger, are substantially the same as under the
indenture governing these notes. The terms under the indenture governing the Other Notes related to optional
redemption provide that Open Text Holdings, Inc., on one or more occasions, may redeem the Other Notes, in
whole or in part, at any time on and after, 2025 at the applicable redemption prices set forth in the
indenture governing the Other Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. Open Text
Holdings, Inc. may also redeem all or a portion of the Other Notes at any time prior to, 2025 at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Other Notes plus an applicable premium, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. In addition, the Open Text Holdings, Inc. may, also
redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Other Notes, on one or more occasions, prior
to, 2025, at the applicable redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the Other Notes,
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date.

If we experience one of the kinds of changes of control triggering events specified in the indenture
governing the Other Notes, we will be required to make an offer to repurchase the Other Notes at a price equal to
101% of the principal amount of the Other Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of
purchase.

The completion of this offering and the completion of the Other Notes offering are not conditioned upon one
another.

Information regarding the Other Notes in this offering memorandum is neither an offer to sell nor a
solicitation of an offer to buy the Other Notes, or any other securities.

**2026 Notes**

On May 31, 2016 we issued $600 million in aggregate principal amount of 2026 Notes in an unregistered
offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A, and to certain non-U.S. persons in offshore
transactions pursuant to Regulation S. The 2026 Notes were issued under an Indenture (the “2026 Notes
Indenture”) among the Company, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto, The Bank of New York Mellon, as U.S.
trustee, and BNY Trust Company of Canada, as Canadian trustee. The 2026 Notes bear interest at a rate of
5.875% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1. The 2026 Notes will mature on
June 1, 2026, unless earlier redeemed, in accordance with their terms, or repurchased.

On December 20, 2016, we issued an additional $250 million in aggregate principal amount by reopening
the 2026 Notes at an issue price of 102.75%. The additional notes have identical terms, are fungible with and are
a part of a single series with the previously issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes.
The outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes, after taking into consideration the additional
issuance, is $850 million in aggregate principal amount.

We may redeem all or a portion of the 2026 Notes at any time prior to June 1, 2021 at a redemption price
equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2026 Notes plus an applicable premium, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to the redemption date. We may, on one or more occasions, redeem the 2026 Notes, in whole or

33


-----

in part, at any time on and after June 1, 2021 at the applicable redemption prices set forth in the 2026 Notes
Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date.

If we experience one of the kinds of changes of control triggering events specified in the 2026 Notes
Indenture, we will be required to make an offer to repurchase the 2026 Notes at a price equal to 101% of the
principal amount of the 2026 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase.

The 2026 Notes Indenture contains covenants that limit our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to, among
other things: (i) create certain liens and enter into sale and lease-back transactions; (ii) create, assume, incur or
guarantee additional indebtedness of the Company or the guarantors without such subsidiary becoming a
subsidiary guarantor of the notes; and (iii) consolidate, amalgamate or merge with, or convey, transfer, lease or
otherwise dispose of its property and assets substantially as an entirety to, another person. These covenants are
subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions as set forth in the 2026 Notes Indenture. The 2026
Notes Indenture also provides for events of default, which, if any of them occurs, may permit or, in certain
circumstances, require the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the thenoutstanding notes to be due and payable immediately.

The 2026 Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by our existing and future wholly-owned
subsidiaries that borrow or guarantee the obligations under our existing Senior Credit Facilities. The 2026 Notes
and the guarantees rank equally in right of payment with all of our and our guarantors’ existing and future senior
unsubordinated debt and will rank senior in right of payment to all of our and our guarantors’ future subordinated
debt. The 2026 Notes and the guarantees will be effectively subordinated to all of our and our guarantors’
existing and future secured debt, including the obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities, to the extent of the
value of the assets securing such secured debt.

**2023 Notes**

On January 15, 2015, we issued $800 million in aggregate principal amount of 2023 Notes in an
unregistered offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A and to certain non-U.S. persons in
offshore transactions pursuant to Regulation S. The 2023 Notes were issued under an Indenture (the “2023 Notes
Indenture”) among the Company, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto, Citibank, N.A., as U.S. trustee, and Citi
Trust Company Canada, as Canadian trustee. The 2023 Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.625% per annum,
payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15. The 2023 Notes will mature on January 15, 2023,
unless earlier redeemed, in accordance with their terms, or repurchased. Under the terms of the 2023 Notes
Indenture, we may, on one or more occasions, redeem the 2023 Notes, in whole or in part, at any time at the
applicable redemption prices set forth in the 2023 Notes Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the
redemption date. We plan to redeem the 2023 Notes with the net proceeds of this offering and the Other Notes
offering. This offering memorandum and the offering memorandum for the Other Notes shall not constitute a
notice of redemption under the 2023 Notes Indenture. Any such notice, if made, will only be made in accordance
with the provisions of the 2023 Notes Indenture. There can be no assurances as to whether we actually implement
any such redemption.

If we experience one of the kinds of changes of control triggering events specified in the 2023 Notes
Indenture, we will be required to make an offer to repurchase the 2023 Notes at a price equal to 101% of the
principal amount of the 2023 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase.

The 2023 Notes Indenture contains covenants that limit our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to, among
other things: (i) create certain liens and enter into sale and lease-back transactions; (ii) in the case of our
non-guarantor subsidiaries, create, assume, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness of the Company or the
subsidiary guarantors without such subsidiary becoming a subsidiary guarantor of the 2023 Notes; and
(iii) consolidate, amalgamate or merge with, or convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of its property and
assets substantially as an entirety to, another person. These covenants are subject to a number of important
limitations and exceptions as set forth in the 2023 Notes Indenture. The 2023 Notes Indenture also provides for

34


-----

events of default, which, if any of them occurs, may permit or, in certain circumstances, require the principal,
premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then-outstanding notes to be due and
payable immediately.

The 2023 Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by our existing and future wholly-owned
subsidiaries that borrow or guarantee the obligations under our existing Senior Credit Facilities. The 2023 Notes
and the guarantees rank equally in right of payment with all of our and our subsidiary guarantors’ existing and
future senior unsubordinated debt and will rank senior in right of payment to all of our and our subsidiary
guarantors’ future subordinated debt. The 2023 Notes and the guarantees are effectively subordinated to all of our
and our guarantors’ existing and future secured debt, including the obligations under the Revolver and the 2018
Credit Facility, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such secured debt.

**2022 Notes**

As a result of our acquisition of Carbonite, our consolidated debt reflects $143.8 million aggregate principal
amount of the 2022 Notes. The 2022 Notes were originally issued by Carbonite, on April 4, 2017, in an
unregistered offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act . The 2022
Notes were issued under an Indenture (the “2022 Notes Indenture”) between Carbonite and U.S. Bank National
Association, as trustee (the “2022 Notes Trustee”). The 2022 Notes accrue interest at 2.5% per year, payable
semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The 2022 Notes will mature on April 1, 2022,
unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Carbonite, now a subsidiary of OpenText, remains the sole
obligor on the 2022 Notes.

In connection with our acquisition of Carbonite, and as required by the 2022 Notes Indenture, Carbonite and
the 2022 Notes Trustee entered into a first supplemental indenture, dated as of December 24, 2019 (the “2022
Notes Supplemental Indenture”). The 2022 Notes Supplemental Indenture provides that, at and after the effective
time of our acquisition of Carbonite, the right to convert each $1,000 principal amount of the 2022 Notes was
changed into the right to convert such principal amount of the 2022 Notes solely into cash in an amount equal to
the Conversion Rate (as defined in the 2022 Notes Indenture) in effect on the Conversion Date (as defined in the
2022 Notes Indenture) multiplied by $23.00, which was the price per share we paid in connection with our
acquisition of Carbonite.

As a result of our acquisition of Carbonite, the Conversion Rate for the 2022 Notes was temporarily
increased by 7.7633 per $1,000 principal amount of the 2022 Notes to yield a Conversion Rate of 46.4667 per
$1,000 principal amount of the 2022 Notes. The increased Conversion Rate will remain in effect until the close
of business (5:00 P.M. New York City time) on February 27, 2020. During the period between our acquisition of
Carbonite and that date, each $1,000 principal amount of the 2022 Notes surrendered for conversion will be
converted into $1,068.7341 in cash. Assuming all holders convert at the temporarily increased conversion rate,
the make-whole premium on 2022 Notes as of December 31, 2019 would have been $9,881,000. As of
January 31, 2020, approximately $140 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 notes had elected to
convert for cash, with the Company settling such conversions utilizing cash on hand.

**Revolver**

On October 31, 2019, our existing credit agreement was amended and restated in the form of a new
$750 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolver”). The Revolver was entered into by and among Open Text
ULC, Open Text Holdings, Inc. and Open Text Corporation, as borrowers, the guarantors party thereto, the
lenders party thereto, Barclays Bank PLC, as administrative agent, collateral agent and swing line lender, and
Royal Bank of Canada, as documentary credit lender. The amendments increased the facility size from
$450 million to $750 million, as well as extended the maturity date from May 5, 2022 to October 31, 2024.

Borrowings under the Revolver are secured by a first charge over substantially all of our assets, and on a
pari passu basis with 2018 Credit Facility. The Revolver has a repayment date of October 31, 2024. Borrowings

35


-----

under the Revolver bear interest at a rate per annum equal to an applicable margin plus, at the borrower’s option,
either (1) the Eurodollar rate for the interest period relevant to such borrowing or (2) an ABR rate determined by
reference to the greater of (i) the Prime Rate (as defined therein), (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% per annum
and (iii) the one month Eurodollar rate plus 1.00% per annum. The applicable margin for borrowings under the
Revolver depends on our consolidated net leverage ratio and ranges from 1.25% to 1.75% with respect to LIBOR
advances and 0.25% to 0.75% with respect to ABR advances. As of December 31, 2019, the outstanding balance
on the Revolver bears an interest rate of approximately 3.29%.

Under the Revolver, we must maintain a “consolidated net leverage” ratio (defined in the same manner as
the 2018 Credit Facility, as further described below) of no more than 4:1 at the end of each financial quarter.

We intend to use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering and the Other Notes offering to repay the
$750 million of outstanding indebtedness under the Revolver, and amounts repaid under the Revolver may in the
future be reborrowed.

**2018 Credit Facility**

On May 30, 2018, our existing term loan credit agreement was amended and restated in the form of a new
$1 billion term loan facility with certain lenders named therein, Barclays Bank PLC, as sole administrative agent,
collateral agent and lead arranger (the “2018 Credit Facility” and together with the Revolver, the “Senior Credit
Facilities”) and borrowed the full amount on May 30, 2018 to, among other things, repay in full the loans under
our prior $800 million term loan credit facility originally entered into on January 16, 2014. Repayments made
under the 2018 Credit Facility are equal to 0.25% of the principal amount in equal quarterly installments for the
life of the 2018 Credit Facility, with the remainder due at maturity.

Borrowings under the 2018 Credit Facility are secured by a first charge over substantially all of our assets
on a pari passu basis with the Revolver. The 2018 Credit Facility has a seven year term.

Borrowings under the 2018 Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to an applicable margin
plus, at the borrower’s option, either (1) the Eurodollar rate for the interest period relevant to such borrowing or
(2) an ABR rate determined by reference to the greater of (i) the Prime Rate (as defined therein), (ii) the federal
funds rate plus 0.50% per annum and (iii) the one month Eurodollar rate plus 1.00% per annum. The applicable
margin for borrowings under the 2018 Credit Facility is 1.75%, with respect to LIBOR advances and 0.75%, with
respect to ABR advances. The interest on the current outstanding balance for the 2018 Credit Facility is equal to
1.75% plus LIBOR (subject to a 0.00% floor). As of December 31, 2019, the outstanding balance on the 2018
Credit Facility bears an interest rate of approximately 3.45%.

The 2018 Credit Facility has incremental facility capacity of (i) $250 million plus (ii) additional amounts,
subject to meeting a “consolidated senior secured net leverage” ratio not exceeding 2.75:1.00, in each case
subject to certain conditions. Consolidated senior secured net leverage ratio is defined for this purpose as the
proportion of our total debt reduced by unrestricted cash, including guarantees and letters of credit, that is
secured by our or any of our subsidiaries’ assets, over our trailing twelve months net income before interest,
taxes, depreciation, amortization, restructuring, share-based compensation and other miscellaneous charges.

Under the 2018 Credit Facility, we must maintain a “consolidated net leverage” ratio of no more than 4:1 at
the end of each financial quarter. Consolidated net leverage ratio is defined for this purpose as the proportion of
our total debt reduced by unrestricted cash, including guarantees and letters of credit, over our trailing twelve
months net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, restructuring, share-based compensation and
other miscellaneous charges. As of December 31, 2019, our consolidated net leverage ratio was 2.3:1.

**DESCRIPTION OF NOTES**

_The following description is a summary of the terms and provisions of the notes and the Indenture (as_
_defined below) governing the notes. It summarizes only those portions of the Indenture that we believe will be_
_most important to your decision to invest in the notes. You should keep in mind, however, that it is the Indenture,_
_and not this summary, which will define your rights as a holder of the notes. There may be other provisions in the_
_Indenture which are also important to you. You should read the Indenture and the notes for a full description of_
_the terms of the notes. See “Incorporation by Reference” for information on how to obtain copies of the_
_Indenture. Certain terms used in this description are defined under the subheading “—Certain Definitions.”_
_Unless the context otherwise requires, in this section, the words “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer only_
_to Open Text Corporation and not any of its subsidiaries._

**General**

We will issue the notes under an indenture, dated the Issue Date (the “Indenture”), among us, the subsidiary
guarantors party thereto, The Bank of New York Mellon, as U.S. trustee (the “U.S. Trustee”), and BNY Trust
Company of Canada, as Canadian trustee (the “Canadian Trustee” and, together with the U.S. Trustee, the
“Trustees”). The Indenture does not limit the maximum aggregate principal amount of notes we may issue
thereunder. We will issue up to $ million aggregate principal amount of % senior notes due 2028 (the
“notes”) in this offering.

We may from time to time without notice to, or the consent of, the holders of the notes, create and issue
additional notes under the Indenture (“additional notes”), that will be equal in rank to the notes in all respects (or
in all respects except for the payment of interest accruing prior to the issue date of the additional notes, or except
for the first payment of interest following the issue date of the additional notes) so that the additional notes may
be consolidated and form a single series with the existing notes and have the same terms as to status, redemption
and otherwise as the notes offered under this Offering Memorandum; provided, however, that unless such
additional notes are issued under a separate CUSIP, either such additional notes are part of the same “issue” for
U.S. federal income tax purposes or are issued pursuant to a “qualified reopening” for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. The notes (including any additional notes) will vote on and consent to all matters arising under the
Indenture or the notes as a single class.

The notes will be issued in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof and
will be represented by one or more registered notes in global form, but in certain limited circumstances may be
represented by notes in definitive form. See “—Book-Entry Delivery and Form” below.

For purposes of the Interest Act (Canada), whenever any interest or fee under the notes or the Indenture is
calculated using a rate based on a number of days less than a full year, such rate determined pursuant to such
calculation, when expressed as an annual rate, is equivalent to (x) the applicable rate, (y) multiplied by the actual
number of days in the calendar year in which the period for which such interest or fee is payable (or
compounded) ends, and (z) divided by the number of days based on which such rate is calculated. The principle
of deemed reinvestment of interest does not apply to any interest calculation under the notes or the Indenture.
The rates of interest stipulated in the notes and the Indenture are intended to be nominal rates and not effective
rates or yields.

**Terms of the Notes**

Principal and interest on the notes will be payable in lawful money of the United States. On maturity or
redemption of the notes, we will repay the indebtedness represented by such notes by paying the U.S. Trustee in
lawful money of the United States an amount equal to the principal amount of the outstanding notes, plus any
accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the date of maturity or redemption, as the case may be.
Interest on the notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. The notes will be
subject to redemption only in the circumstances and upon the terms described under “—Optional Redemption.”

37


-----

The notes will mature on, 2028. The notes will bear interest at the rate per annum of %, which
will be payable semi-annually on and of each year, commencing on, 2020, to the
persons in whose names the notes are registered at the close of business on the preceding or, as the
case may be.

Each note will bear interest from the Issue Date. If an interest payment date for the notes falls on a day that
is not a Business Day, the interest payment shall be postponed to the next succeeding Business Day as if made on
the date such payment was due, and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the period from and after such
interest payment date to such next succeeding Business Day.

**Ranking**

The notes will:

   - be our general unsecured senior obligations;

   - rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsubordinated obligations;

   - rank senior in right of payment to all of our future subordinated indebtedness;

   - be effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness (including our
guarantee of the Senior Credit Facilities) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such secured
indebtedness; and

   - be structurally subordinated to all existing or future indebtedness of any of our subsidiaries that are not
subsidiary guarantors.

Each subsidiary guarantee of the notes will:

   - be the unsecured senior obligation of the applicable subsidiary guarantor;

   - rank equally in right of payment with all of the existing and future unsubordinated obligations of the
subsidiary guarantor;

   - rank senior in right of payment to all of the future subordinated indebtedness of the subsidiary
guarantor;

   - be effectively subordinated to all of the existing and future secured indebtedness of the subsidiary
guarantor (including such subsidiary guarantor’s guarantee of the Senior Credit Facilities), to the extent
of the value of the assets securing such secured indebtedness; and

   - be structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness of any subsidiary of a subsidiary
guarantor that is not also a subsidiary guarantor.

As of December 31, 2019, after giving effect to this offering of the notes, the Other Notes offering and the
use of the net proceeds from this offering and from the Other Notes offering:

   - we and the subsidiary guarantors would have had $ billion of total indebtedness; $982.5 million, of
which would have consisted of secured indebtedness under the 2018 Credit Facility; $850 million
aggregate principal amount of which would have consisted of our outstanding 2026 Notes;
$143.8 million aggregate principal amount of which would have consisted of the 2022 Notes;
$ million aggregate principal amount of which would have consisted of the Other Notes and
$ million aggregate principal amount of which would have consisted of the notes offered hereby.

   - we would have had $750 million available for borrowing under the Revolver (exclusive of any letters of
credit outstanding, which reduce the amount available), which, if borrowed, would be senior secured
indebtedness; and

   - our subsidiaries that are not subsidiary guarantors would not have had any long-term debt.

38


-----

For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 and six months ended December 31, 2019, our subsidiaries that are
not subsidiary guarantors:

   - accounted for approximately $1,337 million and $728.2 million, or 46.6% and 49.6%, respectively, of
our consolidated revenue (after giving effect to intercompany eliminations);

   - accounted for approximately $157.6 million and $75.8 million, or 14.3% and 13.3%, respectively, of our
consolidated Adjusted EBITDA;

   - accounted for approximately $1,723 million and $3,254 million, or 21.7% and 34.3%, respectively, of
our consolidated total assets (excluding intercompany assets); and

   - did not have any long-term debt.

The Indenture will not limit us or our subsidiary guarantors from incurring additional indebtedness (other
than secured indebtedness) under the Indenture, the indenture governing the Other Notes, or any other financing
agreement that we may enter into in the future.

See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—We, including our subsidiaries,
have the ability to incur substantially more indebtedness, including senior secured indebtedness, which could
further increase the risks associated with our leverage” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness
and the Notes—The notes will be structurally subordinated to all indebtedness of our existing subsidiaries that
are not guarantors of the notes and our future subsidiaries that do not become guarantors of the notes; each of the
guarantors may be released upon the occurrence of certain conditions.”

**Listing of the Notes**

We do not intend to apply for the listing of the notes on any securities exchange or for the quotation of the
notes in any dealer quotation system. The notes are new securities for which there is currently no established
trading market. Additionally, the Indenture will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act. We cannot assure
you that any active or liquid market will develop for the notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our
Indebtedness and the Notes—There is no established trading market for the notes and you may not be able to sell
the notes readily or at or above the price that you paid or at all” and “Plan of Distribution.”

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth below, we will not be entitled to redeem the notes at our option prior to, 2023.

On and after, 2023, we will be entitled at our option on one or more occasions to redeem all or a
portion of the notes (which, for the avoidance of doubt, includes additional notes, if any) at the redemption prices
(expressed in percentages of principal amount on the redemption date), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
to the redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due
on the relevant interest payment date), if redeemed during the 12-month period commencing on of the
years set forth below:

**Period** **Redemption price**

In addition, any time prior to, 2023, we will be entitled at our option on one or more occasions to
redeem the notes (which, for the avoidance of doubt, includes additional notes, if any) in an aggregate principal
amount not to exceed 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes (which, for the avoidance of doubt,

39


-----

includes additional notes, if any) originally issued at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal
amount) of %, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date (subject to the right of holders
of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), with the net
cash proceeds from one or more Qualified Equity Offerings; provided, however, that

(1) at least 50% of such aggregate principal amount of notes (excluding any additional notes, if any)
originally issued under the Indenture remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of each such
redemption; and

(2) each such redemption occurs within 90 days after the date of the related Qualified Equity Offering.

Prior to, 2023, we will be entitled at our option to redeem all or a portion of the notes (which, for
the avoidance of doubt, includes additional notes, if any) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal
amount of the notes plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, the
redemption date (subject to the right of holders on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant
interest payment date).

Any redemption may, at our discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, which will be set
forth in the related notice of redemption, including, but not limited to, completion of a Qualified Equity Offering,
other offering or financing or other transaction or event. In addition, if such redemption is subject to satisfaction
of one or more conditions precedent, such notice will describe each such condition, and if applicable, will state
that, in our discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time (provided, however, that any
redemption date will not be more than 60 days after the date of the notice of redemption) as any or all such
conditions will be satisfied, or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that
any or all such conditions will not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption date as so
delayed. If any such condition precedent has not been satisfied, we will provide written notice to the Trustees
prior to the close of business one Business Day prior to the redemption date. Upon receipt of such notice, the
notice of redemption will be rescinded or delayed, and the redemption of the notes will be rescinded or delayed
as provided in such notice. Upon receipt, the U.S. Trustee will provide such notice to each holder of the notes in
the same manner in which the notice of redemption was given.

**Selection and Notice of Redemption**

If we are redeeming less than all the notes at any time, selection of the notes for redemption will be made in
compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange, if any, on which the notes are
listed or, if the notes are not listed but are in global form, then by lot or otherwise in accordance with the
procedures of The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) or, if the notes are not listed and not in global form on a
pro rata basis, by lot or by such other method as the U.S. Trustee in its sole discretion will deem to be fair and
appropriate, although no note of $2,000 in original principal amount or less will be redeemed in part.

We will redeem notes of $2,000 or less in whole and not in part. We will cause notices of redemption to be
mailed by first-class mail (or otherwise delivered in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC) at least
15 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of notes to be redeemed at its registered
address, except that redemption notices may be mailed (or otherwise delivered in accordance with the applicable
procedures of DTC) more than 60 days prior to the redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a
defeasance of the notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture. Any inadvertent defect in the notice of
redemption, including an inadvertent failure to give notice, to any holder selected for redemption will not impair
or affect the validity of the redemption of any other note redeemed in accordance with provisions of the
Indenture.

If any note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that note will state the
portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. Notes called for redemption become due on the date

40


-----

fixed for redemption. With respect to registered notes issued in global form, the principal amount of such note or
notes will be adjusted in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC. Notes held in certificated form must
be surrendered to the paying agent in order to collect the redemption price. Unless the Company defaults in the
payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on notes or portions
of them called for redemption.

**Redemption for Changes in Withholding Taxes**

The notes may be redeemed, at the option of the Company, in whole but not in part, at any time upon giving
not less than 15 nor more than 60 days’ written notice to the holders of the notes (which notice shall be
irrevocable), at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to the date fixed by the Company for redemption (the “Tax Redemption Date”) if, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the laws or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation (including a
proposed change or amendment that, if enacted, will be effective prior to the enactment date); or

(2) any change in the existing official position regarding the application, administration or interpretation of
such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including a holding, judgment or order by a court of
competent jurisdiction),

which change, amendment, application, administration or interpretation is announced or becomes effective on or
after the Issue Date, the Company or any subsidiary guarantor, as the case may be, is, or on the next interest
payment date would be, required to pay any Additional Amounts (as defined below) with respect to any payment
due or becoming due under the notes or the Indenture and such requirement cannot be avoided by the taking of
reasonable measures by the Company or a subsidiary guarantor, as determined in good faith by the relevant
Board of Directors.

Prior to the publication and mailing of any notice of redemption of the notes pursuant to the foregoing
paragraph, the Company will deliver to the Trustees an Opinion of Counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustees
and setting forth in reasonable detail the circumstances giving rise to such right of redemption pursuant to clause
(1) or (2) above. Any notes that are redeemed will be cancelled.

**Mandatory Redemption; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases**

We are not required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the notes.
However, under certain circumstances, we may be required to offer to purchase notes as described under
“—Change of Control Triggering Event.” We may at any time and from time to time purchase notes in the open
market or otherwise.

**Payment of Additional Amounts**

The Indenture will provide that the Company and any subsidiary guarantor is required to make all payments
on the notes free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for or on account of any present or future tax,
duty, levy, impost, assessment or other governmental charge (including penalties, interest and other liabilities
related thereto) (hereinafter “Taxes”) imposed or levied by or on behalf of the government of the country in
which the Company or subsidiary guarantor and any successor thereof is organized or incorporated or any
political subdivision or any authority or agency therein or thereof having power to tax, or any other jurisdiction
in which the Company or any subsidiary guarantor is otherwise resident for tax purposes or the jurisdiction of
any paying agent (each, a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”), unless the Company or a subsidiary guarantor or
paying agent is required to withhold or deduct Taxes by law or by the interpretation or administration thereof.

If the Company, or any subsidiary guarantor, or a paying agent is so required to withhold or deduct any
amount for or on account of Taxes imposed by a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from any payment made under or

41


-----

with respect to the notes, the Company or any subsidiary guarantor will be required to pay such additional
amounts (“Additional Amounts”) with respect to the notes as may be necessary so that the net amount received
by any holder or beneficial owner (including Additional Amounts) after such withholding or deduction will not
be less than the amount such holder or beneficial owner would have received if such Taxes had not been withheld
or deducted; provided, however, that the foregoing obligation to pay Additional Amounts does not apply to:

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former
connection between the relevant holder or beneficial owner and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
(including a connection between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, partner, member or shareholder of, or
possessor of power over, the relevant holder or beneficial owner, if the relevant holder or beneficial
owner is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership or corporation, and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction)
including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, such holder or beneficial owner (or such
fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, partner, member, shareholder, or possessor) of the notes being or having
been a citizen, resident, or national thereof or being or having been present or engaged in a trade or
business therein or having or having had a permanent establishment therein;

(2) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer or personal property tax or similar Taxes;

(3) any withholding or deduction in respect of the notes (a) presented for payment by or on behalf of a
holder or beneficial owner who would have been able to avoid such withholding or deduction by
presenting the relevant note to any other paying agent, or (b) where the payment could have been made
without such deduction or withholding if the beneficiary of the payment had presented the notes for
payment within 30 days after the date on which such payment on the notes became due and payable or
the date on which payment thereof is duly provided for, whichever is later (except to the extent that the
holder or beneficial owner would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the notes been
presented on the last day of such 30-day period);

(4) any Taxes imposed with respect to any payment of principal (or premium, if any) or interest on the
notes by the Company or any subsidiary guarantor to any holder or beneficial owner who is a fiduciary
or partnership or any Person other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment, to the extent that a
beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary, a member of such a partnership or the beneficial
owner of such payment would not have been entitled to the Additional Amounts had such beneficiary,
settlor, member or beneficial owner been the actual holder or beneficial owner of such notes;

(5) any Taxes that are payable other than by deduction or withholding from payments made under or with
respect to the notes;

(6) any Taxes that would not have been imposed but for the failure of the holder and/or beneficial owner to
comply with the Company’s or the paying agent’s request in writing at least 30 days before any
withholding for such Taxes to the holder to provide certification, documentation, information or other
evidence concerning the nationality, residence, entitlement to treaty benefits, identity, direct or indirect
ownership of or investment in the notes, or connection with the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction of the
holder and/or beneficial owner of such notes, or (b) to make any valid or timely declaration or similar
claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement or to provide any information relating to such matters,
whether required or imposed by statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction, as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of withholding or
deduction of, Taxes imposed by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction;

(7) any Taxes that are required to be deducted or withheld from any payment under or in respect of the
notes as a consequence of the holder or beneficial owner of notes or the recipient of the interest payable
on the notes not dealing at arm’s length (within the meaning of the Income Tax Act (Canada)) with the
Company or any subsidiary guarantor at the time of making any such payment;

(8) any Taxes that are required to be deducted or withheld from any payment under or in respect of the
notes as a consequence of the holder or beneficial owner of the notes being at any time a “specified
non-resident shareholder” (within the meaning of subsection 18(5) of the Income Tax Act (Canada)) of

42


-----

the Company or at any time not dealing at arm’s length (within the meaning of the Income Tax Act
(Canada)) with a “specified shareholder” (within the meaning of subsection 18(5) of the Income Tax
Act (Canada)) of the Company or as a consequence of the payment being deemed to be a dividend
under the Income Tax Act (Canada);

(9) any Taxes payable under section 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the “Code”) (or any successor or amended versions thereof), any regulations or other official
guidance thereunder, or any agreement (including any intergovernmental agreement or any law
implementing such governmental agreement) entered into in connection therewith (“FATCA”);

(10) any Taxes or penalties arising from the holder’s or beneficial owner’s failure to comply with the
holder’s or beneficial owner’s obligations imposed under Part XVIII of the Income Tax Act (Canada),
the Canada-United States Enhanced Tax Information Exchange Agreement Implementation Act
(Canada) or the similar provisions of legislation of any other jurisdiction that has entered into an
agreement with the United States of America to provide for the implementation of FATCA based
reporting; or

(11) any combination of, or any Taxes arising from a combination of the factors described in, (1) to (10)
above.

At least 30 calendar days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the notes is due
and payable (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises shortly before or after the 30th day prior to
such date, in which case it shall be promptly thereafter), if the Company or any subsidiary guarantor will be
obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to such payment, the Company will deliver to the U.S. Trustee
and paying agent for the affected notes an Officers’ Certificate stating the fact that such Additional Amounts will
be payable and the amounts so payable and will set forth such other information necessary to enable the U.S.
Trustee or paying agent, as the case may be, to pay such Additional Amounts to holders and beneficial owners of
such notes on the payment date. Each such Officers’ Certificate shall be relied upon until receipt of a further
Officers’ Certificate addressing such matters.

The Company or the applicable subsidiary guarantor will also (i) make such withholding or deduction and
(ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant authority in accordance with applicable law. The
Company will provide the U.S. Trustee with official receipts or, if, notwithstanding the efforts of the Company,
official receipts are not obtainable, other documentation reasonably satisfactory to the U.S. Trustee, evidencing
the payment of any Tax so deducted or withheld for each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes. The
Company will attach to each official receipt or other documentation a certificate stating (x) that the amount of
such Tax evidenced by the official receipt or other documentation was paid in connection with payments in
respect of the principal amount of such notes then outstanding and (y) the amount of such Tax paid per $1,000 of
principal amount of such notes.

Whenever reference is made in the Indenture, in any context, to:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) redemption prices or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to the notes,

such reference will be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts as described under this heading to the
extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Company will pay any present or future stamp, court, documentary or other similar taxes, charges or
levies that arise in any jurisdiction from the execution, delivery or registration of, or enforcement of rights under,
the indenture or any related document.

43


-----

The obligations described under this heading (and the redemption rights described under the heading
“Redemption for Changes in Withholding Taxes”) will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the
Indenture and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor Person to the Company or
any subsidiary guarantor is organized or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Subsidiary Guarantees**

Each subsidiary that is a borrower under, or guarantees the obligations under, the Senior Credit Facilities
will guarantee the notes on the Issue Date. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the
Notes—The notes will be structurally subordinated to all indebtedness of our existing subsidiaries that are not
guarantors of the notes and our future subsidiaries that do not become guarantors of the notes; each of the
guarantors may be released upon the occurrence of certain conditions.” One or more of our other subsidiaries
may be required to become a subsidiary guarantor to the extent required under “—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Non-Guarantor Subsidiary Debt.” We may elect to make any subsidiary a subsidiary guarantor.

The subsidiary guarantors will jointly and severally guarantee, on a senior unsecured basis, our obligations
under the indenture and the notes. The obligations of each subsidiary guarantor under its subsidiary guarantee are
designed to be limited as necessary to prevent that subsidiary guarantee from constituting a fraudulent
conveyance or voidable transaction under applicable law, and, therefore, such subsidiary guarantee is specifically
limited to an amount that such subsidiary guarantor could guarantee without such subsidiary guarantee
constituting a fraudulent conveyance or voidable transaction. This limitation, however, may not be effective to
prevent such subsidiary guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or voidable transaction under
applicable law. The guarantees of our foreign subsidiary guarantors may also be subject to significant limitations
under applicable laws governing such subsidiary guarantor and guarantees of any future foreign subsidiary
guarantors may also be significantly limited under applicable laws. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our
Indebtedness and the Notes—Under certain circumstances a court could cancel or void the notes and/or the
related guarantees. If that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the notes and/or the guarantees” and
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—Each subsidiary guarantor’s liability under its
guarantees may be significantly limited, voided or released under certain circumstances such that you may not
receive any payments from some or all of the subsidiary guarantors.”

Each subsidiary guarantor that makes a payment under its subsidiary guarantee will be entitled upon
payment in full of all guaranteed obligations under the Indenture to a contribution from each other subsidiary
guarantor in an amount equal to such other subsidiary guarantor’s pro rata portion of such payment based on the
respective net assets of all the subsidiary guarantors at the time of such payment determined in accordance with
GAAP.

The subsidiary guarantee of a subsidiary guarantor will be automatically released upon:

(1) (a) the release of such subsidiary guarantor from its obligations in respect of its obligations as a
guarantor under our Senior Credit Facilities or in respect of such other debt that caused it to become a subsidiary
guarantor under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Non-Guarantor Subsidiary Debt,” so long as such
subsidiary guarantor would not then otherwise be required to be a subsidiary guarantor pursuant to such
covenant;

(b) the sale, issuance or other disposition of Capital Stock of such subsidiary guarantor (including by way of
merger, amalgamation or consolidation) such that such subsidiary guarantor ceases to be a subsidiary of the
Company, or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of such subsidiary guarantor to a Person that is not
(either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Company or a subsidiary, so long as such sale,
issuance or other disposition of Capital Stock is not prohibited by the terms of the Indenture;

(c) immediately prior to or following the dissolution of such subsidiary guarantor; or

44


-----

(d) the Company exercising its defeasance or covenant defeasance option as described under “—Defeasance
and Covenant Defeasance” or if the Company’s obligations under the Indenture are discharged in accordance
with the terms of the Indenture; and

(2) the Company or such subsidiary guarantor delivering to the Trustees an Officers’ Certificate and an
Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions provided for in the Indenture relating to such transaction
have been complied with, except in the case of a merger, consolidation or amalgamation of a subsidiary
guarantor into or with the Company.

**Change of Control Triggering Event**

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, each holder shall have the right to require
that the Company repurchase such holder’s notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal
amount thereof on the date of purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of
purchase (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
relevant interest payment date).

Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event unless we have previously or
concurrently mailed a redemption notice with respect to all outstanding notes as described under “—Optional
Redemption,” we will mail a notice by first-class mail (or otherwise delivered in accordance with the applicable
procedures of DTC) to each holder with copies to the Trustees (the “Change of Control Offer”) stating:

(a) that a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred and that such holder has the right to require us to
purchase such holder’s notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof on the
date of purchase, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase (subject to the
right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment
date);

(b) the circumstances and relevant facts regarding such Change of Control Triggering Event;

(c) an expiration date (which shall be no earlier than 15 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice
is mailed, the “expiration date”) and a settlement date for purchase (the “purchase date”) not more than five
Business Days after the expiration date; and

(d) the instructions, as determined by us, consistent with the covenant described hereunder, that a holder
must follow in order to have its notes purchased.

A holder may tender all or any portion of its notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer, subject to the
requirement that any portion of a note tendered must be in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of
$1,000 in excess thereof. Holders are entitled to withdraw notes tendered up to the close of business on the
expiration date. On the purchase date, the purchase price will become due and payable on each note accepted for
purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, and interest on notes purchased will cease to accrue on and
after the purchase date.

We will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control Triggering Event
if: (a) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance
with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by us and
purchases all notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (b) a notice of
redemption that is or has become unconditional has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described above
under the caption “—Optional Redemption.”

If holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes validly tender and do
not withdraw such notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer and the Company, or any third party making a

45


-----

Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Company as described above, purchases all of the notes validly tendered
and not withdrawn by such holders, the Company will have the right, upon not less than 15 nor more than 60
days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer,
to redeem all notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of
the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase
(subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date).

A Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event, conditional
upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control Triggering Event at
the time of making of the Change of Control Offer.

We will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and
any other securities laws or regulations, including Canadian Securities Laws, in connection with the repurchase
of notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities
laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the covenant described hereunder, we will comply with the
applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached our obligations under the
covenant described hereunder by virtue of our compliance with such securities laws or regulations.

The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature of the notes may in certain circumstances make it
more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of the Company and, thus, the removal of incumbent management.
The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Company and
the initial purchasers. We have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control
Triggering Event, although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations
discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or
other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Indenture, but
that could increase the amount of indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure
or credit ratings. Restrictions on our and our subsidiaries’ ability to Incur additional indebtedness are contained
in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” “—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Non-Guarantor Subsidiary Debt” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sale/Leaseback
Transactions.” Such restrictions can only be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal
amount of the notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the
Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford holders of the notes protection in the
event of a highly leveraged transaction. In addition, holders of the notes may not be entitled to require the
Company to repurchase their notes in certain circumstances involving a significant change in the composition of
the Company’s Board of Directors, including in connection with a proxy contest.

Our ability to repurchase notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of
factors. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control under our Senior Credit Facilities and
cause an event of default under that agreement, may not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event under
the Indenture. Future indebtedness of us and our subsidiaries may contain prohibitions of certain events that
would constitute a Change of Control or require such indebtedness to be repaid or repurchased upon a Change of
Control Triggering Event. Moreover, the exercise by the holders of their right to require us to repurchase the
notes could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the Change of Control Triggering Event itself does
not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on us. Finally, our ability to pay cash to the holders of notes
following the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be limited by our then existing financial
resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required
repurchases.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,”
there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain

46


-----

circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a
disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether
a Change of Control or Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred and whether a holder of notes may
require the Company to make an offer to repurchase the notes as described above.

The provisions under the Indenture relative to our obligation to make an offer to repurchase the notes as a
result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or modified with the written consent of the
holders of a majority in principal amount of the notes.

**Certain Covenants**

The Indenture contains covenants including, among others, the following:

**_Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets_**

The Company will not consolidate with, amalgamate with or merge with or into any other Person or convey,
transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of its properties and assets substantially as an entirety (determined on a
consolidated basis for the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries), in one transaction or a series of related
transactions, directly or indirectly, to any Person, and will not permit any Person to consolidate with, amalgamate
with or merge with or into the Company, unless:

(1) the Company will be the surviving company in any merger, amalgamation or consolidation, or, if the
Company consolidates with, amalgamates with or merges into another Person or conveys or transfers
or leases its properties and assets substantially as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related
transactions, directly or indirectly, to any Person, such successor Person is a corporation organized and
validly existing under the laws of the United States of America or any state thereof or the District of
Columbia, Canada or any province or territory thereof, Luxembourg, the United Kingdom, Ireland,
Germany or France;

(2) the successor Person, if other than the Company, expressly assumes all of the Company’s obligations in
respect of the Indenture and the notes pursuant to a supplemental indenture;

(3) if the successor Person is not the Company, each subsidiary guarantor (unless it is the other party to the
transactions above) shall have by supplemental indenture confirmed that its subsidiary guarantee shall
apply to such successor Person’s obligations in respect of the Indenture and the notes;

(4) immediately after giving effect to the consolidation, amalgamation, merger, conveyance, transfer or
lease, there exists no Default or Event of Default; and

(5) other conditions, including the delivery of an Officers’ Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel,
described in the Indenture are met, including that such consolidation, amalgamation, merger, sale,
conveyance, assignment, transfer, lease or other disposition complies with the requirements of the
Indenture and that the notes and Indenture constitute valid and binding obligations of the successor
Person, as applicable, subject to customary exceptions.

No subsidiary guarantor will consolidate with, amalgamate with or merge with or into any other Person or
convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of its properties and assets substantially as an entirety, in one
transaction or a series of related transactions, directly or indirectly, to any Person, and will not permit any Person
to consolidate with, amalgamate with or merge with or into such subsidiary guarantor, unless:

(1) (a) such subsidiary guarantor is the surviving or acquiring Person and remains organized under the laws
of the United States of America or any state thereof or in the District of Columbia or Canada or any
province or territory thereof or, for any subsidiary guarantor organized outside of such jurisdictions, the
jurisdiction of organization of such subsidiary guarantor; or (b) (i) the successor Person is an entity
organized and validly existing under the laws of the United States of America or any state thereof or

47


-----

the District of Columbia or Canada or any province or territory thereof or, for any subsidiary guarantor
organized outside of such jurisdictions, the jurisdiction of organization of the subsidiary guarantor with
which the successor Person has consolidated, amalgamated or merged, (ii) the successor Person, if
other than the subsidiary guarantor, expressly assumes all of the subsidiary guarantor’s obligations in
respect of the Indenture and the notes pursuant to a supplemental indenture and (iii) immediately after
giving effect to the consolidation, amalgamation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease, there exists no
Default or Event of Default; and

(2) other conditions, including the delivery of an Officers’ Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel,
described in the Indenture are met, including that such consolidation, amalgamation, merger, sale,
conveyance, assignment, transfer, lease or other disposition complies with the requirements of the
Indenture and that the subsidiary guarantee and Indenture constitute valid and binding obligations of
the successor Person, as applicable, subject to customary exceptions;

provided that such restrictions shall not apply to a transaction pursuant to which such subsidiary guarantor
shall be released from its obligations under the Indenture and the notes in accordance with the limitations
described under “—Subsidiary Guarantees”.

This covenant will not apply to any direct or indirect consolidation, amalgamation, merger, conveyance,
transfer, lease or other disposition of properties and assets between or among the Company and the subsidiary
guarantors.

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of the
properties and assets substantially as an entirety of one or more of the Company’s subsidiaries, which properties
and assets, if held by the Company instead of such subsidiaries, would constitute the properties and assets of the
Company substantially as an entirety on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of the properties
and assets of the Company substantially as an entirety.

The predecessor Person will be released from its obligations under the Indenture and the successor Person
will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Company under the
Indenture, but, in the case of a lease of its property or assets substantially as an entirety, the predecessor Person
will not be released from the obligation to pay the principal of and interest on the notes.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

(a) Except as provided in clause (b) below, neither the Company nor any of the subsidiary guarantors may
create, incur, assume or otherwise have outstanding any Lien, upon any Principal Property belonging to the
Company or to any of the subsidiary guarantors, or upon the shares of capital stock or debt of any of the
subsidiary guarantors held directly by the Company or any subsidiary guarantor, whether such Principal
Property, shares or debt are owned by the Company or the subsidiary guarantor on the Issue Date or acquired in
the future, to secure any indebtedness of the Company or any of the subsidiary guarantors.

(b) The Company or any subsidiary guarantor may create, incur, assume or otherwise have outstanding any
Lien to secure indebtedness if the notes (including any additional notes) or the relevant subsidiary guarantee, as
the case may be, will be secured by a Lien equally and ratably with or in priority to the Lien securing the new
indebtedness, so long as such new indebtedness shall be so secured. In this event, the Company and the
subsidiary guarantors may also provide that any of its other indebtedness, including indebtedness guaranteed by
the Company or by any of its subsidiaries, will be secured equally with or in priority to the new indebtedness. In
addition, the restrictions in clause (a) on creating, incurring, assuming or having outstanding any Lien will not
apply to:

(1) Liens securing indebtedness and other obligations of the Company or its subsidiaries under any Credit
Facilities (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Senior Credit Facilities) in an aggregate principal amount at
any one time outstanding not to exceed $2 billion;

consolidated with the Company or such subsidiary or acquired by the Company or such subsidiary (plus
improvements, accessions, proceeds or dividends or distributions in respect thereof);

(5) any Lien required to be given or granted by any subsidiary of the Company pursuant to the terms of any

respect of the property or asset subject to such Lien;

of property or assets secured by such Liens as of the Issue Date and on after-acquired property or assets required
to be secured pursuant to the terms of the relevant indebtedness on the Issue Date), other than Liens securing
indebtedness and other obligations of the Company or its subsidiaries under the Senior Credit Facilities;

(7) extensions, renewals, alterations, refinancings or replacements of any Lien referred to in the preceding

alteration or replacement plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon together with any reasonable fees, premiums
(including tender premiums) and expenses relating to such extension, renewal, alteration or replacement and
(ii) such extension, renewal, alteration, refinancing or replacement shall be limited to all or a part of the property

replaced (plus improvements, accessions or proceeds in respect of such property or assets and after-acquired
property or assets required to be secured pursuant to the terms of such indebtedness);

(8) landlords’, carriers’, warehousemen’s, mechanics’, materialmen’s, repairmen’s or other like Liens
arising in the ordinary course of business securing obligations which are not overdue for a period of more than 60
days or which are being contested in good faith and by appropriate proceedings diligently conducted, if adequate
reserves with respect thereto are maintained on the books of the applicable Person to the extent required under
GAAP;

(9) Liens attaching to cash earnest money deposits in connection with any letter of intent or purchase

excepted by clauses (1) through (24) above; provided that after giving effect thereto, Exempted Debt does not
exceed the greater of (A) $150.0 million and (B) an amount such that, after giving effect to such other liens, the
Secured Net Debt Ratio does not exceed 2.75 to 1.0, after giving effect to such incurrence and the application of
the proceeds therefrom.

In the event that a Lien meets the criteria of more than one of clauses of (1) through (25) above, the
Company, in its sole discretion, will be permitted to classify such Lien (or portion thereof) at the time of its
Incurrence in any manner that complies with this covenant. In addition, any Lien (or portion thereof) originally
classified as Incurred pursuant to any of clauses (1) through (25) above may later be reclassified by the
Company, in its sole discretion, such that it (or any portion thereof) will be deemed to be Incurred pursuant to
any other of such clauses to the extent that such reclassified Lien (or portion thereof) could be Incurred pursuant
to such clause at the time of such reclassification.

(c) For purposes of this covenant:

(1) accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value or original issue discount, the
amortization of debt discount and the payment of interest in the form of additional indebtedness will
not be deemed to be an Incurrence of the indebtedness secured by the relevant Lien;

(2) in determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the securing of
indebtedness, the U.S. dollar-equivalent principal amount of indebtedness denominated in a foreign
currency shall be calculated based upon the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such
indebtedness was Incurred; and

(3) the maximum amount of indebtedness that the Company and its subsidiaries may secure shall not be
deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies.

**_Limitation on Sale/Leaseback Transactions_**

(a) Neither the Company nor any of the subsidiary guarantors may engage in a transaction with any Person
(other than the Company or a subsidiary guarantor) providing for the leasing by the Company or any subsidiary
guarantor of any Principal Property of the Company or a subsidiary guarantor or any property which together
with any other property subject to the same transaction or series of related transactions would in the aggregate
constitute a Principal Property of the Company or a subsidiary guarantor, except for transactions (i) involving a
lease which will not exceed three years, including renewals (or which may be terminated by the Company or the
applicable subsidiary guarantor within a period of not more than three years), (ii) involving a lease of Principal
Property executed by the time of, or within 12 months after, the latest of the acquisition, completion of
construction, or commencement of operations of such Principal Property, (iii) that were for the sale and leasing
back to the Company or a subsidiary any Principal Property, and (iv) that were entered into prior to, or within 12
months of, the Issue Date (a “Sale/Leaseback Transaction”), unless the net proceeds of the sale or transfer of the
property to be leased are at least equal to the fair market value of such property and unless:

(1) the Indenture would have allowed the Company or any of the subsidiary guarantors to create a Lien on
such Principal Property to secure debt in an amount at least equal to the Attributable Debt in respect of
such Sale/Leaseback Transaction without securing the notes pursuant to the terms of the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens”; or

(2) within 360 days, the Company or any subsidiary guarantor applies an amount equal to the net proceeds
of such sale or transfer to:

(A) the voluntary retirement of any indebtedness of the Company or its subsidiaries maturing by its
terms more than one year from the date of issuance, assumption or guarantee thereof, which is
senior to or ranks equally with the notes in right of payment and owing to a Person other than the
Company or any Affiliate of the Company; or

51


-----

(B) the purchase of additional property that will constitute or form a part of Principal Property and
which has a fair market value at least equal to the net proceeds of such sale or transfer.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of the immediately preceding paragraph, the Company or any subsidiary
guarantor may enter into a Sale/Leaseback Transaction which would otherwise be subject to the restrictions of
the immediately preceding paragraph so as to create an aggregate amount of Attributable Debt after giving effect
thereto that does not, together with all Exempted Debt, exceed the greater of (A) $150.0 million and (B) an
amount such that, after giving effect to such other Attributable Debt, the Secured Net Debt Ratio does not exceed
2.75 to 1.0, after giving effect to such incurrence and the application of the proceeds therefrom.

(c) For purposes of this covenant:

(1) in determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the entering into of any
Sale/Leaseback Transaction, the U.S. dollar-equivalent principal amount of Attributable Debt
denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based upon the relevant currency exchange rate
in effect on the date such Attributable Debt in respect of such Sale/Leaseback Transaction was
Incurred; and

(2) the maximum amount of Attributable Debt that the Company or any subsidiary may Incur in respect of
any Sale/Leaseback Transaction shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in
the exchange rate of currencies.

**_Limitation on Non-Guarantor Subsidiary Debt_**

(a) The Company will not cause or permit any subsidiary that is not a subsidiary guarantor: (i) to Guarantee
the obligations of, or become a co-borrower with, the Company or any subsidiary guarantor, under any Credit
Facility of the Company or any subsidiary guarantor or (ii) to create, assume, Incur or issue any Material
Indebtedness, or Guarantee any Material Indebtedness of the Company or another subsidiary guarantor, unless, in
the case of clause (i) or (ii), within 30 days thereof, the Company causes such subsidiary to become a subsidiary
guarantor by executing and delivering a Guarantee Agreement.

(b) Clause (a)(ii) above shall not apply to the following items of indebtedness:

(1) Indebtedness existing as of the Issue Date and refinancing or replacement indebtedness in respect
thereof so long as the principal amount thereof does not exceed the principal amount of the
indebtedness being refinanced or replaced plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon together with any
reasonable fees, premiums (including tender premiums) and expenses relating to such refinancing or
replacement;

(2) Indebtedness of a Person existing at the time such Person is merged with or into, amalgamated with, or
is consolidated into, a subsidiary of the Company, or which is assumed by a subsidiary of the Company
in connection with an acquisition of substantially all the assets of such Person, so long as such
indebtedness was not created in anticipation of such merger, amalgamation, consolidation or
acquisition, and refinancing or replacement indebtedness in respect thereof, so long as the principal
amount thereof does not exceed the principal amount of the indebtedness being refinanced or replaced
plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon together with any reasonable fees, premiums (including tender
premiums) and expenses relating to such refinancing or replacement;

(3) Indebtedness of a Person existing at the time such Person becomes a subsidiary of the Company, so
long as such indebtedness was not Incurred in anticipation of such Person becoming a subsidiary of the
Company, and refinancing or replacement indebtedness in respect thereof, so long as the principal
amount thereof does not exceed the principal amount of the indebtedness being refinanced or replaced
plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon together with any reasonable fees, premiums (including tender
premiums) and expenses relating to such refinancing or replacement;

52


-----

(4) purchase money obligations and refinancing or replacement indebtedness in respect thereof, so long as
the principal amount thereof does not exceed the principal amount of the indebtedness being refinanced
or replaced plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon together with any reasonable fees, premiums
(including tender premiums) and expenses relating to such refinancing or replacement;

(5) Indebtedness of the Company owing to and held by any subsidiary of the Company or indebtedness of
a subsidiary of the Company owing to and held by the Company or any other subsidiary of the
Company;

(6) Indebtedness owed in respect of any overdrafts and related liabilities arising from treasury, depository
and cash management services, pooling arrangements or in connection with any automated
clearinghouse transfers of funds; provided that such indebtedness shall be repaid in full within five
Business Days of the Incurrence thereof;

(7) Indebtedness in respect of letters of credit, bank guarantees and similar instruments issued for the
account of any subsidiary of the Company in the ordinary course of business supporting obligations
under (i) workers’ compensation, unemployment insurance and other social security legislation and
(ii) tenders, bids, trade contracts, leases (other than capitalized lease obligations or synthetic lease
obligations), statutory or regulatory obligations, surety bonds, insurance obligations, performance
bonds and other obligations of a like nature;

(8) Hedging Obligations entered into other than for speculative purposes and the financing of insurance
premiums; and

(9) Indebtedness not excepted by clauses (1) through (8) above in an amount in the aggregate at any time
outstanding not to exceed the greater of (i) $300.0 million and (ii) 30% of Consolidated EBITDA for
the most recently completed Measurement Period on or prior to the date of determination.

In the event that indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of clauses of (1) through (9) above, the
Company, in its sole discretion, will be permitted to classify such indebtedness (or portion thereof) at the time of
its Incurrence in any manner that complies with this covenant. In addition, any indebtedness (or portion thereof)
originally classified as Incurred pursuant to any of clauses (1) through (9) above may later be reclassified by the
Company, in its sole discretion, such that it (or any portion thereof) will be deemed to be Incurred pursuant to
any other of such clauses to the extent that such reclassified indebtedness (or portion thereof) could be Incurred
pursuant to such clause at the time of such reclassification.

Indebtedness Incurred under any of clauses (1) through (9) above by a subsidiary that subsequently becomes
a subsidiary guarantor will cease to be outstanding under such clause at such time as such subsidiary becomes a
subsidiary guarantor until such time, if any, that the Company, in its sole discretion, elects to classify or
reclassify such indebtedness as Incurred under any of such clauses to permit the release of such subsidiary
guarantor’s subsidiary guarantee as permitted under “—Subsidiary Guarantees.”

(c) For purposes of this covenant:

(1) accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value or original issue discount, the
amortization of debt discount and the payment of interest in the form of additional indebtedness will
not be deemed to be an Incurrence of indebtedness;

(2) in determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
indebtedness, the U.S. dollar-equivalent principal amount of indebtedness denominated in a foreign
currency shall be calculated based upon the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such
indebtedness was Incurred; provided, however, that if such indebtedness is Incurred to refinance or
replace other indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing or replacement
would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the
relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing or replacement, such U.S.

53


-----

dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal
amount of such refinancing or replacement indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such
indebtedness being refinanced or replaced; and

(3) the maximum amount of indebtedness that the Company and its subsidiaries may Incur shall not be
deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies.

**_Reports_**

Whether or not the Company is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange
Act, the Company will provide the Trustees and the holders of the notes with:

(1) within 90 days after the end of each fiscal year, all financial information that would be required to be
contained in an annual report on Form 10-K, Form 40-F or Form 20-F, or any successor or comparable form,
filed with the SEC, including a “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” section and a report on the annual financial statements by the Company’s independent registered
public accounting firm;

(2) within 45 days after the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters of each fiscal year, all financial
information that would be required to be contained in a quarterly report on Form 10-Q or Form 6-K, or any
successor or comparable form, filed with the SEC, including, whether or not required, unaudited quarterly
financial statements (which will include at least a balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement) and a
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section; and

(3) within the later of 5 days and the applicable number of days specified in the SEC’s rules and regulations,
all current reports that would be required to be filed with the SEC on Form 8-K, or any successor or comparable
form, if the Company were required to file such reports, in each case in a manner that complies in all material
respects with the requirements specified in such form.

In addition, to the extent not satisfied by the foregoing, for so long as any notes are outstanding, the
Company will furnish to holders, securities analysts and prospective purchasers of the notes, upon their request,
the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act. The reports
required by this covenant need not include any separate financial statements of subsidiary guarantors or
information required by Rule 3-10 or 3-16 of Regulation S-X (or any successor regulations). The delivery to the
Trustees and the holders by electronic means or the filing of documents pursuant to the SEC’s EDGAR system
(or any successor electronic filing system) shall be deemed to be provided to the Trustees and the holders as of
the time such documents are filed via the EDGAR system for purposes of this covenant. The requirements set
forth in this paragraph, the preceding paragraph and the succeeding paragraph may be satisfied by posting copies
of such information on a website (which may be nonpublic and may be maintained by the Company or a third
party), to which access is given to the Trustees, holders and prospective purchasers of the notes. The Trustees
shall have no responsibility whatsoever to determine if such filings have been made. The Trustees shall not be
deemed to have constructive notice of any information contained, or determinable from information contained, in
any reports referred to above, including the Company’s compliance with any of its covenants in the Indenture (as
to which the Trustees are entitled to rely exclusively on Officers’ Certificates). Neither of the Trustees shall be
obligated to monitor or confirm, on a continuing basis or otherwise, the Company’s, any subsidiary guarantor’s
or any other Person’s compliance with the covenants described herein or with respect to any reports or other
documents filed under the Indenture.

If any of the Company’s subsidiaries is not a subsidiary guarantor and such subsidiaries, either individually
or collectively, would constitute 10% of the Consolidated EBITDA of the Company and its subsidiaries for any
fiscal year or 10% of the total assets of the Company and its subsidiaries (as set forth on the most recent
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its subsidiaries), within the time period specified above for

54

annual reports, the Company will provide to the Trustees and the holders of the notes, financial information with
respect to such subsidiaries that are not subsidiary guarantors collectively consistent with the financial
information included in the Offering Memorandum with respect to subsidiaries that are not subsidiary guarantors.

In the event that any direct or indirect parent company of the Company becomes a guarantor of the notes,
the Company may satisfy its obligations under this covenant to provide consolidated financial information of the
Company by furnishing consolidated financial information relating to such parent in the manner prescribed in the
first and second paragraphs of this covenant; provided that (1) such financial statements are accompanied by
consolidating financial information for such parent and the Company in the manner prescribed by the SEC or
(2) such parent is not engaged in any business in any material respect other than such activities as are incidental
to its ownership, directly or indirectly, of the Capital Stock of the Company.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be deemed to have failed to comply
with its obligations under this covenant until 60 days after the date any report or other information is due
hereunder.

**_Events of Default_**

Under the terms of the Indenture, each of the following will constitute an Event of Default with respect to
the notes:

(1) default for 30 days in the payment of any interest on the notes when due;

(2) default in the payment of principal or premium, if any, on the notes when due at its stated maturity, upon
optional redemption, upon required purchase, upon declaration of acceleration or otherwise;

(3) the failure by the Company to comply with any of its obligations in the covenant described above under
“—Change of Control Triggering Event”;

(4) the Company or any subsidiary guarantor defaults in the performance of or breaches any other covenant
or agreement of the Company or such subsidiary guarantor, as applicable, in the Indenture (other than a failure to
comply with clause (3) above) with respect to the notes or any guarantee relating thereto, as applicable, and such
default or breach continues for a period of 60 days after written notice is given to the Company by the Trustees or
to the Company and the Trustees by the holders of 25% or more in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
notes specifying such default or breach and requiring it to be remedied and stating that such notice is a “Notice of
Default” as defined in the Indenture;

(5) the subsidiary guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect except as
otherwise permitted under the Indenture or is declared null and void in a judicial proceeding or is disaffirmed by
any subsidiary guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary;

(6) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization;

(7) default under any Lien, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may
be secured or evidenced any indebtedness of the Company or any of its subsidiaries other than indebtedness
owed to the Company or a subsidiary, whether such indebtedness now exists, or is created after the Issue Date,
which default (A) is caused by a failure to pay principal of, or premium, if any, on such indebtedness (“principal
payment default”) or (B) results in the acceleration of such indebtedness prior to its maturity (“cross acceleration
provision”) without such indebtedness having been discharged or the acceleration having been cured, waived,
rescinded or annulled, for a period of, in the case of clause (A) or (B) above, 30 days or more after written notice
thereof to the Company by the Trustees or to the Company and the Trustees by the holders of at least 25% in
aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes and, in each case, the principal amount of any such

55


-----

indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such indebtedness under which there has been a
principal payment default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates $150.0 million (or its
equivalent in other currencies) or more; and

(8) the taking or entering against the Company or any of its subsidiaries of a judgment or decree for the
payment of money in excess of $150.0 million (or its equivalent in other currencies) in the aggregate and such
judgment or decree is not paid, vacated or discharged within a period of 90 days after such judgment or degree
becomes final and non-appealable.

The Company will be required to furnish the Trustees annually an Officers’ Certificate as to the fulfillment
of its obligations under the Indenture. In addition, the Company is required to deliver to the Trustees, within 30
days after it obtains knowledge of the occurrence thereof, written notice of any event which would constitute
certain Defaults, their status and what action it is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

If a Default occurs and is continuing and is actually known to a responsible officer of a Trustee, that Trustee
shall send to the other Trustee and to each holder of notes a notice of the Default within 90 days after it occurs.
The Indenture will provide that a Trustee may withhold notice to holders of the notes of any Default, except in
respect of the payment of principal or interest on the notes (for which it does not have to provide notice), if it
considers it in the interests of the holders of the notes to do so. Except for an Event of Default described under
(1) or (2) above, the Trustees shall not be deemed to have notice or be charged with knowledge of any Default or
Event of Default unless the U.S. Trustee has received written notice thereof from the Company or the holders of
not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding.

**_Effect of an Event of Default_**

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (6) above under the heading
“Events of Default”), occurs and is continuing the U.S. Trustee (by written notice to the Company) or the holders
of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes (by written notice to the Company
and the U.S. Trustee) may, and the U.S. Trustee at the written request of such holders shall, declare the principal
amount of and premium, if any, and accrued but unpaid interest and any other monetary obligations on the notes
to be due and payable immediately. Upon that declaration, the principal amount, premium, if any, and interest
will become immediately due and payable. However, at any time after a declaration of acceleration has been
made, but before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained, the holders of not less
than a majority in aggregate principal amount may, subject to conditions specified in the Indenture, rescind and
annul that declaration and its consequences.

If an Event of Default in the case of certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization exists, the
principal amount of and premium, if any, accrued but unpaid interest and any other monetary obligations on all
of the outstanding notes will automatically, and without any declaration or other action on the part of the
Trustees or any holder of such outstanding notes, become immediately due and payable.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the U.S. Trustee, if an Event of Default
then exists, the U.S. Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the
Indenture (other than the payment of any amounts on the notes furnished to it pursuant to the Indenture) at any
holder’s (or any other person’s) request, order or direction, unless such holder has (or such other person has)
offered to the U.S. Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to the U.S. Trustee against any loss, liability or
expense. Subject to the provisions for the security or indemnification of the U.S. Trustee, the holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of outstanding notes will have the right to direct the time, method and
place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the U.S. Trustee, or exercising any trust or power
conferred on the U.S. Trustee in connection with the notes.

56


-----

**_Legal Proceedings and Enforcement of Right to Payment_**

Unless a holder has previously given to the Trustees written notice of a continuing Event of Default with
respect to the notes, no holder will have any right to institute any proceeding for the notes in connection with the
Indenture or for any remedy under the Indenture. In addition, the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding notes must have made a written request, and offered security or indemnity satisfactory
to each of the Trustees against any loss, liability or expense to institute that proceeding as Trustees, and, within
90 days following the receipt of such notice, the U.S. Trustee must not have received from the holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes a direction inconsistent with that request, and the
U.S. Trustee must have failed to institute a proceeding within such 90 day period. However, holders will have an
absolute and unconditional right to receive payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the notes
on or after the due dates expressed in the notes (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the redemption date)
and to institute a suit for the enforcement of that payment.

**_Modification of the Indenture_**

The Company, the subsidiary guarantors and the Trustees may, without the consent of any holders of the
notes, enter into supplemental indentures that amend, waive or supplement the terms of the Indenture, the notes
and the subsidiary guarantees for specified purposes. The purposes for which the Indenture, the notes and the
subsidiary guarantees thereof can be amended without the consent of any holders will include the following:

   - to evidence the succession of another Person to the Company or any subsidiary guarantor under the
Indenture, the notes, and the subsidiary guarantees;

   - to add guarantees with respect to the notes or release a subsidiary guarantor from its obligations under
its subsidiary guarantee or the Indenture as permitted by the Indenture;

   - to convey, transfer, assign, mortgage or pledge any property to the Trustees for the benefit of the holders
of the notes;

   - to surrender any right or power the Indenture may confer on the Company;

   - to add to the covenants made in the Indenture for the benefit of the holders of all notes (as determined in
good faith by the Company);

   - to make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any holder of notes in any material
respect (as determined in good faith by the Company);

   - to add any additional Events of Default;

   - to secure the notes or any subsidiary guarantee;

   - to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment by additional or successor Trustees with
respect to the notes;

   - to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency in the Indenture;

   - to conform the text of the Indenture, the notes or the subsidiary guarantees to any provision of this
“Description of Notes” to the extent that such provision in this “Description of Notes” was intended to
be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the notes or the subsidiary guarantees (as
determined in good faith by the Company);

   - to provide for the issuance of additional notes in accordance with the limitations set forth in the
Indenture as of the Issue Date;

   - if permitted by applicable law, to combine the responsibilities and obligations of the U.S. Trustee and
the Canadian Trustee into a single trustee for all purposes of the Indenture and the notes or to remove
the Canadian Trustee, subject to the assumption of the Canadian Trustee’s obligations under the
Indenture by the U.S. Trustee;

57


-----

   - to make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer, legending and
delegending of notes as permitted by the Indenture, including, without limitation, to facilitate the
issuance, administration and book-entry transfer of the notes; provided, however, that (i) compliance
with the Indenture as so amended would not result in the notes being transferred in violation of the
Securities Act or any applicable securities law, including Canadian Securities Laws, and (ii) such
amendment does not materially and adversely affect the rights of holders to transfer the notes (except as
may be required to comply with securities laws); and

   - to supplement any provisions of the Indenture necessary to defease and discharge the notes or the
Indenture (in accordance with the defeasance or discharge provisions, of the Indenture); provided that
such action does not adversely affect the interests of the holders of any notes in any material respect (as
determined in good faith by the Company).

The Company, the subsidiary guarantors and the Trustees may modify and amend any of the Indenture, the
notes and the subsidiary guarantees thereof with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding notes (including, without limitation, consents obtained in
connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such notes). However, no modification or
amendment may, without the consent of the holder of each outstanding note affected thereby:

   - change the stated maturity of the principal of, or any installment of interest payable on, the outstanding
notes;

   - reduce the principal amount of, or the rate of interest on, any outstanding notes or the premium, if any,
payable upon the redemption thereof, that would be due and payable upon redemption of such note
(other than the provisions relating to the covenants described under “—Change of Control Triggering
Event”) or would be provable in bankruptcy, or adversely affect any right of repayment of the holder of
the outstanding notes;

   - reduce the amount of principal of notes payable upon acceleration of the maturity thereof;

   - change the place of payment or the coin or currency in which the principal of or premium, if any, or the
interest on the outstanding notes is payable;

   - impair any holder’s right to receive payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the
outstanding notes on or after the due dates therefor or any holder’s right to institute suit for the
enforcement of any payment on or with respect to the outstanding notes;

   - modify the subsidiary guarantees in any manner adverse to the holders of the notes (but, for the
avoidance of doubt, not including modifications necessary to give effect to any of the provisions set
forth in the last paragraph under “—Subsidiary Guarantees” or under the heading “—Limitation on
Non-Guarantor Subsidiary Debt”);

   - reduce the percentage of the holders of the outstanding notes necessary to modify or amend the
Indenture, to waive compliance with any provision of the Indenture or certain defaults and consequences
of the defaults or to reduce the quorum or voting requirements set forth in the Indenture; or

   - modify any of these provisions or any of the provisions relating to the waiver of certain past defaults or
provisions of the Indenture, except to increase the required percentage to effect such action or to provide
that certain other provisions may not be modified or waived without the consent of all of the holders of
notes.

Subject to the two preceding paragraphs, the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding notes may, on behalf of the holders of all the notes, waive (including, without
limitation, by consent obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such
notes) compliance by the Company with any provision of the Indenture. The holders of not less than a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes may, on behalf of the holders of all the notes, waive

58


-----

(including, without limitation, by consent obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange
offer for, such notes) past defaults by the Company under certain covenants of the Indenture which relate to the
notes. However, a default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on, any of the notes or
relating to a provision which under the Indenture cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the
holder of each outstanding note affected may not be so waived.

**Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

The Indenture will provide that the Company may discharge all of its obligations, other than as to transfers
and exchanges and certain other specified obligations, under the notes at any time (“defeasance”). The Indenture
will also provide that the Company may be released from its obligations described above under “—Certain
Covenants— Limitation on Liens,” “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sale/Lease Back Transactions,”
“—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Non-Guarantor Subsidiary Debt” and “—Certain Covenants—Reports,”
and certain aspects of its obligations described above under “—Certain Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and
Sale of Assets,” and from certain other obligations, and elect not to comply with those sections and obligations
without creating an Event of Default, and that the Company may terminate the operation of the cross-default
upon a principal payment default, cross acceleration provisions and the subsidiary guarantors provision in
“—Events of Default” (“covenant defeasance”). If the Company exercises its defeasance or covenant defeasance
option, the subsidiary guarantees in effect at such time will terminate.

Defeasance and covenant defeasance may be effected with respect to the notes only if, among other things:

   - the Company irrevocably deposits with the U.S. Trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations or a
combination thereof, as trust funds in an amount certified to be sufficient in the opinion of a nationally
recognized firm of independent public accountants, a nationally recognized investment bank or a
nationally recognized appraisal or valuation firm delivered to the U.S. Trustee to pay on each date that
they become due and payable, the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on all outstanding notes;

   - the Company delivers to the Trustees an Opinion of Counsel in the United States to the effect that:

     - the beneficial owners of the notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for United States federal
income tax purposes as a result of the defeasance or covenant defeasance; and

     - the defeasance or covenant defeasance will not otherwise alter those beneficial owners’ United
States federal income tax treatment of principal and interest payments on the notes;

   - the Company delivers to the Trustees an Opinion of Counsel in Canada to the effect that:

     - the beneficial owners of the notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for Canadian federal
income tax purposes as a result of the defeasance or covenant defeasance; and

     - the defeasance or covenant defeasance will not otherwise alter those beneficial owners’ Canadian
federal income tax treatment of principal and interest payments on the notes;

(in the case of defeasance, this opinion must be based on a ruling of the Internal Revenue Service or a
change in United States federal income tax law occurring after the Issue Date);

   - no Default or Event of Default under the Indenture has occurred and is continuing after giving effect to
such defeasance or covenant defeasance (other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the
borrowing of funds to be applied to such deposit and any simultaneous deposit relating to other
indebtedness and, in each case, the granting of Liens in connection therewith);

   - the Company is not an “insolvent person” within the meaning of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act
(Canada) and is not insolvent, unable to pay its debts in full or on the eve of insolvency under applicable
provincial law on the date of such deposit;

   - such defeasance or covenant defeasance does not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a
default under, any indenture or other agreement or instrument for borrowed money to which the

59


-----

Company is a party or by which the Company is bound (other than a default or event of default resulting
from the borrowing of funds to be applied to such deposit and any simultaneous deposit relating to other
indebtedness and, in each case, the granting of Liens in connection therewith);

   - the Company delivers to the Trustees an Officers’ Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating
that all conditions precedent with respect to such defeasance or covenant defeasance have been
complied with; and

   - other conditions specified in the Indenture have been met.

In connection with any defeasance or covenant defeasance involving a redemption that requires the payment
of the Applicable Premium, the amount deposited with the U.S. Trustee as provided in the first bullet point of the
immediately preceding paragraph in respect of such Applicable Premium shall be sufficient if equal to the
Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of deposit, with any deficit as of the date of redemption (any such
amount, the “Applicable Premium Deficit”) only required to be deposited with the U.S. Trustee on or prior to the
date of redemption. Any Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the
Trustee simultaneously with the deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms that such Applicable
Premium Deficit shall be applied toward such redemption.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will provide that when, among other things, all the notes not previously delivered to the U.S.
Trustee for cancellation: have become due and payable; will become due and payable at their stated maturity
within one year; or are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the U.S.
Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the U.S. Trustee in the Company’s name and at the Company’s
expense, and the Company or a subsidiary guarantor deposits or causes to be deposited with the U.S. Trustee, in
trust, an amount of money or U.S. Government Obligations, or a combination thereof (such amount to be
certified in the case of U.S. Government Obligations) sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on
notes not previously delivered to the U.S. Trustee for cancellation, for the principal and premium, if any, and
interest to the date of the deposit or to the stated maturity or redemption, as the case may be, then the Indenture
and all of the Company’s obligations in respect of the notes will cease to be of further effect, and the Company
will be deemed to have satisfied and discharged the Indenture and all of its obligations in respect of the notes.
However, the Company will continue to be obligated to pay all other sums due under the Indenture to the
Trustees and to provide the Officers’ Certificates and Opinions of Counsel described in the Indenture.

In connection with any satisfaction and discharge involving a redemption that requires the payment of the
Applicable Premium, the amount deposited with the U.S. Trustee as provided above in respect of such
Applicable Premium shall be sufficient if equal to the Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of deposit,
with any Applicable Premium Deficit only required to be deposited with the U.S. Trustee on or prior to the date
of redemption. Any Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the U.S.
Trustee simultaneously with the deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms that such Applicable
Premium Deficit shall be applied toward such redemption.

**Payment and Paying Agents**

The Company will pay principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the notes at the office of the U.S.
Trustee or at the office of any paying agent that the Company may designate. The Company may at any time
designate additional paying agents or rescind the designation of any paying agent. The Company must maintain a
paying agent in each place of payment for the notes. Initially, the U.S. Trustee shall serve as paying agent.

The Company will pay any interest on the notes to the registered owner of the notes at the close of business
on the regular record date for the interest, except in the case of defaulted interest.

60


-----

Any moneys deposited with the U.S. Trustee or any paying agent, or then held by the Company in trust, for
the payment of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on any notes that remain unclaimed for two
years after the principal, premium or interest has become due and payable will, at the Company’s request, be
repaid to the Company. After repayment to the Company, holders of the notes are entitled to seek payment only
from the Company as a general unsecured creditor.

**Governing Law**

The notes and the Indenture will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of
New York. The Indenture provides that we, the Trustees, and each holder of a note by its acceptance thereof,
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal
proceeding arising out of or relating to the Indenture, the notes or any transaction contemplated thereby.

**Information Concerning the Trustees**

Except during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustees will perform only such duties as are
specifically set forth in the Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default, the Trustees will each exercise
such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of care and skill in its
exercise as a prudent person would exercise under the circumstances in the conduct of such person’s own affairs.
The holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding notes will have the right to direct the time,
method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the U.S. Trustee, subject
to certain exceptions. Subject to these provisions, the U.S. Trustee will not be under obligation to exercise any of
its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any holder of notes, unless such holder has offered to the
U.S. Trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense.

The Bank of New York Mellon will be the U.S. Trustee under the Indenture. The U.S. Trustee’s current
address is for note transfer purposes and presentment of the notes for final payment thereon, and for all other
purposes, 240 Greenwich Street, New York, New York 10286. BNY Trust Company of Canada will be the
Canadian Trustee under the Indenture. The Canadian Trustee’s current address is 320 Bay Street, 11th Floor,

also the U.S. Trustee and Canadian Trustee, respectively, under the 2023 Notes Indenture and the 2026 Notes
Indenture. The Bank of New York Mellon and BNY Trust Company of Canada will also be the U.S. Trustee and
the Canadian Trustee, respectively, under the indenture governing the Other Notes.

**Book-Entry, Delivery and Form**

**_General_**

The notes will initially be issued in the form of one or more registered notes in global form without interest
coupons. Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the
Securities Act will initially be represented by global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached

69


-----

(the “144A Global Notes”). Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities
Act will initially be represented by global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the
“Regulation S Global Notes” and, collectively with the 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). Each of the
Global Notes will, upon issuance, be deposited with a custodian for DTC and registered in the name of Cede &
Co., as nominee for DTC.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to participants in DTC
or persons that may hold interests through such participants in DTC.

We expect that under procedures established by DTC:

   - upon deposit of each Global Note with DTC’s custodian, DTC will credit portions of the principal
amount of the Global Note to the accounts of the DTC participants designated by the initial purchasers;
and

   - ownership of Book-Entry Interests in each Global Note will be shown on, and transfer of ownership of
those interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to interests of
DTC participants) and the records of DTC participants (with respect to other owners of Book-Entry
Interests in the Global Notes).

Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes will initially be credited within DTC to Euroclear
Bank S.A./N.V. (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking, société anonyme (“Clearstream”), on behalf of the
owners of
these interests.

Investors may hold their interests in the Regulation S Global Notes directly through Euroclear or
Clearstream, if they are participants in those systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants in
those systems. Investors may also hold their interests in the Regulation S Global Notes through organizations
other than Euroclear or Clearstream that are DTC participants. Each of Euroclear and Clearstream will appoint a
DTC participant to act as its depositary for the interests in the Regulation S Global Notes that are held within
DTC for the account of each settlement system on behalf of its participants.

**_Transfers_**

Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on
transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer Restrictions”
elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in
DTC will be effected by DTC pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and
procedures established by DTC and its participants (including Euroclear and Clearstream).

Each Rule 144A Global Note and Regulation S Global Note (and any note issued in exchange therefor) will
be subject to certain restrictions on transfer set forth therein and in the Indenture and will bear the legend
regarding such restrictions substantially as set forth under “Transfer Restrictions” elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum.

Prior to the end of the period ending on the fortieth (40th) day after the later of (x) the commencement of
the offering of the notes and (y) the date of closing of such offering (the “Restricted Period”), any resale or other
transfer of a Book-Entry Interest in a Regulation S Global Note to a U.S. Person (as defined in Regulation S
under the Securities Act) will not be permitted unless such resale or transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A or
Regulation S and in accordance with the certification requirements described in the following sentence. Prior to
the end of the Restricted Period, a Book-Entry Interest in a Regulation S Global Note may be transferred in the
United States only to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in a Rule 144A Global
Note and only upon receipt by us, the U.S. Trustee and the principal Registrar of a written certification from the

70


-----

transferor (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person that the
transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” as such term is defined in Rule 144A in a
transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A and in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any
state of the United States or any other jurisdiction. After the expiration of the relevant Restricted Period, such
certification requirement will no longer apply to such transfers.

A Book-Entry Interest in a Rule 144A Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of a Book-Entry Interest in a Regulation S Global Note only upon receipt by us, the U.S. Trustee and the
principal Registrar of a written certification from the transferor (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the
effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Rule 903 or Rule 904 of Regulation S or Rule 144
under the Securities Act and that, if such transfer occurs prior to the expiration of the Restricted Period, the
interest transferred will be held immediately thereafter through DTC.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon
transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a
Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it
will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If definitive registered notes are issued in exchange for Global Notes (“Definitive Registered Notes”), they
will be issued only in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof, upon
receipt by the applicable Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other
documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions
received by DTC from the participant who owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes
issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined
by us to be in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the
restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer Restrictions” elsewhere in
this Offering Memorandum.

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be
transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of $2,000 in principal amount and
integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof at the office of any Registrar for such notes. In connection with any
such transfer or exchange, the Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging Holder of a note to, among
other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the
account of the transferee at DTC, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any taxes, duties and
governmental charges in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made
without charge to the holder, other than any taxes, duties and governmental charges payable in connection with
such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, we are not required to register the transfer or exchange of any notes:

(a) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of such notes;

(b) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of such notes to be redeemed in
part;

(c) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date applicable to
such notes; or

(d) which the holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of
Control Offer.

Except as described herein, we and the Trustees will be entitled to treat the holder of a note as the owner of
it for all purposes.

**_Book-Entry Procedures for the Global Notes_**

All Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the operations and procedures of DTC,
Euroclear and Clearstream. We are providing the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely
for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that
settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of us, the subsidiary guarantors, the Trustees, the
Paying Agent, the Registrar, any transfer agent or the initial purchasers are responsible for those operations or
procedures.

We have been advised by DTC that it is:

   - a limited purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York;

   - a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York State Banking Law;

   - a member of the Federal Reserve System;

   - a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code; and

   - a “clearing agency” registered under Section 17A of the Exchange Act.

DTC was created to hold securities for its participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of
securities transactions between its participants through electronic book-entry changes to the accounts of its
participants. DTC’s participants include securities brokers and dealers, including the initial purchasers, banks and
trust companies, clearing corporations and other organizations. Indirect access to DTC’s system is also available
to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies; these indirect participants clear through or
maintain a custodial relationship with a DTC participant, either directly or indirectly. Investors who are not DTC
participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through DTC participants or
indirect participants in DTC.

So long as DTC’s nominee is the registered owner of the Global Notes, that nominee will be considered the
sole owner or holder of the notes represented by the Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. Except as
provided below, owners of Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes:

   - will not be entitled to have notes represented by the Global Notes registered in their names;

   - will not receive or be entitled to receive Definitive Registered Notes; and

   - will not be considered the owners or holders of the notes under the Indenture for any purpose, including
with respect to the giving of any direction, instruction or approval to the Trustees under the Indenture.

As a result, each investor who owns Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes must rely on the procedures of
DTC to exercise any rights of a holder of notes under the Indenture (and, if the investor is not a participant or an
indirect participant in DTC, on the procedures of the DTC participant through which the investor owns its
interest).

Payments of principal, premium (if any), interest and Additional Amounts (if any) with respect to notes
represented by Global Notes will be made by the U.S. Trustee to DTC’s nominee as the registered holder of the
Global Notes. Neither we, the subsidiary guarantors, the Trustees, the Paying Agent, the Registrar nor any
transfer agent will have any responsibility or liability for the payment of amounts to owners of Book-Entry
Interests in the Global Notes, for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of those
interests by DTC, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records of DTC relating to those interests.

Payments by participants and indirect participants in DTC to the owners of Book-Entry Interests in the
Global Notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary industry practice and will be the
responsibility of those participants or indirect participants and DTC.

Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected under DTC’s procedures and will be settled in
same-day funds. Transfers between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way
under the rules and operating procedures of those systems.

Cross-market transfers between DTC participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream
participants, on the other hand, will be effected within DTC through the DTC participants that are acting as
depositaries for Euroclear and Clearstream. To deliver or receive Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes held
in a Euroclear or Clearstream account, an investor must send transfer instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as
the case may be, under the rules and procedures of that system and within the established deadlines of that
system. If the transaction meets its settlement requirements, Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will
send instructions to its DTC depositary to take action to effect final settlement by delivering or receiving interests
in the relevant Global Notes in DTC, and making or receiving payment under normal procedures for same-day
funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly
to the DTC depositaries that are acting for Euroclear or Clearstream.

Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant that
purchases Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes from a DTC participant will be credited on the business day
for Euroclear or Clearstream immediately following the DTC settlement date. Cash received in Euroclear or
Clearstream from the sale of Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes to a DTC participant will be received with
value on the DTC settlement date but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account as
of the business day for Euroclear or Clearstream following the DTC settlement date.

DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the above procedures to facilitate transfers of Book-Entry
Interests in the Global Notes among participants in those settlement systems. However, the settlement systems
are not obligated to perform these procedures and may discontinue or change these procedures at any time.

None of us, the subsidiary guarantors, the Trustees, the Paying Agent, the Registrar or any transfer agent
will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their participants or
indirect participants of their obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**_Redemption of Global Notes_**

In the event any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, DTC or its nominee will redeem an equal
amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the
redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such BookEntry Interests will be equal to the amount received by DTC in connection with the redemption of such Global
Note (or any portion thereof). We understand that, under existing practices of DTC, if fewer than all of the notes
are to be redeemed at any time, DTC will credit its participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with
adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or on such other basis as DTC deems fair and appropriate; provided,
however, that no Book-Entry Interest of $2,000 principal amount or less may be redeemed in part.

**_Currency of Payment for the Global Notes_**

Except as may otherwise be agreed between DTC and any holder, the principal of, premium, if any, and
interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global Notes will be paid to holders of interests in
such notes through DTC in U.S. dollars.

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any regulations of
the applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. None of us, the subsidiary guarantors, the Trustees, the Paying
Agent, the Registrar, any transfer agent, the initial purchasers or any of their respective agents will be liable to
any Holder of a Global Note or any other person for any commissions, costs, losses or expenses in relation to or
resulting from any currency conversion or rounding effected in connection with any such payment.

73


-----

**_Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests_**

DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of notes (including the
presentation of notes for exchange as described below) only at the direction of one or more participants to whose
account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the
aggregate principal amount of notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction.
DTC will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in
respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an Event of Default under the notes, DTC reserves the right to
exchange the Global Notes for Definitive Registered Notes, and to distribute Definitive Registered Notes to its
participants.

**_Definitive Registered Notes_**

Definitive Registered Notes will be issued and delivered to each person that DTC identifies as a beneficial
owner of the related notes only if:

   - we are notified by DTC at any time that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the Global
Notes and a successor depositary is not appointed within 90 days;

   - DTC ceases to be registered as a clearing agency under the Exchange Act and a successor depositary is
not appointed within 90 days;

   - we, at our option, notify the Trustees that we elect to cause the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes;
or

   - certain other events provided in the Indenture should occur.

**CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a general discussion of certain United States federal income tax consequences of the
purchase, ownership and disposition of the notes by a person who acquires the notes in this offering at a price
equal to the issue price shown on the front cover of this offering memorandum. Except where noted, the
following discussion addresses only notes held as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and does not deal with special situations, such as those
of broker-dealers, tax-exempt organizations, individual retirement accounts and other tax deferred accounts,
controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, holders that own 10% or more of the
Company’s outstanding stock (by vote or value), financial institutions, insurance companies, traders in securities
electing to mark to market, certain short-term holders of notes, partnerships or other pass-through entities (or
investors in such entities), persons hedging their exposure in the notes or holding notes as part of a hedging or
conversion transaction, a straddle or a constructive sale, U.S. expatriates, nonresident alien individuals present in
the United States for more than 182 days in a taxable year, or U.S. Holders (as defined below) whose functional
currency is not the U.S. dollar. Holders should be aware that the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
purchase, ownership and disposition of the notes may be materially different for investors described in the prior
sentence. In addition, the following does not consider the effect of any applicable foreign, state, local or other
U.S. federal tax laws (such as estate or gift tax, the alternative minimum tax, or the Medicare tax on investment
income).

The following discussion is based upon the provisions of the Code and regulations, rulings and judicial
decisions thereunder as of the date hereof, and such authorities may be repealed, revoked, interpreted or modified
(possibly with retroactive effect) so as to result in U.S. federal income tax consequences different from those
discussed below.

As used herein, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of a note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
a citizen or individual resident of the United States or a domestic corporation or that otherwise is subject to
United States federal income taxation on a net income basis in respect of the note.

If any entity taxable as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds notes, the U.S. federal
income tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the
activities of the partnership. If you are a partner of such a partnership holding the notes, you should consult your
own tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the notes.

_Persons considering the purchase, ownership or disposition of notes should consult their own tax advisors_
_concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences of such purchase, ownership or disposition as well as any_
_consequences arising under the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction._

**U.S. Holders**

**_Book/Tax Conformity._**

U.S. Holders that use an accrual method of accounting for tax purposes (“accrual method holders”)
generally are required to include certain amounts in income no later than the time such amounts are reflected on
certain financial statements (the “book/tax conformity rule”). The application of the book/tax conformity rule
thus may require the accrual of income earlier than would be the case under the general tax rules described
below. It is not entirely clear to what types of income the book/tax conformity rule applies, or, in some cases,
how the rule is to be applied if it is applicable. However, recently released proposed regulations generally would
exclude, among other items, original issue discount and market discount (in either case, whether or not de
_minimis) from the applicability of the book/tax conformity rule. Although the proposed regulations generally will_
not be effective until taxable years beginning after the date on which they are issued in final form, taxpayers
generally are permitted to elect to rely on their provisions currently. Accrual method holders should consult with
their tax advisors regarding the potential applicability of the book/tax conformity rule to their particular situation.

75


-----

**_Payment of Interest_**

The amount of stated interest payments on a note will generally be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary
income at the time it is paid or accrued, in accordance with such U.S. Holder’s method of accounting for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. It is expected, and this discussion assumes, that the notes will be issued without
original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In the event the notes are issued with more
than de minimis OID, U.S. Holders will be required to include OID in income on a constant-yield basis over the
life of the notes.

Interest income in respect of the notes generally will constitute foreign-source income for purposes of
computing the foreign tax credit allowable under the U.S. federal income tax laws. The rules governing the
foreign tax credit are complex. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the availability of
foreign tax credits or deductions in respect of foreign taxes and the treatment of Additional Amounts (if any).

**_Sale, Exchange, Redemption, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of the Notes_**

A U.S. Holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or
other taxable disposition of a note in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of cash plus the fair
market value of any property received (other than any such amount attributable to accrued interest, which will be
taxable as ordinary income to the extent not previously included in income), and the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in
the note. A U.S. Holder’s tax basis in a note will, in general, be the U.S. Holder’s purchase price for the note.

Any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable
disposition of a note that such U.S. Holder has held for more than one year generally will be long-term capital
gain or loss. For non-corporate holders, certain preferential tax rates may apply to gain recognized as long-term
capital gain. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to certain limitations. Any gain or loss realized by a
U.S. Holder on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other disposition of a note generally will be treated
as U.S. source gain or loss, as the case may be.

**_Foreign Financial Asset Reporting_**

Certain U.S. Holders that own “specified foreign financial assets” with an aggregate value in excess of
$50,000 on the last day of the taxable year or $75,000 at any time during the taxable year are generally required
to file an information statement along with their tax returns, currently on Form 8938, with respect to such assets.
“Specified foreign financial assets” include any financial accounts held at a non-U.S. financial institution, as well
as securities issued by a non-U.S. issuer that are not held in accounts maintained by financial institutions. The
understatement of income attributable to “specified foreign financial assets” in excess of $5,000 extends the
statute of limitations with respect to the tax return to six years after the return was filed. U.S. Holders who fail to
report the required information could be subject to substantial penalties. Prospective investors are encouraged to
consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible application of these rules, including the application of
the rules to their particular circumstances.

**Information Reporting and Backup Withholding**

Payments in respect of the notes that are paid within the United States or through certain U.S.-related
financial intermediaries are subject to information reporting and may be subject to backup withholding unless the
U.S. taxpayer (i) is an exempt recipient and demonstrates this fact, or (ii) provides a correct taxpayer
identification number and complies with certain certification procedures. Holders of notes that are not U.S.
taxpayers may be required to comply with applicable certification procedures to establish that they are not U.S.
taxpayers in order to avoid the application of such information reporting requirements and backup withholding.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a U.S. or
non-U.S. taxpayer will be allowed as a credit against the holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may
entitle the holder to a refund, provided the required information is timely furnished to the Internal Revenue
Service.

**CERTAIN CANADIAN FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

Unless the context otherwise requires, in this section, the word “Company” refers only to Open Text
Corporation, and not any of its subsidiaries.

The following summary describes the principal Canadian federal income tax considerations pursuant to the
_Income Tax Act (Canada) and the regulations thereunder (the “Tax Act”) generally applicable to the acquisition,_
holding and disposition of notes by a holder who acquires, as beneficial owner, notes pursuant to this offering
memorandum and who, for purposes of the Tax Act and at all relevant times, (i) deals at arm’s length with the
Company, the guarantors and the initial purchasers, (ii) is not affiliated with the Company, the guarantors or the
initial purchasers, and (iii) holds the notes as capital property (a “Holder”). Notes will generally be considered to
be capital property to a Holder unless either the Holder holds the notes in the course of carrying on a business of
trading or dealing securities, or the Holder has held or acquired such notes in a transaction or transactions
considered to be an adventure or concern in the nature of trade.

This summary is not applicable to (i) a Holder that is a “financial institution” for purposes of the
“mark-to-market” rules in the Tax Act, (ii) a Holder an interest in which is a “tax shelter investment” (as defined
in the Tax Act), (iii) a Holder that has elected to report its “Canadian tax results” (as defined in the Tax Act) in a
currency other than Canadian currency, (iv) a Holder that has entered or will enter into a “derivative forward
agreement” (as defined in the Tax Act) in respect of notes. Such Holders should consult with their own tax
advisors.

This summary is based upon the current provisions of the Tax Act and an understanding of the current
published administrative policies and assessing practices of the Canada Revenue Agency made publicly available
prior to the date hereof. The summary also takes into account all specific proposals to amend the Tax Act that
have been publicly announced by or on behalf of the Minister of Finance (Canada) prior to the date hereof (the
“Tax Proposals”), and assumes that all such Tax Proposals will be enacted in the form proposed. However, no
assurance can be given that the Tax Proposals will be enacted as proposed or at all. This summary does not
otherwise take into account or anticipate any changes in law or administrative policy or assessing practice,
whether by way of legislative, judicial or administrative action or interpretation, nor does it address any
provincial, territorial or foreign tax considerations.

**This summary is of a general nature only and is not intended to be, nor should it be construed as, legal**
**or tax advice to any particular Holder, and no representations with respect to the income tax consequences**
**to any particular Holder are made. The income and other tax consequences of acquiring, holding or**
**disposing of notes will vary depending on a Holder’s particular circumstances. Consequently, prospective**
**Holders should consult their own tax advisors for advice with respect to the consequences to them of an**
**investment in the notes based on their particular circumstances.**

**Taxation of Holders Resident in Canada**

The following portion of this summary is applicable to a Holder who, at all relevant times, for the purposes
of the Tax Act, is resident, or is deemed to be resident, in Canada (a “Canadian Holder”). Certain Canadian
Holders who might not otherwise be considered to hold their notes as capital property may, in certain
circumstances, be entitled to make an irrevocable election pursuant to subsection 39(4) of the Tax Act, the effect
of which is to deem such notes and any other “Canadian security”, as defined in the Tax Act, owned by such
Canadian Holder in the taxation year in which the election is made and in all subsequent taxation years, to be
capital property.

**_Currency Conversion_**

The notes are denominated in U.S. dollars. For purposes of the Tax Act, all amounts relating to the
acquisition, holding or disposition of the notes generally must be converted into Canadian dollars using the rate

77


-----

of exchange quoted by the Bank of Canada for the relevant date, or such other rate of exchange as is acceptable
to the Minister of National Revenue (Canada). The amount of interest required to be included in the income of,
and capital gains or capital losses realized by, a Canadian Holder may be affected by currency fluctuations.

**_Taxation of Interest on the Notes_**

A Canadian Holder that is a corporation, partnership, unit trust or any trust of which a corporation or a
partnership is a beneficiary will generally be required to include in income for a taxation year the amount of
interest accrued or deemed to have accrued on the notes to the end of the taxation year or that becomes receivable
or is received by it before the end of the taxation year, to the extent such amounts have not otherwise been
included in such Canadian Holder’s income for a preceding taxation year.

Any other Canadian Holder, including an individual (other than certain trusts), will be required to include in
income for a taxation year any interest on the notes received or receivable by such Canadian Holder in the year
(depending upon the method regularly followed by the Canadian Holder in computing income) except to the
extent that such amount was otherwise included in its income for a preceding taxation year. If in a taxation year
such a Canadian Holder holds a note which is an “investment contract” (as defined in the Tax Act) on any
“anniversary day” (as defined in the Tax Act), such Canadian Holder will also be required to include in its
income for the taxation year any interest on the note which accrued to the Canadian Holder to the end of such
day, to the extent that such interest was not otherwise included in computing the Canadian Holder’s income for
the taxation year or a preceding taxation year.

Any premium paid by the Company to a Canadian Holder as a penalty or bonus on the redemption before
maturity of a note, or a purchase for cancellation before maturity, will be deemed to be received by such
Canadian Holder as interest on the note and will be required to be included in computing the Canadian Holder’s
income, as described above, at the time of the redemption or purchase for cancellation to the extent that such
premium can reasonably be considered to relate to, and does not exceed the value at the time of the redemption
or purchase for cancellation of, the interest that, but for the redemption or purchase for cancellation, would have
been paid or payable by the Company on the note for a taxation year ending after the redemption or purchase for
cancellation.

**_Sale, Redemption or Repayment of the Notes_**

On a disposition or a deemed disposition of a note, including a repayment, redemption or purchase by the
Company, a Canadian Holder will generally be required to include in income for the taxation year in which the
disposition occurs the amount of interest accrued or deemed to have accrued to the date of disposition, to the
extent that such amount has not otherwise been included in the Canadian Holder’s income for the year or a
preceding taxation year.

In general, a disposition or a deemed disposition of a note will give rise to a capital gain (or a capital loss) to
the extent that the proceeds of disposition, net of any amount included in the Canadian Holder’s income as
interest or deemed interest (as described above) and any reasonable costs of disposition, exceed (or are less than)
the adjusted cost base to the Canadian Holder of the note immediately before the disposition or deemed
disposition. Any such capital gain (or capital loss) will be subject to the treatment described under the heading
“Taxation of Capital Gains and Capital Losses” below.

**_Taxation of Capital Gains and Capital Losses_**

In general, one-half of any capital gain (a “taxable capital gain”) realized by a Canadian Holder in a taxation
year will be included in the Canadian Holder’s income in the year. One half of the amount of any capital loss (an
“allowable capital loss”) realized by a Canadian Holder in a taxation year must be deducted from taxable capital
gains realized by the Canadian Holder in the year and allowable capital losses in excess of taxable capital gains
in the year may be deducted in any of the three preceding taxation years or in any subsequent year against taxable
capital gains realized in such years, to the extent and under the circumstances described in the Tax Act.

78


-----

**_Additional Refundable Tax_**

A Canadian Holder that is a “Canadian-controlled private corporation” (as defined in the Tax Act) may be
liable to pay an additional refundable tax on certain investment income, including amounts in respect of interest
and taxable capital gains.

**_Alternative Minimum Tax_**

Individuals (other than certain trusts) may be subject to an alternative minimum tax under the Tax Act in
respect of net capital gains realized by them.

**_Eligibility for Investment_**

Provided that the Company has a class of shares listed on the date hereof on a “designated stock exchange”
within the meaning of the Tax Act (which currently includes the Toronto Stock Exchange), the notes, if issued on
the date hereof, would be qualified investments under the Tax Act on the date hereof for trusts governed by
registered retirement savings plans (“RRSPs”), registered retirement income funds (“RRIFs”), registered
disability savings plans (“RDSPs”), registered education savings plans (“RESPs”), deferred profit sharing plans
(other than a trust governed by a deferred profit sharing plan to which the Company, or any employer with which
the Company does not deal at arm’s length within the meaning of the Tax Act, has made a contribution), and tax
free savings accounts (“TFSAs”).

Notwithstanding that the notes may be a qualified investment for a trust governed by a TFSA, RDSP, RRSP,
RRIF or RESP, the holder of a TFSA or RDSP, the annuitant of an RRSP or RRIF or the subscriber of an RESP,
as the case may be, may be subject to a penalty tax in respect of the notes if such notes are a “prohibited
investment” for such TFSA, RDSP, RRSP, RRIF or RESP. The notes offered hereby would generally not be a
“prohibited investment” for a TFSA, RDSP, RRSP, RRIF or RESP provided the holder of such TFSA or RDSP,
the annuitant of such RRSP or RRIF or the subscriber of such RESP, as the case may be, (i) deals at arm’s length
with the Company for purposes of the Tax Act, and (ii) does not have a “significant interest” (within the meaning
of the Tax Act) in the Company. Prospective purchasers should consult their own tax advisors regarding whether
the notes would be a prohibited investment for a trust governed by a TFSA, RDSP, RRSP, RRIF or RESP in their
particular circumstances.

**Taxation of Holders Not Resident in Canada**

The following portion of the summary is generally applicable to a Holder who, for the purposes of the Tax
Act and at all relevant times (i) is not, and is not deemed to be, resident in Canada (including as a consequence of
an applicable income tax treaty or convention), (ii) deals at arm’s length with any transferee resident (or deemed
to be resident) in Canada to whom the Holder disposes of the notes, (iii) does not use or hold, and is not deemed
to use or hold, the notes in a business carried on or deemed to be carried on in Canada, (iv) is not an “authorized
foreign bank”, or an insurer carrying on an insurance business in Canada and elsewhere, and (v) is entitled to
receive all payments made in respect of the notes (including all principal and interest) (a “Non-Resident
Holder”). The following summary is also not applicable to a Non-Resident Holder that is a “specified
shareholder” (as defined in subsection 18(5) the Tax Act) of the Company, or that does not deal at arm’s length
for purposes of the Tax Act with a “specified shareholder” of the Company. Such Non-Resident Holders should
consult their own tax advisors. Generally, for this purpose, a “specified shareholder” is a person that owns or is
deemed to own, either alone or together with persons with whom the shareholder does not deal at arm’s length
for purposes of the Tax Act, shares of the Company’s capital stock that either (a) give the holders of such shares
25% or more of the votes that could be cast at an annual meeting of the shareholders or (b) have a fair market
value of 25% or more of the fair market value of all of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s
capital stock.

Amounts paid or credited, or deemed to be paid or credited, as, on account or in lieu of payment of, or in
satisfaction of, the principal of, interest on, or premium or bonus in respect of the notes by the Company to a

79


-----

Non-Resident Holder, including in respect of a redemption or purchase for cancellation of the notes, will not be
subject to Canadian withholding tax.

No taxes on income (including taxable capital gains) will be payable under the Tax Act by a Non-Resident
Holder on a disposition of the notes.

   - the obligation to purchase all of the notes offered hereby, if any of the notes are purchased;

   - the representations and warranties made by us and the guarantors to the initial purchasers are true;

   - there is no material adverse change in our and the guarantors’ business taken as a whole or the financial
markets; and

   - we and the guarantors deliver customary closing documents to the initial purchasers.

**Lock-Up**

We and the guarantors have agreed not to, directly or indirectly,

   - offer for sale, sell, pledge, or otherwise dispose of (or enter into any transaction or device that is
designed to, or would be expected to, result in the disposition by any person at any time in the future of)
any of our debt securities substantially similar to the notes or securities convertible into or exchangeable
for such debt securities, or sell or grant options, rights or warrants with respect to such debt securities or
securities convertible into or exchangeable for such debt securities,

   - enter into any swap or other derivatives transaction that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of
the economic benefits or risks of ownership of our debt securities, whether any such transaction
described in this bullet or the preceding bullet is to be settled by delivery of our debt securities or other

respect to the registration or qualification for distribution of our debt securities substantially similar to
the notes or securities convertible into or exchangeable for our debt securities, or

   - publicly announce an offering of any of our debt securities substantially similar to the notes or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for our debt securities,

for a period of commencing on the date hereof and ending on the 60th day after the date of this offering
memorandum, in each case without the prior written consent of Barclays Capital Inc., on behalf of the initial
purchasers; provided, however, that the foregoing will not restrict the ability of us, Open Text Holdings, Inc. or

**Indemnification**

We have agreed to indemnify the initial purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the
Securities Act, or to contribute to payments that the initial purchasers may be required to make for these

**Stabilization and Short Positions**

In connection with this offering, the initial purchasers may engage in certain transactions that stabilize,
maintain or otherwise affect the price of the notes. Specifically, the initial purchasers may overallot in connection
with this offering of the notes, creating a syndicate short position. In addition, the initial purchasers may bid for
and purchase notes in the open market to cover syndicate short positions or to stabilize the price of the notes.
Any of these activities may stabilize or maintain the market price of the notes above what it would be in the
absence of such activities. The initial purchasers are not required to engage in any of these activities, and they
may end any of them at any time. We, the guarantors and the initial purchasers make no representation as to the
direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes. In

**Relationships**

The initial purchasers and certain of their affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various
activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory,
investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities.
In particular, the Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates are initial purchasers for the Other Notes offering. The
initial purchasers and certain of their affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may in the future
perform, various commercial and investment banking and financial advisory services for the issuer and its
affiliates, for which they received or may in the future receive customary fees and expenses. For example,
affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers act as sole administrative agent and collateral agent and as lenders
under our Senior Credit Facilities.

Certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates may hold positions in the 2023 Notes. As a result, certain
of those initial purchasers or their affiliates may receive some of the proceeds from this offering and the Other
Notes offering.

One or more of the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates currently act as lenders under the Revolver
and, as such, will receive a pro rata portion of the net proceeds from this offering and the Other Notes offering
used to reduce amounts outstanding under the Revolver.

In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the initial purchasers and certain of their affiliates
may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative
securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their
customers, and such investment and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the

82


-----

Company or its affiliates. Certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us
and certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates routinely hedge and certain other of the initial purchasers or
their affiliates may hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies.
Typically, the initial purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions
which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities or
the securities of our affiliates, including potentially the notes offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or
short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the notes offered hereby. The initial purchasers and
certain of their affiliates may also communicate independent investment recommendations, market color or
trading ideas and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or instruments
and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such
securities and instruments.

Several of the initial purchasers are our customers and purchase products and services from us in the
ordinary course of business.

**Rule 144A and Regulation S**

The notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws, and unless so
registered, may not be offered or sold within the United States, or to or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons
(as defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act) except pursuant to an exemption from or in a transaction
not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. See “Notice
to Investors.”

We have been advised by the initial purchasers that the initial purchasers propose to resell these notes to
(a) persons they reasonably believe to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the
Securities Act and (b) outside the U.S. to certain non-U.S. persons in reliance on Regulation S under the
Securities Act. See “Notice to Investors”. Any offer or sale of the notes in reliance on Rule 144A will be made by
broker-dealers who are registered as such under the Exchange Act.

Each of the initial purchasers has acknowledged and agreed that, except as permitted by the purchase
agreement, in connection with sales outside the United States, it will not offer, sell or deliver the notes to, or for
the account or benefit of U.S. persons (a) as part of their distribution at any time or (b) otherwise until 40 days
after the later of the commencement of this offering or the date the notes were originally issued. The initial
purchasers will send to each dealer to whom they sell the notes in reliance on Regulation S during the 40-day
distribution compliance period, a confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of
the notes within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. Terms used in this
paragraph have the meanings assigned to them in Regulation S under the Securities Act.

In addition, until the expiration of the 40-day distribution compliance period referred to above, an offer or
sale of the notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in this offering) may violate
the registration requirements of the Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with
Rule 144A under the Securities Act or pursuant to another exemption from registration under the Securities Act.

**No Prior Market**

The notes have no established trading market and will not be listed on any national securities exchange or
quotation system. The initial purchasers have advised us of their intention to make a market for the notes, but
have no obligation to do so and may in their discretion discontinue market-making at any time without providing
any notice. We cannot assure you as to the liquidity of any trading market for the notes that may develop.

We do not intend to register the notes for resale under the Securities Act, or to offer to exchange the notes
for registered notes under the Securities Act, or to file a prospectus to qualify the resale of the notes under
Canadian Securities Laws.

83


-----

**Settlement**

Delivery of the notes will be made on or about, 2020, which will be the tenth business day
following the date of pricing of the notes (such settlement cycle being herein referred to as “T+10”). Under Rule
15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business
days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade
the notes prior to their date of delivery may be required, by virtue of the fact that the notes initially will settle
T+10, to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement.
Purchasers of notes who wish to trade notes prior to their date of delivery hereunder should consult their own
advisor.

**Selling Restrictions**

This offering memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell to, or a solicitation of an offer to buy from,
anyone in any country or jurisdiction (i) in which such an offer or solicitation is not authorized, (ii) in which any
person making such offer or solicitation is not qualified to do so or (iii) in which any such offer or solicitation
would otherwise be unlawful. No action has been taken that would, or is intended to, permit a public offer of the
notes or possession or distribution of this offering memorandum or any other offering or publicity material
relating to the notes in any country or jurisdiction where any such action for that purpose is required.

**_European Economic Area_**

The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold
or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA or the UK. For these purposes, a retail investor
means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or
(ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not
qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor
as defined in the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently no key information document required by the PRIIPs
Regulation for offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA or
in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to
any retail investor in the EEA or in the UK may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation

Each person in a member state of the EEA (a “Member State”) who receives any communication in respect
of, or who acquires any notes under, the offers contemplated in this offering memorandum will be deemed to
have represented, warranted and agreed to and with each initial purchaser, us and the guarantors that:

(a) it is a qualified investor as defined in Article 2(e) of the Prospectus Regulation; and

(b) in the case of any notes acquired by it as a financial intermediary, as that term is used in Article 1(4) of
the Prospectus Regulation, (i) the notes acquired by it in this offering have not been acquired on behalf
of, nor have they been acquired with a view to their offer or resale to, persons in any Member State
other than qualified investors (as defined in the Prospectus Regulation), or in the circumstances in
which the prior consent of the representative of the initial purchasers has been given to the offer or
resale or (ii) where notes have been acquired by it on behalf of persons in any Member State other than
qualified investors, the offer of such notes to it is not treated under the Prospectus Regulation as having
been made to such persons.

For the purposes of this representation and the provision above, the expression an “offer to the public” in
relation to any notes in any Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient
information on the terms of the offer and any notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase
or subscribe for the notes.

84


-----

**_United Kingdom_**

Each initial purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that:

(a) it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of
Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of the notes in
circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to us; and

(b) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything
done by it in relation to the notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

In the United Kingdom, this offering memorandum is for distribution only to, and is only directed at, and
any offer of the notes subsequently made may only be directed at persons who (i) have professional experience in
matters relating to investments falling within Article 19(5) of the Order, (ii) are persons falling within Article
43(2) of the Order, (iii) are persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (high net worth companies,
unincorporated associations, etc.) of the Order or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage
in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) in connection with the issue or sale of any
notes may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons together being
“relevant persons”). Any person in the United Kingdom that is not a relevant person should not act or rely on the
information included in this offering memorandum or use it as a basis for taking any action. In the United
Kingdom, the notes are only available to, and any invitation, offer or agreement to subscribe, purchase or
otherwise acquire such notes will be engaged in only with relevant persons.

**_The Netherlands_**

The notes may only be offered, sold or delivered in The Netherlands to qualified investors (gekwalificeerde
beleggers) (as defined in the Dutch Financial Supervision Act (Wet op het financieel toezicht), as amended from
time to time) that do not qualify as “public” (within the meaning of the article 4(1) Capital Requirements
Regulation (Regulation (EU) 575/2013) and the rules promulgated thereunder, as amended or any subsequent
legislation replacing that regulation).

deemed to have made the following acknowledgements, representations to and agreements with us, the
guarantors and the initial purchasers:

(1) You acknowledge that:

initial purchasers as to the accuracy or completeness of such materials. You represent that you are relying
only on this offering memorandum in making your investment decision with respect to the notes. You agree
that you have had access to such financial and other information concerning us, the guarantors and the notes
as you have deemed necessary in connection with your decision to purchase notes, including an opportunity

requirement of law that the disposition of your property or the property of that investor account or accounts
be at all times within your or their control and subject to your or their ability to resell the notes pursuant to
Rule 144A or any other available exemption from registration under the Securities Act. You agree on your
own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which you are purchasing notes, and each subsequent

under the Securities Act) that is not a qualified institutional buyer and that is purchasing for its own
account or for the account of another institutional accredited investor, in each case in a minimum
principal amount of notes of $250,000; or

(f) under any other available exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act,

subject in each of the above cases to any requirement of law that the disposition of the seller’s
property or the property of an investor account or accounts be at all times within the seller or account’s
control and to compliance with any applicable state securities laws.

You also acknowledge that to the extent that you hold the notes through an interest in a global

after the applicable Resale Restriction Period ends;

 - if a holder of notes proposes to resell or transfer notes under clause (e) above before the applicable
Resale Restriction Period ends, the seller must deliver to us and the U.S. trustee a letter from the
