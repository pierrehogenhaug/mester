the United States, its territories and possessions, any state of the United States or the District of Columbia
(“possessions” include Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, Wake Island and
the Northern Mariana Islands), the stated electronic mail address to which this e-mail has been delivered is not
located in the United States and that you or any customers you represent consent to delivery of such Offering
Memorandum by electronic transmission.

You are reminded that the Offering Memorandum has been delivered to you on the basis that you are a person
into whose possession the Offering Memorandum may be lawfully delivered in accordance with the laws of


-----

jurisdiction in which you are located and you may not, nor are you authorized to, deliver the Offering
Memorandum to any other person. You may not transmit the attached Offering Memorandum (or any copy of it
or part thereof) or disclose, whether orally or in writing, any of its contents to any other person, except with the
consent of the Initial Purchasers. If you receive this document by e-mail, you should not reply by e-mail to this
announcement. Any reply e-mail communications, including those you generate by using the “Reply” function on
your e-mail software, will be ignored or rejected. If you receive this document by e-mail, your use of this e-mail
is at your own risk and it is your responsibility to take precautions to ensure that it is free from viruses and other
items of a destructive nature.

The materials relating to the offering do not constitute, and may not be used in connection with, an offer or
solicitation in any place where offers or solicitations are not permitted by law. If a jurisdiction requires that the
offering be made by a licensed broker or dealer and the Initial Purchasers or any affiliate of the Initial Purchasers
is a licensed broker or dealer in that jurisdiction, the offering shall be deemed to be made by the Initial Purchasers
or such affiliate on behalf of the Issuer (as defined in the Offering Memorandum) in such jurisdiction. Under no
circumstances shall the Offering Memorandum constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor
shall there be any sale of, these securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be
unlawful.

**_Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors: The securities described in the Offering Memorandum are not_**
intended to be offered, sold, distributed or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold, distributed
or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). For the purposes
of this provision, the expression retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of the following: (i) a retail
client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 2014/65/EU (as
amended, “MiFID II”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended from time to
time, the “Insurance Mediation Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as
defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU)
2017/1129 (the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation
(EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended from time to time, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering, selling or distributing
the securities or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore
offering, selling or distributing the securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA
may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

The Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the securities referred to therein in
any Member State of the EEA (“Member State”) will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus
Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the securities referred to therein.
Accordingly, any person making or intending to make an offer in a Member State of securities which are the
subject of the offering contemplated in the Offering Memorandum may only do so in circumstances in which no
obligation arises for the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the
Prospectus Regulation, in each case, in relation to such offer. Neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers have
authorized, nor do they authorize, the making of any offer of securities in circumstances in which an obligation
arises for the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers to publish a prospectus for such offer.

_MiFID II product governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target market: Solely for the purposes of_
any relevant Initial Purchaser that considers itself a manufacturer (each a “Manufacturer”), the target market
assessment in respect of the debt securities described in the attached Offering Memorandum has led to the
conclusion that: (i) the target market for such debt securities is eligible counterparties and professional clients
only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of
such debt securities to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently
offering, selling or recommending such debt securities (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the
Manufacturer’s target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking
its own target market assessment in respect of such debt securities (by either adopting or refining the
Manufacturer’s target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**_Prohibition of Sales to UK Retail Investors: The securities described in the Offering Memorandum are not_**
intended to be offered, sold, distributed or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold, distributed
or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (“UK”). For the purposes of this
provision, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of the following: (i) a retail client as defined in
point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European
Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA
and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement the Insurance Mediation Directive, where that
customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No
600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently, no key information document


-----

required by the PRIIPs Regulation as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs
Regulation”) for offering, selling or distributing the securities or otherwise making them available to retail
investors in the UK or the United Kingdom has been prepared and therefore offering, selling or distributing the
securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK
PRIIPs Regulation or the United Kingdom.

The Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the securities referred to therein in
the UK will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation as it forms part of domestic law
by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK Prospectus Regulation”) from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers
of the securities referred to therein. Accordingly, any person making or intending to make an offer in the UK of
securities which are the subject of the offering contemplated in the Offering Memorandum may only do so in
circumstances in which no obligation arises for the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers to publish a prospectus pursuant
to Article 3 of the UK Prospectus Regulation, in each case, in relation to such offer. Neither the Issuer nor the
Initial Purchasers have authorized, nor do they authorize, the making of any offer of securities in circumstances
in which an obligation arises for the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers to publish a prospectus for such offer.

_UK MIFIR product governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target market: Solely for the purposes of_
the product approval process of the Initial Purchasers that considers itself a manufacturer pursuant to the FCA
Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product Governance
Rules”) (the “UK Manufacturer”), the target market assessment in respect of the securities has led to the
conclusion that: (i) the target market for the securities is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA
Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook, and professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014
as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii)
all channels for distribution of the securities to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate.
Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the notes (a “UK distributor”) should take into
consideration the UK Manufacturer’s target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the UK MiFIR
Product Governance Rules is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the
securities (by either adopting or refining the UK Manufacturer’s target market assessment) and determining
appropriate distribution channels.

The Offering Memorandum has not been approved by an authorized person in the United Kingdom and is for
distribution only to persons (i) who have professional experience in matters relating to investments (being
investment professionals falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial
Promotion) Order 2005 (as amended, the “Financial Promotion Order”)), (ii) falling within Article 49(2)(a) to
(d) (“high net worth companies, unincorporated associations, etc.”) of the Financial Promotion Order, (iii) who
are outside the United Kingdom or (iv) to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity
(within the meaning of section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) in connection with the issue
or sale of any securities may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons
together being referred to as “relevant persons”). The Offering Memorandum is directed only at relevant persons

activity to which the Offering Memorandum relates is available only to relevant persons and will be engaged in
only with relevant persons. No part of the Offering Memorandum should be published, reproduced, distributed or
otherwise made available in whole or in part to any other person.

No person may communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment
activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) received by it in
connection with the issue or sale of the securities other than in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 does not apply to us.

**eircom Finance DAC**

**€400,000,000     % Senior Secured Notes due 2029**


_____________

eircom Finance DAC (the “Issuer”) is offering (the “Offering”) €400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its     % senior secured notes due 2029 (the “Notes”).


The Notes will bear interest at a rate of     % and will mature on    , 2029. Interest on the Notes will accrue from the Issue Date (as defined below) and will be payable

semi-annually on     and    , commencing on    , 2024.

Prior to    , 2026, the Issuer will be entitled at its option to redeem all or a portion of the Notes by paying a “make whole” premium. On or after    , 2026, the Issuer

will be entitled at its option to redeem all or a portion of the Notes, at any time or from time to time, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at the redemption prices set forth
in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, at any time prior to      2026, the Issuer may redeem at its option up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes with the net cash
proceeds from certain equity offerings at the redemption price specified herein, provided that at least 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes remains outstanding after
the redemption. Furthermore, the Notes may be redeemed at a price equal to their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest upon the occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax
law. Upon the occurrence of certain change of control events or asset sales, the Issuer may be required to offer to repurchase the Notes at 101% or 100% of the principal amount thereof,
respectively, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of the repurchase. In the event of certain developments affecting taxation, the Issuer may redeem all, but not less than all, of the
Notes. In addition, in connection with certain tender offers for the Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of such outstanding Notes validly tender and do not
withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer purchases all of such Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by
such holders, the Issuer or such third-party will have the right to redeem, in whole but not in part, such Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price equal to the price
offered to other holders of such Notes.

The Notes will be senior secured obligations of the Issuer and will rank equal in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s existing and future indebtedness that is not subordinated

in right of payment to the Notes, rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, be effectively senior
to all of the Issuer’s existing and future unsecured indebtedness to the extent of the assets securing the Notes and be contractually subordinated in right of payment to certain hedging
obligations. The Notes will be guaranteed on a senior secured basis (the “Guarantees”) by eircom Limited (Jersey) (the “Company”), eircom Holdings (Ireland) Limited (“EHIL”) and by
certain of EHIL’s subsidiaries (each, a “Guarantor” and together the “Guarantors”), all of which are guarantors of, or borrowers under, our existing senior secured facilities (the “Senior
Facilities”). Subject to certain limitations under applicable law, the Guarantees will rank equal in right of payment with all existing and future senior indebtedness of the Guarantors that is
not subordinated in right of payment to the Guarantees, rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness of the Guarantors that is subordinated in right of payment to
the Guarantees, be effectively senior to all of the Guarantors’ existing and future unsecured indebtedness to the extent of the assets securing the Guarantees and be contractually subordinated
in right of payment to certain hedging obligations and potentially future debt under super senior revolving credit facilities. Within 90 days following the Issue Date (as defined below), the
Notes and their Guarantees will be secured by security interests over the same assets that secure the Senior Facilities and certain hedging obligations, including equity interests, bank accounts,
intercompany receivables and other assets of the Issuer, the Guarantors and Wexford Ltd subject to certain excluded assets, agreed security principles and perfection requirements. The
collateral securing the Notes and the Senior Facilities may also secure certain additional indebtedness in the future. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined herein),
proceeds from the enforcement of the security will be applied to repay indebtedness in respect of certain hedging obligations and potentially future debt under super senior revolving credit
facilities in priority to the Notes. The security interests and Guarantees, as well as certain claims against the Issuer, will be subject to contractual and legal limitations, including limitations
under Irish law. Security interests and Guarantees may be released under certain circumstances.

For a detailed description of the Notes, see “Description of the Notes” beginning on page 157.


There is no public market for the Notes. Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the “Authority”) for the listing of the Notes on the

Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”) and permission to deal in the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Notes will be listed on the Official List of the
Exchange or that such permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange will be granted. This preliminary offering memorandum (the “Offering Memorandum”) may not
be reproduced or used for any other purpose, nor be furnished to any other person other than those to whom copies have been sent.

_____________


**Investing in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. See “Risk Factors“ beginning on page 28.**


_____________

**Offering Price for the Notes:     % of principal plus accrued interest, if any, from the Issue Date.**


**None of the Notes and the Guarantees of the Notes have been, or will be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “U.S. Securities Act”), or**

**the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and may not be offered, sold or delivered within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (as defined in**
**Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act) except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. The**

**Notice to investors in the European Economic Area**

**European Economic Area**

The Initial Purchasers have represented and agreed that it has not offered, sold or otherwise made

available and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available, any Notes that are the subject of the Offering
contemplated by this Offering Memorandum to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). For
these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11)
of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended from time to time, “MiFID II”) or (ii) a customer within the
meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended from time to time, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where
that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or
(iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended from time to time, the
“Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently, no key information document required by the PRIIPS Regulation for
offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared
and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA
may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation. This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that
any offer of the Notes in any member state of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus
Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of notes. This Offering Memorandum is not a
prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

Each subscriber for or purchaser of the Notes in the Offering located within a member state of the EEA

will be deemed to have represented, acknowledged and agreed that it is not a retail investor. We, the Initial
Purchasers and their affiliates and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the foregoing representation,
acknowledgement and agreement.

_MiFID II Product Governance / professional investors and eligible counterparties only target market:_

Solely for the purposes of the product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has
led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is “eligible counterparties” and “professional clients”
only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and
professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a
“distributor”) should take into consideration the Manufacturer’s target market assessment; however, a distributor
subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by
either adopting or refining the Manufacturer’s target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution
channels.

**Grand Duchy of Luxembourg**

and accordingly this Offering Memorandum should not be construed as a prospectus neither in accordance with

The Luxembourg financial sector supervisory commission (Commission de Surveillance du Secteur

Financier) has not reviewed or approved this Offering Memorandum or any other document related to the offering

Notes may not be publicly offered for sale in Luxembourg and no steps may be taken which would constitute or
result in a public offering in Luxembourg as defined in the Law of July 16, 2019 on prospectuses for securities.
This document is intended for the confidential use of the offeree(s) it is intended for, and may not be reproduced
or used for any other purpose.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes referred to herein

Memorandum may only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for us or the Initial Purchasers to
publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the UK Prospectus Regulation, in each case, in relation to such offer.
Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers have authorized, nor do they authorize, the making of any offer of Notes in
circumstances in which an obligation arises for us or the Initial Purchasers to publish a prospectus for such offer.

The Notes described in this Offering Memorandum are not intended to be offered, sold, distributed or

otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold, distributed or otherwise made available to any retail
investor in the United Kingdom. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i)
a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic

This Offering Memorandum includes forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements can

be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the terms “believes,” “estimates,”
“anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “may,” “will” or “should” or, in each case, their negative, or other variations
or comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements include all matters that are not historical facts.
They appear in a number of places throughout this Offering Memorandum and include statements regarding our
intentions, beliefs or current expectations concerning, among other things, our results of operations, financial
condition, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies and the industry in which we operate.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events

and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. We caution you that forward-looking
statements are not guarantees of future performance and that our actual results of operations, financial condition
and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which we operate may differ materially from those made in
or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, even if our
results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and the development of the industry in which we operate are
consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum, those results or
developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. Important factors that could
cause those differences include, but are not limited to:

##### • the impact of a potential downturn in the Irish economy and general global economic conditions;

 • increasing competition in the Irish telecommunications market;

 • consolidation in the Irish telecommunications market;

 • substitution of other services for our products and services;

 • our ability to successfully implement our strategy to reduce churn and gain new subscribers;

 • extensive regulation and regulatory initiatives aimed at increasing competition;

 • our ability to successfully compete in data services;

 • increased competition in the broadband market as a result of government initiatives;

 • our ability to maintain our favorable brand image and develop new brands;

 • changes in technologies and markets that require us to make substantial investments in our network and
systems;

##### • our ability to achieve anticipated returns on investments;

 • dependence on third parties to distribute products, provide customer care and procure customers;

 • our ability to effectively deploy new or enhanced technologies;

 • our ability to implement our cost saving measures;

 • our dependence on the proper functioning of, and our ability to continuously upgrade, our network, IT,
and other systems; and

##### • other factors discussed or referred to in this Offering Memorandum.

We urge you to read the sections of this Offering Memorandum entitled “Risk Factors,” “Management’s

_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” “Business” and “Regulation” for a_
more complete discussion of the factors that could affect our future performance and the industry in which we
operate. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events described in this offering
memorandum may not occur.

We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of

new information, future events or otherwise. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements
attributable to us or to persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary
statements referred to above and contained elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA**

Unless otherwise indicated, statements in this offering memorandum regarding the market environment,

market developments, growth rates, market trends and the competitive situation in the markets and segments in
which we operate are based on data, statistical information, sector reports and third-party studies as well as on our
own estimates.

We operate in an industry in which it is difficult to obtain precise industry and market information. We

have generally obtained the market and competitive position data in this offering memorandum from the following
reports:

##### • Reports published by The Commission for Communications Regulation (“ComReg”), the Irish
telecommunications regulator, including the latest report containing market information as of
March 31, 2024, published on June 6, 2024 (22/44);

##### • Data gathered and published by ComReg’s Radio Spectrum Awards on ComReg’s website;

 • Statistics and data gathered and published by the Office for National Statistics; 

 • Statistics and data gathered and published by the European Statistical System (“Eurostat”); 

 • The UK Office of Communications (“Ofcom”) Communications Market Report “Pricing trends
for communications services in the UK,” published on December 1, 2022;

##### • Data published on Euronext Dublin’s website; 

 • Report published by Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (“BEREC”),
titled “Termination rates at European level” report published by in June 2021;

##### • SIRO website;

 • National Broadband Ireland (NBI) website;

 • Open eir website;

 • Liberty Global Ltd 10K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023;

 • The European Commission’s Spring 2024 and 2022 Economic Forecast; and

 • Ampere Analysis.

To the extent that information was taken from third parties, such information has been accurately

reproduced by us in this offering memorandum and, as far as we are aware and able to ascertain from the
information published by these third parties, no facts have been omitted which would render the reproduced
information inaccurate or misleading. Moreover, market studies and analyses, however, are frequently based on
information and assumptions that may not be accurate or technically correct, and their methodology is by nature
forward-looking and speculative.

We have not verified the figures, market data and other information used by third parties in our studies,

publications and financial information, or the external sources on which our estimates are based. We therefore
assume no liability for and offer no guarantee of the accuracy of the data from studies and third-party sources
contained in this offering memorandum or for the accuracy of data on which our estimates are based.

This offering memorandum also contains estimations of market data and information derived from such

data that cannot be obtained from publications by market research institutes or from other independent sources.
Such information is partly based on our own market observations, the evaluation of industry information (such as
from conferences and sector events) or internal assessments. We believe that our estimates of market data and the
information we have derived from such data helps investors to better understand the industry we operate in and
our position within it. Our own estimates have not been checked or verified externally. We nevertheless assume
that our own market observations are reliable. We give no warranty for the accuracy of our own estimates and the
information derived from them. They may differ from estimates made by our competitors or from future studies
conducted by market research institutes or other independent sources.

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL DATA**

**Financial Information**

**_IFRS Financial Data_**

In this Offering Memorandum, we include the following historical consolidated financial information for

EHIL, the ultimate parent company of our restricted group:

    - The unaudited consolidated financial statements of EHIL for the three months ended March 31,
2024, including comparative information for the period ended March 31, 2023 and notes thereto
(the “Unaudited Interim Financial Statements”), which have been prepared in accordance with
the International Accounting Standard 34 Interim Financial Reporting (“IAS 34”);

    - The audited consolidated financial statement of EHIL as and for the financial year ended
December 31, 2023 and notes thereto (the “2023 Audited Financial Statements”), which have
been audited by Grant Thornton and have been prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (“IFRS”); and

    - The audited consolidated financial statement of EHIL as and for the financial year ended
December 31, 2022 and notes thereto (the “2022 Audited Financial Statements”) which have
been audited by Ernst & Young, Chartered Accountants and have been prepared in accordance
with IFRS.

The 2022 Audited Statements, Unaudited Interim Financial Statements and the 2023 Audited Financial

statements are hereinafter referred to as the “Financial Statements.”

Ernst & Young, Chartered Accountants resigned as auditors to EHIL effective August 18, 2023,

subsequent to which Grant Thornton were appointed as auditors.

_Comparability_

On March 23, 2022, we sold our joint venture Tetra Ireland Communications Limited (“Tetra”). The

financial information and commentary presented in this Offering Memorandum includes the results of our joint
venture in Tetra on a proportionate consolidation basis to March 23, 2022. See also “—Non-IFRS Financial
_Measures—Adjusted Financial Data.”_

_LTM Financial Information_

Financial information of EHIL for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 presented in this Offering

Memorandum was calculated by taking the results of operations for the financial year ended December 31, 2023,
subtracting the results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2023, and adding it to the results of
operations of EHIL for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The financial information for the twelve months
ended March 31, 2024 for EHIL is not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the financial
year ended December 31, 2024, and should not be used as the basis for or prediction of an annualized calculation.
Such financial information is a non-IFRS measure.

**_Non-IFRS Financial Measures_**

_Adjusted Financial Data_

In addition to financial data described above, in this offering memorandum, we present certain adjusted

financial data that gives effect to changes in our accounting policies.

In this offering memorandum, unless stated otherwise, we present our results of operations for the

financial years ended December 31, 2022, on an adjusted basis, applying the proportionate method of accounting
rather than the equity method of accounting in reflecting Tetra’s results in our consolidated financial statements
as we believe such a presentation provides a more meaningful view of our results of operations. In accordance
with IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’, the EHIL consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended
December 31, 2022 apply the equity method of accounting to Tetra’s results.

_Other Non-IFRS Financial Data_

We present certain other Non-IFRS financial data in this Offering Memorandum including EBITDA,

Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (excluding impact of IFRS 15 and IFRS 16), EBITDA margin, Adjusted
EBITDA margin, capital expenditure, net working capital movement, net debt and certain leverage and coverage


-----

ratios. These are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance
with, IFRS. These measures are not measures of our financial performance under IFRS and should not be
considered in isolation or as an alternative to operating profit, cash flow from operating activities or any other
measures of performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with IFRS.

We present non-IFRS measures because we believe that they and similar measures are widely used by

certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance or
because we believe they provide more useful comparison to prior historical periods. Non-IFRS measures may not
be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, have limitations as analytical tools and should not
be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our operating result as reported under IFRS. Other
companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently and, consequently, our presentation may not
be readily comparable to other companies’ figures. In particular, you should not consider EBITDA, Adjusted
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (excluding impact of IFRS 15 and IFRS 16), EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA
margin, capital expenditure, net working capital movement, net debt and certain leverage and coverage ratios as
an alternative to (a) revenue as a measure of our sales, (b) operating profit (as determined in accordance with
IFRS) as a measure of our operating performance, (c) cash flows from operations, investing and financing
activities as a measure of our ability to meet our cash needs or (d) any other measures of performance under
generally accepted accounting principles. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (excluding impact of
IFRS 16 and IFRS 16), EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA margin, capital expenditure, net working capital
movement, net debt and certain leverage and coverage ratios have limitations as analytical tools, and you should
not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under IFRS.

_Adjusted EBITDA_

We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for cash pension charge, non-cash lease contracts,

management charge, exceptional items, and profit on disposal of property, plant and equipment.

_Adjusted EBITDA (excluding impact of IFRS 15 and 16)_

We define Adjusted EBITDA (excluding impact of IFRS 15 and 16) as Adjusted EBITDA adjusted to

exclude the impact of IFRS 15 and IFRS 16.

_Adjusted EBITDA Margin_

We defined Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue.

_Pro Forma Financial Data_

In this Offering Memorandum, we present certain unaudited pro forma financial information, which gives

effect to the Transactions as though they had occurred on March 31, 2024 for the purposes of balance sheet data
and as of April 1, 2023 for the purposes of income statement data. The unaudited pro forma data is provided for
illustrative purposes only and do not purport to represent what our actual results of operations or financial position
would have been if the Transactions had occurred in case of debt metrics, on March 31, 2024 or, in case of interest
expense, on April 1, 2023. The unaudited pro forma data set out in this Offering Memorandum is based upon
available information and certain assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable.

_Rounding Adjustments_

Rounding adjustments have been made in calculating some of the financial information included in this

Offering Memorandum in order that the totals in some tables equal the arithmetic aggregations of the figures that
precede them.

**Overview**

We are the sole telecommunications provider in Ireland that offers quad-play bundles on an integrated

network, and we offer a range of retail and wholesale services. We are the principal provider of fixed line
telecommunications and the third largest mobile telecommunications provider in Ireland.

Our fixed line division provides high-speed broadband, voice and data services to individual consumers,

business users and to wholesale customers. The fixed line division contributed 72% of our revenue (before intersegment eliminations) and 74% of our Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve month period ended March 31, 2024. We
have an extensive fixed line telecommunications network in Ireland in terms of both capacity and geographic
reach. According to quarterly data published by ComReg (Source: ComReg report 22/44), we had a market share
for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 of 37.9% of the Irish retail and wholesale fixed line market, based on
revenue. Our mobile division provides standalone mobile services to consumer and business customers and is also
included as part of our bundled offerings. The mobile business contributed 28% of our total revenue (before intersegment eliminations) and 26% of our Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve month period ended March 31, 2024.
Our revenue for the twelve month period ended March 31, 2024 was €1,299 million and our Adjusted EBITDA
for the twelve month period ended March 31, 2024 was €639 million.

We are focused on convergence and long-term customer lifetime value, and our strategy is to connect

everyone and everything in Ireland, whether by high-speed broadband, voice, mobile data or enterprise
datacomms. This strategy is underpinned by a major program of capital expenditure which has facilitated the
transformation of our business. Our vision for our customers is a converged future with seamless access to
fixed and mobile services.

We are currently well underway investing €500 million to roll-out fiber to the home (“FTTH”) to 1.9

million premises across urban and suburban Ireland, while also investing €250 million updating and expanding
our mobile network with a view to significantly increasing our high-speed mobile data capabilities, rolling out
Ireland’s largest 5G network and expanding 4G coverage to 99% of the outdoor geography of Ireland.

**_Fixed line services_**

We are the largest provider of fixed line telecommunications services in Ireland, offering broadband,

voice, TV, datacomms and managed services to individual consumers and business users under the eir brand. We
also offer other authorized operators (“OAOs”) a range of wholesale services including high-speed broadband,
voice and managed services under our open eir brand. According to quarterly data published by ComReg (Source:
ComReg 24/44), we had a market share for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 of 37.9% of the Irish retail and
wholesale fixed line market, based on revenue. We have an extensive fixed line telecommunications network in
Ireland in terms of both capacity and geographic reach. We are also the leading provider of broadband services in
Ireland with 463,000 retail and 485,000 wholesale customers as of March 31, 2024, and an overall market share
of 27.9% of retail fixed broadband as of March 31, 2024. As of March 31, 2024, we had approximately 582,000
access lines in service (including standalone broadband (“SABB”) and wholesale Local Loop Unbundling
(“LLU”)).

Revenue (before inter-segment eliminations) from our fixed line services was €962 million for the twelve

month period ended March 31, 2024. Adjusted EBITDA from our fixed line services was €476 million for the
twelve month period ended March 31, 2024.

**_Mobile services_**

We are the third largest mobile operator in Ireland in terms of revenue and customers. Our Mobile

division is comprised of both consumer and eir business mobile. According to data published by ComReg for the
quarter ended March 31, 2024, we had an overall mobile market share of 14.7% based on the number of
subscribers, including mobile broadband, a market principally comprised of three large players: Vodafone Ireland
Ltd (“Vodafone”), Three Ireland (Hutchinson) Limited (“Three”) and eir. Our strategy is to maximize customer
lifetime value within the mobile business whether through standalone propositions or bundling with fixed line
services.


-----

As of March 31, 2024, approximately 78% of our customer base was in postpay contracts and the

remainder in prepay contracts. Revenue for our mobile division was €374 million for the twelve month period
ended March 31, 2024. Adjusted EBITDA of the mobile division was €163 million for the twelve month period
ended March 31, 2024. Adjusted EBITDA margin of the mobile division was 44% for the twelve month period
ended March 31, 2024.

**Our Strengths**

**_A strong Irish macroeconomic environment supports an attractive telecommunications market with balanced_**
**_market shares_**

We operate in Ireland, a country with strong macroeconomic growth drivers and an attractive

telecommunications market. We believe eir is well-positioned to benefit from the positive trends in this market.

With a growing population of approximately 5.3 million as of 2023, a 2.0% increase since 2020, Ireland

is a developed market economy with nominal GDP per capita in 2023 of €95,280 compared to the EU27 average
of €37,620 and to £39,315 for the UK (Source: Eurostat, Office for National Statistics). Ireland has a healthy
economy which in the recent past significantly outperformed the EU27 average, growing at a 7.1% on average
over 2021-2023 in real GDP terms, compared to the EU27 average of 3.3% and UK’s average of 4.4% for the
same period. In 2023, the Irish economy recorded a real GDP decline of 3.2%, compared to 0.4% growth for the
EU27 and 0.1% growth for the UK in the same year. According to the European Economic Forecast – Spring
2024, Ireland’s recent economic contraction was primarily driven by the weak performance of specific
multinational-dominated sectors. Specifically, modified domestic demand, which better reflects the underlying
domestic economic activity, grew marginally by 0.5%, impacted by elevated inflation and tight financial
conditions. Preliminary real GDP estimates show that the Irish economy has started to rebound, and real GDP is
expected to grow by 1.2% in 2024 and by 3.6% in 2025 (Source: Spring European Economic Forecast 2024). Irish
unemployment continues to show significant improvement, having declined from the high levels of 15.5% in 2012
during the economic downturn following the global financial crisis, down to 5.8% in 2018 and down to 4.3% in
2023 (Source: Eurostat). This is in line with the 2023 unemployment rate of 4.0% in the UK and compares
favorably to the EU27 average unemployment rate of 6.1% in 2023 (Source: Eurostat, Office for National
Statistics). Furthermore, 10-year Irish sovereign bond yields trade at approximately 2.6% versus approximately
0% seven years ago (Source: Euronext Dublin website), reflecting the rebound in the Irish economy. Ireland also
benefits from having a young population relative to other European countries with a median age of 39 years,
compared to 45 years for EU27 and 41 years for the UK (as of 2022) (Source: Eurostat, Office for National
Statistics).

The Irish telecommunications market, which includes fixed line, mobile and broadcasting (including

cable) sectors, accounted for an estimated €0.9 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, and €3.7 billion in
retail revenues for the twelve-month period December 31, 2023 (Source: ComReg 24/44). The fixed broadband
market is comprised of four main competitors: eir, Vodafone, Virgin Media, and Sky Ireland, with an additional
group of other smaller operators. Of the main operators, we have the leading market share based on fixed
broadband subscriptions at 27.9% as of March 31, 2024 (Source: ComReg 24/44). Based on the combined retail
and wholesale fixed broadband market in Ireland, we are the leaders capturing approximately 59.7% of the total
market for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, followed by Virgin Media with 23.8%, SIRO with 11.5% and NBI
with 4.8% (Source: ComReg 24/44 and company analysis). Furthermore, we have an extensive fiber infrastructure
covering approximately 65% of Irish premises. Ireland’s household broadband penetration rate, at 79.2% as of
December 31, 2023 (78.3% as of March 31, 2024), was lower than the EU27 average of 83.9% for 2023 (Source:
ComReg and Ampere Analysis), and we therefore continue to see an opportunity for growth in this area. The
mobile market is comprised of three mobile network operators (“MNOs”): eir, Three and Vodafone. There are
also a number of Mobile Virtual Network Operators (“MVNOs”) currently active in the market, which together
account for approximately 13% of total market (including mobile broadband and excluding Machine to Machine
(“M2M”)). Our mobile market share was 23.3% for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared to 22.0% for
the quarter ended March 31, 2023 (Source: ComReg 24/44). Data usage and bandwidth consumption have been
increasing rapidly in recent years, driven by the adoption of fiber-based fixed line services and 4G and 5G network
infrastructure to deliver high quality fast access to data anytime, anywhere. As a single-country focused operator,
we are the only operator in Ireland that wholly owns the material infrastructure underlying each of our four
services (fixed voice, high speed fixed broadband, mobile and Internet Protocol television (“IPTV”)).

The Irish telecommunications market also offers a stable regulatory environment in which to operate,

with regulation within Ireland being consistent with the EU. Under the current framework for the regulation of
wholesale broadband markets, recently announced in January 2024, we are allowed certain pricing flexibility to
set wholesale FTTP broadband prices, and can offer discounted prices for wholesale FTTP broadband services


-----

with pre-approval from ComReg. We maintain a regular dialogue with ComReg, and we believe there is increased
scope for deregulation, given the commitment by ComReg to annually review the market. We are hopeful that the
regulatory environment evolves to offer higher visibility for continued development of an infrastructure-based
telecommunications business, and greater focus on promoting investments in infrastructure and leading
technologies.

**_We are the leading fully converged quad-play telecom operator focused in Ireland with continued increase in_**
**_market share in mobile and broadband B2C_**

We are the sole telecommunications provider in Ireland that offers quad-play bundles on an integrated

network, and we offer a range of retail and wholesale services. We are the principal provider of fixed line
telecommunications and third largest mobile telecommunications providers in Ireland.

We are a fully converged telecommunications operator, offering a suite of fixed line and mobile services,

including high-speed broadband, TV, voice, and mobile services, to a diversified group of retail, business and
public sector customers. Our bundling strategy continues to deliver positive results and, as of March 31, 2024,
52% of our fixed base were double, triple or quad-play customers (compared to 46% for the same period in 2023)
(Source: Q1 FY24 Results).

Our fixed line division provides high-speed broadband, voice and data services to individual consumers,

business users and to wholesale customers. The fixed line division contributed 72% of our revenue (before intersegment eliminations) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. We have an extensive fixed line
telecommunications network in Ireland in terms of both capacity and geographic reach. According to quarterly
data published by ComReg (ComReg 22/44), we had a market share for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 of
37.9% of the Irish retail and wholesale fixed line market, based on revenue.

Broadband B2C

We are the leading retail broadband provider in a highly competitive market, with 27.9% market share

based on fixed broadband subscriptions as of March 31, 2024, achieving 0.2% growth from 27.7% market share
as of March 31, 2023 (Source: ComReg 24/44). We are followed by Virgin Media with 22.2% as of March 31,
2024, who lost 1.5% market share in the last year, notwithstanding that the market has been fully liberalized since
1998 and infrastructure competition has developed and intensified in the last five years.

Our broad service offering means that we can take advantage of the growth opportunity in the converging

telecommunications and media markets with support from customer demand for high-speed data services and high
quality content anytime, anywhere, on any device.

In line with the fixed broadband market, the Irish mobile telecommunication market has continued to grow.

According to ComReg, the Irish mobile market reported total mobile subscriptions of approximately 9.85 million
as of March 31, 2024, representing an increase of 8.7% since March 31, 2023. The penetration rate of mobile
subscriptions, calculated based on number of active SIM cards per 100 population, was 115.4% (including MBB
and excluding M2M) and 108.2% (excluding MBB and M2M), as of March 31, 2024. Our leading mobile offering
has delivered the #1 market position for 5G availability (73%) (Source: Network intelligence provider) with high
customer satisfaction (35.8 NPS Score), supporting us to further grow during the last year by gaining 1.3% of
mobile market share (including MBB and excluding M2M), as of March 31, 2024 (Source: ComReg 24/44).

Mobile B2C

Our mobile division provides standalone mobile services to consumer and business customers and is also

included as part of our bundled offerings. The mobile business contributed 28% of our total revenue (before intersegment eliminations) for the financial year ended December 31, 2023. We are a leader in the postpaid market in
Ireland, with a market share of 40.2% for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, increasing from 38.1% for the quarter
ended March 31, 2023, followed by Vodafone and Three, that both lost market share during the same time period
(Vodafone went from 31.8% to 30% and Three went from 15.6% to 16.1%). Additionally, we have now reached
Three in the second place in total consumer mobile market, each capturing a 26.5% share for the quarter ended
March 31, 2024, with eir demonstrating good momentum as it grew by 1.5 percentage points from the quarter
ended March 31, 2023 when it captured 25% of the market, while Three lost some market share during the same
time period (Three had 27% of the market for the quarter ended March 31, 2023; Vodafone leads the total mobile
consumer market with 30.2% for the quarter ended March 2023). (Source: ComReg 24/44).

Targeted fixed and mobile investments


-----

We are focused on convergence and long-term customer lifetime value, and our strategy is to connect

everyone and everything in Ireland, whether by high-speed broadband, voice, mobile data, or enterprise
datacomms. This strategy is underpinned by a major capital investment program which has facilitated the
transformation of our business. Our vision for our customers is a converged future with seamless access to fixed
and mobile services. Through Fibre Networks Ireland (FNI), our fiber JV with InfraVia Capital Partners
(“InfraVia”), we are currently well underway to completing our FTTH roll-out to 1.9 million premises (with nearly
two-thirds complete) across urban and suburban Ireland by late 2026 or early 2027, while also continuing to invest
in the upgrade and expansion of our mobile network with a view to significantly increasing our high-speed mobile
data capabilities, rolling out Ireland’s largest 5G network and expanding 4G coverage to 99% of the outdoor
geography of Ireland.

Our broad service offering means that we can take advantage of the growth opportunity in the converging

telecommunications and media markets with support from customer demand for high-speed data services and
high-quality content anytime, anywhere, on any device. We have been consistently increasing our FMC converged
household base which has increased to 47% as of March 31, 2024 compared to 41% as of March 31, 2023. We
believe there is significant potential for cross-selling and up-selling our fixed line voice, broadband, mobile and
TV services, which will increase RGU’s per household and result in lower churn in our subscriber base over time.
We believe our leading position in bundled services is further supported by the large fixed and mobile investments
we have made in our network infrastructures over time, making us the only provider with full ownership of
network infrastructures in Ireland in both fixed line and mobile services today.

**_We have a market leading business division with a comprehensive offering_**

We put a lot of emphasis in strengthening our B2B offering. The acquisition of Evros, Ireland’s best-in
class IT services provider, in January 2021, was a transformational move to create the number one leading ICT
franchise in Ireland. Through this acquisition, we enhanced our existing portfolio of enterprise communication
services, by adding capabilities in cyber security, communications, cloud and managed services. As a result, our
B2B positioning and ICT offering is now complemented by a comprehensive product suite that enables us to meet
the needs of businesses across multiple industries, with increasing embeddedness facilitating cross-selling and
upselling across the client base, driving 15% revenue growth in 2023. We have also received a number of
independent awards from major hardware and software providers in Ireland which highlight the strength of our
offering.

**_We are a leader in fixed wholesale, with an extensive national network_**

We have an extensive fiber network in Ireland, having installed 13,500 kilometers of fiber in 8,000

kilometers of sub-duct using our existing ducts to support our NGA network, and passed 1.22 million premises as
of March 31, 2024 or approximately 64% of the total passed with NGA, as well as an extensive copper
infrastructure supplementing our network.

Fibre to the Premises (FTTP) network in Ireland

As of March 31, 2024, we had reported approximately 1.21 million FTTP broadband lines, followed by

SIRO with approximately 567,000 lines, Virgin Media Ireland with approximately 281,000 lines and NBI with
approximately 233,000 lines (Source: ComReg 24/44).

In the wholesale market, we provide a broad range of infrastructure and managed services such as

wholesale line rental, bitstream, line share, LLU, capacity-based products and interconnect services. We provide
the capability for other operators to provide retail services to customers, as well as high capacity backhaul services
for MNOs to connect their radio sites.

Our wholesale division operates on a non-discriminatory basis, offering a range of regulated services

(including fiber) on “open access” basis, meaning it is available to other operators in the market on an equivalent
basis to our retail division, which drives the most efficient utilization of the asset and provides us with additional
revenue opportunities.

The majority of operators, including Vodafone, BT, Three, and Sky, are significant customers of our

wholesale business and specifically our core and access networks for the provision of mobile backhaul services
as well as services to their end user consumer and business customers, particularly given our unmatched network
coverage in approximately two thirds of the country. Consequently, we often gain some wholesale business if we
lose retail or business customers to OAOs.


-----

**_We have a well-invested national fixed network, with FTTH roll-out targeted to be completed by 2027, and_**
**_top-tier mobile network_**

We believe our leading converged position is supported by the large fixed and mobile investments we

have made in our network infrastructures over time, helping us maintain the full ownership of network
infrastructures in both fixed line and mobile services. We continue to invest significantly including the roll-out of
our FTTH network, the roll-out of our 5G network and IT transformation, as well as investments in spectrum.
These substantial investments have resulted in an extensive fiber network infrastructure in Ireland, delivering the
next generation of broadband data services and a mobile network that achieves an estimated 73% outdoor
population coverage for 5G and 99% for 4G.

Fixed Network

We have constructed an extensive FTTH fiber network, having completed approximately 1.2 million

FTTH homes passed as of March 31, 2024 with the intention to reach a total of 1.9 million homes passed by 2027.
The total budget to reach 1.9 million FTTH homes passed is approximately €1 billion, of which approximately
€500 million was spent to complete the first 1 million FTTH homes passed. As of March 31, 2024, we had passed
approximately 0.9 million premises with Fiber to the Cabinet (“FTTC”) technology (Source: Q1 2024 company
report), which offers broadband speeds of up to 100 Mb/s with the aid of vectoring technology. We are also
completing the roll-out of high-speed broadband to more than, using predominantly FTTH technology, and, as of
March 31, 2024, we had passed approximately 330,000 premises in rural areas bringing the total of FTTH
premises to approximately 1.2 million. As of March 31, 2024, approximately 880,000, or 42%, of our broadband
customers signed up to our NGA fiber services, compared to approximately 840,000, or 42%, as of March 31,
2023. We are also the controlling and operating shareholder of FNI, a Fiber joint venture with InfraVia that was
completed in June 2022 with the aim to accelerate the roll-out of ultrafast FTTH broadband across Ireland. In this
joint venture we own a 50.01% stake and we are providing our existing fiber and copper network, while InfraVia
joined as a financial partner providing approximately €0.6 billion to fund the rollout of fiber to 1.9 million homes.

We believe the reach and quality of our network allows us to offer highly attractive and competitive

services in terms of speed, capacity, content, connection reliability and cost efficiency. Our state-of-the-art
network has enabled us to launch a range of entertainment services on fiber, including TV services.

Mobile Network

We have a nationwide radio access base station network with approximately 2,600 mast sites. This

network has undergone a full transformation since 2019, upgrading existing sites while developing approximately
700 new sites throughout Ireland. This network is a fully independent radio access network (“RAN”) with no
sharing dependencies with other operators.

In the 2012 multiband spectrum auction, we acquired 2x10MHz in the 800MHz and 900MHz bands and

2×15MHz in the 1800MHz band. The acquired multiband license is valid until 2030. In the 2017 3.6 GH/z
spectrum auction, we acquired 85MHz in the main urban centers and 80 MHz in the rural regions. The 3.6 GHz
band has been extensively utilized to deliver 5G services throughout Ireland, now extending to 600 cities, towns
and villages throughout Ireland. These spectrum rights run for fifteen years, expiring on July 31, 2032.

In the 2022 multiband spectrum auction, we acquired 2 x 10Mhz in the 700Mhz band, 2 x 20Mhz in the

2100Mhz band and 60Mhz in the 2300Mhz TDD band. The spectrum rights in the 2022 multiband auction run to
2042 and were extensively deployed across the eir mobile network to increase network capacity and data speeds
in 2023.

The continued investment in the eir mobile network has resulted in a multi-award winning network

achievement from Ookla and Opensignal, and eir has consistently achieved Best 5G Network Availability since
the original 5G launch in 2019, as rated by a network intelligence provider. Additionally, eir has achieved the
highest 5G availability in Ireland with 73%, ahead of its competitors such as Three and Vodafone, whose 5G
availability stands at 58% and 51%, respectively (Source: Network intelligence provider).

**_We have a continued strong track record of operational efficiency, with transformational IT program expected_**
**_to be completed in 2025_**

Our IT transformation program focuses on simplifying and improving our billing accuracy, enhancing

automation, and reducing sales time. At the same time, we are making significant improvements to our customer
experience processes and operations as well as data management systems and system availability for our stores
and customer operations. As part of this initiative, we will soon be retiring our legacy IT systems.


-----

Our management and our principal shareholder, NJJ, are focused on our cost structure and, leveraging

their combined experience, we have embarked on a group-wide efficiency and simplification plan to make eir one
of the most efficient telecommunications operators in Europe. As a result of our disciplined cost management
plan, during the last five years, we managed to reduce operating expenses from 36.9% of revenues, to 30.8% of
revenues, resulting in a 15% reduction of the total operating costs, driving continued EBITDA margin growth.

As a result of this process, we have been able to better allocate our resources which has enabled us to

increase our profit margin, with further upside potential for operational efficiencies.

**_We have strong financial momentum with top line growth, and growing best-in-class EBITDA margin, superior_**
**_cash conversion and strong de-leveraging track record_**

Our business is strongly cash generative, with growth in revenue of approximately 5% in the twelve

months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 (8[th] consecutive quarter),
and with an Adjusted EBITDA of €639 million and €636 million for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024
and March 31, 2023 respectively. We have continued to generate significant cash flows in the face of competitive
pressures by having an increased focus on relevant bundles, improving operational efficiencies and reducing costs
through our efficiency program. We generated adjusted net operating cash flows of €384 million and €243 million
for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 and the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 respectively. Our
Adjusted EBITDA margin of 49% compares favorably to the average of select Western European
telecommunications operators of 37% (based on KPN, Swisscom, BT and Proximus (Source: company filings)).

As a result of our significant investments to date, we have a well-invested fixed and mobile network. As

such, our recently commenced investment plans are largely discretionary (approximately €497 million in fixed
and €167 million in mobile infrastructure over the next three years) and can be scaled back if necessary. We are
currently in the peak funding phase of our FTTH roll-out to 1.9 million premises (with nearly two-thirds
complete), which is expected to be largely completed by 2027. As we complete our FTTH roll-out, we expect
future associated network maintenance cost and capital expenditure requirements to be meaningfully lower
compared to traditional legacy copper networks. Together, this further reinforces our objective to deliver an
attractive cash flow profile and a strong operational deleveraging trajectory as previously demonstrated.

**_We have an experienced management team, supported by sophisticated and disciplined shareholders with_**
**_unique telecoms experience_**

Our management team combines extensive experience from operating in both the Irish and international

telecommunications markets as well as in global consumer brands. Our Chief Executive Officer, Oliver Looms,
was appointed CEO in February 2022 and brings a wealth of experience in consumer brands, having spent 22
years at Diageo Ireland where he also held the CEO position. Our Chief Financial Officer, Stephen Tighe, joined
in 2003 and was appointed CFO in April 2018, and has over 20 years of experience. He has grown through the
organization, holding a number of key finance positions including Finance Director for consumer as well as our
wholesale businesses. Our new Chief Technology Officer, Fergal McCann, was appointed CTO of eir in April
2024. Mr. McCann was Director of Mobile & Core Networks from 2015 to 2024 at eir and led the Mobile Network
transformation program during this time. Our CFO and CTO, as well as many other key individuals within the
organization, have been promoted from within and have in-depth knowledge of the company having held a variety
of roles prior to taking on more senior positions.

Our management team has demonstrated its skill and delivery capability in the critical areas of cost

reduction, increasing efficiencies, increasing market position, rolling out infrastructures and commercial offerings
such as FTTH and 5G, as well as working effectively with key stakeholders, including ComReg. Our management
team also has sophisticated commercial and financial expertise gained through completing numerous complex
transactions.

NJJ is a supportive and highly involved shareholder, with significant experience in telecommunications

and a track record of successfully operating other telecommunication companies. NJJ has a track record in
acquiring, transforming and operating telecom operators, with a presence in several European countries (such as
Ireland, Switzerland, Monaco, Cyprus and Malta) and an announced acquisition in Ukraine. NJJ reviews and
drives our strategy and communicates on a weekly basis with our management team to further refine our strategic
objectives. Our costs, expenses and capital expenditures are reviewed on a continuous basis together with NJJ.

**Our Strategy**

Connecting is our core business. We are responding to the growing customer demand for continuous fast

and reliable accessibility, whether for high-speed broadband, calls, TV or mobile services, by further investing in
our fixed and mobile infrastructure, the foundation on which our services are based. Bundling and convergence


-----

are core to our strategy. Coupled with a best-in-class fixed and mobile infrastructure, we continue to drive our
successful transformation from a telephony company to a converged telecommunications company where our
customers increasingly subscribe to multiple products within our offering.

Our goal is to create value by maintaining our market leadership in the fixed line market and expanding

our presence in the mobile market, while maximizing operational efficiencies and adhering to strict cost discipline.
We are leveraging our extensive fixed and mobile reach and making significant investments in our networks to
provide our retail, business and wholesale customers with a full range of standalone and bundled
telecommunications services.

The key elements of our strategy are:

**_Continue to invest in our next generation fixed and mobile networks with continued roll-out of future-proof_**
**_new technologies_**

Our NGA fiber network currently passes 2.1 million premises, representing approximately 93% of

premises in Ireland as of March 31, 2024, and our copper network infrastructure covers the substantial remainder.
We are making additional investments to our fixed network to further support our superior offering compared to
our competition, by investing in a multi-year program to roll-out our 1 Gb/s FTTH network to approximately 1.2
million premises. The roll-out of our fiber network is being supported and accelerated by the creation in 2022 of
a dedicated fiber company, in partnership with experienced infrastructure firm InfraVia, focused on the
deployment of FTTH across Ireland with access to infrastructure financing.

We expect that such investment will let us:

##### • further capture the opportunities presented by bundling to increase RGUs per customer and maximize
customer lifetime value, by extending the reach and penetration of our triple- and quad-play services
(which include TV services);

##### • maintain high levels of customer service and strong brand recognition to secure customer loyalty;
focusing on retaining and winning back customers through re-contracting activities, bundled services
offerings, and improved marketing campaigns that defend and retain existing customer relationships and
revenue by reducing churn and developing new services to meet the needs of our customers; and

##### • highlight the affordability, capacity, quality and reliability of fixed line services and the benefits they
bring to homes and businesses.

In March 2024, we completed our €250 million investment plan to transform our mobile network,

significantly enhancing mobile voice and high-speed data experiences across Ireland. Our nationwide mobile
infrastructure now provides 5G service in over 600 towns and cities and delivers over 99% 4G outdoor population
coverage. We plan to continue investing in our mobile network in the coming years to further enhance the
experience for our customers:

##### • rolling out Ireland’s largest 5G network to enable ultra-high speed mobile data;

 • expanding our 4G and 5G services to support data traffic growth through development of new capacity
sites in urban areas;

##### • expanding our rural 4G and 5G service through development of new coverage sites throughout Ireland;
and

##### • infill 5G services to continue our 5G market leadership.

Our network investment has supported and will continue to support the exponential growth in data traffic,

and our investments in NGA fiber broadband will continue to provide our wholesale business with a platform for
the provision of backhaul services to a number of mobile operators. We are focused on enhancing capacity and
coverage of our network at reduced costs, with the ambition to generate higher returns while delivering a
differentiated service for our customers and to be the first network of choice for all.

**_Offer high quality, high value bundles, focusing on a more-for-more strategy_**

We will continue to leverage our strong position in the retail market, as the only quad-play operator with

wholly-owned fixed and mobile network infrastructure, to offer high quality and value bundles to our customers,
in order to drive higher ARPU and lower churn. We will do this by:


-----

##### • continuing to improve our bundled offerings, leveraging our leading proprietary infrastructure across
fixed voice and broadband, TV and mobile;

##### • further simplifying our product offering, so that our value proposition is clearer to our customers;

 • leveraging our content offering as a key differentiating factor, and in particular the eir Sport package;

 • executing our €250 million mobile network investment program, which includes the continued roll-out
of 5G technology to allow ultra-high speed mobile data and to make eir the best mobile network in
Ireland; and

##### • focusing on the postpaid subscriber base to increase the uptake of triple- and quad-play bundles.

**_Deliver a best-in-class customer experience, enhancing our brand identity_**

We intend to drive revenue growth by focusing on our customers and their experience. We plan on doing

this by:

##### • revitalizing our customer experience through in-sourcing of key customer facing functions, including
sales, customer services, retail stores, collections as well as HR, IT and other central functions.

##### • simplifying and improving our bundled offering (we have already reduced the product combinations
available to our customers dramatically during 2018), making it easier for our customers to select our
product offering, whilst our sales staff can more efficiently identify the most suitable packages;

##### • aiming to have the best quality network infrastructure in Ireland, supported by our future-proofing
investment program;

##### • re-designing our IT stack to enable us to better understand our customers, promote relevant key products
and offer high quality customer support; and

##### • rebuilding our systems and processes to be digital first, while leveraging data and new technology to
enhance consumer experience and service offerings, and innovating in a manner that is informed and
driven by our customers’ needs, as demonstrated through our market-leading products GoMo, eir TV
and the introduction of eir evo, the first B2B full service ICT solutions provider in Ireland.

We are continuing to train and upskill our employees and ensure that we have a purpose-built IT stack

that equips and enables them with the appropriate information and tools to offer superior service to our customers.
We believe this continued focus and investment on customer experience is beneficial to customers. Once fully
implemented, it will improve customer satisfaction, strengthen our brand, reduce churn and generate higher ARPU
through more relevant targeted product offerings and ultimately revenue growth.

**_Continue strengthening our leading wholesale position, and capitalize on B2B opportunities through eir_**
**_Business_**

We will continue to leverage the strength of our core and access networks and develop our growing

mobile network to further increase our wholesale and B2B revenues. We plan on doing this by:

##### • retaining and growing our share of Ireland’s growing broadband market through our retail offering, as
well as our wholesale access to OAOs in situations where we are unable to maintain the retail customer
relationship ourselves. In many parts of Ireland, eir is the sole infrastructure provider to access fixed
connectivity. Ireland’s fixed broadband market has grown from 1,576,973 subscribers as of December
31, 2021, to 1,661,534 subscribers as of March 31, 2024 (Sources: ComReg 22/19 and ComReg 24/44),
while our share of the retail market has remained stable at approximately 27.9% (Sources: ComReg
22/19 and ComReg 24/44);

##### • utilizing our leading core fiber network to provide mobile backhaul services to ourselves and to other
MNOs on commercial terms;

##### • bidding on specific complementary projects;

 • continuing to transition our B2B offering away from reliance on legacy access and voice, to data, mobile
and services in order to offset structural declines in legacy products;


-----

##### • targeting all B2B segments with next generation voice, data and video solutions with a simplified product
offering; and

##### • leveraging fixed line business customer relationships to cross-sell mobile services. We believe there is
opportunity to accelerate growth in our mobile B2B subscriber base by combining our existing
relationships with business with an upgraded mobile network. Mobile network coverage is an important
consideration for Irish businesses when choosing a MNO and historically our network coverage has
trailed Vodafone for geographical coverage, a situation which we believe will reverse following our
mobile investment plan.

**_Have an ongoing focus on cost control through IT transformation, simplification and process improvement_**

We will continue focusing on our cost transformation program to meet our ambition of making eir “best
in-class” in the European telecom sector. We want to create a more agile company that can better respond to
customer demands and expectations. We believe this can be achieved through simplification and digitalization of
our business, operations and processes, which in turn will enable faster decision-making and better
communication, without compromising our ambitions to be a leader in customer experience.

We are implementing a simplification program in phases and to date we have already made significant

progress on three key pillars:

##### • Product streamlining: we have meaningfully reduced the number of products offered and will maintain
a lean product offering, resulting in simplification for many parts of our organization and we will
continue offering exciting new propositions to our customers at competitive pricing;

##### • Investing in and rebuilding our IT stack: we have identified and will retire many of our legacy IT systems,
designing and building a new customized IT stack, removing redundant applications and generating
meaningful savings; and

##### • Process simplification: we will continue to review our organization structure and processes on an ongoing
basis to identify further simplification opportunities.

In addition, our focus on our efficient cost structure will generate additional savings, as we continue to

negotiate vendor contracts through a comprehensive review of all existing agreements, and in some instances look
to create multi-vendor support agreements.

**_Maintain financial discipline and deliver sustainable growth, creating an attractive cash flow and deleveraging_**
**_profile_**

The management and our shareholders are focused on making our company “best-in-class” and future
proofing our fixed and mobile infrastructure by continuing our investments over the next few years. We aim to
continually improve cash flow organically and by implementing our efficiency and simplification program and,
among other initiatives, pursuing smart growth opportunities available to us in a manner that generates high
incremental return on both our capital and commercial investments to drive increased EBITDA. Our key priorities
are to develop our growth areas, improve customer service and increase revenues, while focusing on process
simplification, cost efficiency and achieving operationally driven deleveraging in the medium term through
growth in EBITDA.

presented herein includes the results of our joint venture in Tetra on a proportionate consolidation basis to March
23, 2022.

We present our results of operations and cash flows for the financial year ended December 31, 2022 on

an adjusted basis, applying the proportionate method of accounting rather than the equity method of accounting
in reflecting Tetra’s results in our consolidated financial statements as we believe presenting Tetra’s contribution
on a line by line basis provides a more meaningful view of our results of operations. In accordance with IFRS 11
‘Joint Arrangements’, the EHIL consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended December 31, 2022
apply the equity method of accounting to Tetra’s results. See also “Presentation of Financial Data.”

The unaudited _pro forma financial information gives effect to the Transactions as though they had_

occurred on March 31, 2024 for the purposes of balance sheet data and as of April 1, 2023 for the purposes of
income statement data. The unaudited pro forma data is provided for illustrative purposes only and do not purport
to represent what our actual results of operations or financial position would have been if the Transactions had
occurred, in the case of debt metrics, on March 31, 2024 or, in case of interest expense, on April 1, 2023. The
unaudited pro forma data set out in this Offering Memorandum is based upon available information and certain
assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable.

This summary should be read in conjunction with the information contained in “Presentation of

_Financial Data,” “Selected Historical Financial Data,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial_
_Condition and Results of Operations” and our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this_
Offering Memorandum. Investors are advised to read this Offering Memorandum in its entirety and not rely on
the summarized information only.

(12) We define EBITDA as (loss) or profit for the period before income tax charge (or credit), net finance costs,
depreciation of property, plant and equipment, depreciation of right of use assets, and amortization. We
define Adjusted EBITDA (excluding impact of IFRS 15 and 16) as Adjusted EBITDA adjusted to exclude
the impact of IFRS 15 and IFRS 16. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for non-cash
pension charge, non-cash lease contracts, management charge, exceptional items, impairment of right of
use assets and profit on disposal of property, plant and equipment. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is defined
as Adjusted EBITDA (excluding impact of IFRS 15 and IFRS 16) divided by revenue. We believe
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margin provide useful information to management
and investors with respect to our overall operating performance by facilitating comparisons of operating
performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of items not directly resulting from core
operations. See “Presentation of Financial Data.”

(a) For the financial year ended December 31, 2022, our EBITDA includes EBITDA attributable to Tetra for the period from

January 1, to March 23, 2022. Our 56% proportionate share of Tetra’s EBITDA was €2 million for the financial year ended December 31,
2022.

(b) The non-cash pension charge represents the difference between the amount of cash contributions that we have agreed to

make to the fund during the period, on an accruals basis, and the accounting charges recognized in the income statement in accordance with
IAS 19 (Revised). As a result, non-cash pension charge is included as an adjustment to our EBITDA.

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes to be issued in this offering involves a high degree of risk. Before making an_

_investment decision with respect to the Notes, you should carefully consider the risks described below, in addition_
_to the other information contained in this Offering Memorandum. These risks are not the only ones we face._
_Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently believe are immaterial, may_
_also impair our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any of the possible events described_
_below were to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely_
_affected. If that happens, we may not be able to pay interest or principal on the Notes when due and you could_
_lose all or part of your investment._

**Risks Related to Our Business and Industry**

**_We are dependent on Ireland for substantially all of our revenue and our business would be negatively_**
**_impacted if the Irish economy were to falter or if general economic conditions deteriorate._**

We generate virtually all of our revenue in Ireland, where substantially all of our customers are located.

Demand for our products and services is influenced by a number of factors, including the strength of the Irish
economy. While the Irish economy has been rebounding from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, our business
and results of operations could potentially be impacted by an economic downturn. If the Irish economy were to
falter, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the
impact on telecommunications spending due to higher unemployment, emigration, tax increases and declines in
overall consumer and business spending.

A global economic downturn that impacts Ireland may adversely affect our services, as fewer clients may

have the ability to subscribe to our services. In the past two years, the outbreak of the war in Ukraine in February
2022, global supply chain disruptions and other geopolitical conflicts, such as conflict between Israel and Hamas,
have caused an immediate impact on global economic conditions, which has led to increased inflationary pressure
in 2022, 2023 and the first half of 2024, including causing increases in the price for goods and services, which has
resulted and may continue to result in shortages in materials and services. Such shortages have resulted and may
continue to result in inflationary cost increases for labor, fuel, materials and services, and could continue to cause
costs to increase in the near term. Although we do not have direct economic activities in Russia and Ukraine and
currently the conflict has not had any material impact on our overall sales and EBITDA, it is difficult to predict
the scope and extent of any potential impact of the increasing tensions and other geopolitical conflicts could have
on our operations. Moreover, supply shortages in gas and other raw materials are significantly impacting many
industries and sectors, which could result in increases to the overall price of goods and services, and may, in turn,
impact our results of operations as our customers may seek to scale back on their expenditures. Continuing high
inflation could impact the overall demand for and costs of our services and the margins we are able to realize on
our services, all of which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. Inflation has also resulted in a rise of interest rates to the highest levels seen in years and central banks
around the world may keep rising interest rates further or keeping them at the current high levels, which in turn
would result in higher interests we incur on our borrowings. There remains considerable uncertainty over the longterm effects of the above factors and the monetary and fiscal policies which have been adopted by the central
banks and financial authorities of some of the world’s leading economies.

We cannot predict the long-term effects such factors may have on the global political and economic

conditions, including whether they may result in a severe or prolonged global economic recession. These
unfavorable economic conditions may impact a significant number of subscribers, and, as a result, it may, among
other things, be more (i) difficult for us to attract new subscribers, (ii) likely that subscribers will downgrade or
disconnect their services and (iii) difficult for us to maintain ARPUs at existing levels. Accordingly, our ability
to increase, or, in certain cases, maintain, the revenue, ARPUs, operating cash flow, operating cash flow margins
and liquidity of our business could be adversely affected if the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain or
declines further. We are currently unable to predict the extent of any of these potential adverse effects. We are
also subject to increasing operating costs, mainly relating to network expansion, deployment and energy. Although
we generally attempt to reduce the impact of such costs by being more cost-efficient, there is no assurance that
we will be able to do so due to competitive and other factors. Operating costs may rise faster than associated
revenue or our costs-efficiency initiatives, resulting in a material negative impact on our cash flow and results of
operations. We are also affected by inflationary increases in salaries, wages, benefits and other administrative
costs which we may not be in a position to offset effectively, which in turn could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In order to effectively offset the foregoing, we may
need to increase our prices, which could increase our churn or impact our competitive position in the market. Any
of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of


-----

operations.

**_Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by continued fixed-to-_**
**_mobile substitution as well as the substitution by non-traditional voice and data services providers._**

The Irish fixed line telecommunications market has been, and will continue to be, influenced by fixed-to
mobile substitution (i.e., using mobile networks to handle traffic that traditionally would be handled on a fixed
network), convergence (i.e., using any device anywhere to access services, such as VoWifi that allows customers
to access voice service on wi-fi networks using a smartphone) and service evolution (e.g., VoBB that allows
customers to access traditional voice services through a single data connection which is also used for broadband),
the strength of which trends is increasing due to higher smartphone penetration, competition from traditional and
non-traditional service providers and changing customer preferences. These trends have affected the
telecommunications industry globally, and in particular voice services. As fixed line subscribers place more calls
from their mobile phones, retail voice traffic has declined. In addition, some subscribers are choosing to forego
having an access line installed in favor of using a mobile phone. The availability of higher capability mobile
broadband, including improved services that are facilitated by 4G and 5G technologies, are factors that may
contribute to further fixed-to-mobile substitution, convergence and service evolution, although we believe that
continued growth in data loads will have a favorable impact on demand for fixed broadband services. To the extent
we are unable to offset decreases in fixed line service revenue resulting from these trends with increased mobile
revenue, our business will be adversely affected.

Substitution from non-traditional fixed and mobile voice and data services, in particular OTT applications,

such as Skype, Apple iMessage and Facetime, Google Talk, WhatsApp, WeChat and Facebook, is likely to
continue to adversely affect our business. These OTT applications are often free of charge, accessible via
smartphones and smart devices that allow their users access to potentially unlimited messaging and voice services
over the Internet, using small portions of their data allowance and thus avoiding more expensive traditional voice
and messaging services (SMS/MMS) provided by traditional operators such as eir. A further advantage of OTT,
or other cloud-based services, is that they allow easier migration from one device to another, or one carrier to
another, when compared with traditional voice and messaging services, while retaining past messaging data. This
appears to be an increasing differentiator in a market where the lifetime of a device is ever decreasing. With the
growing proportion of smartphones in the mobile subscriber base in Ireland and the increasing adoption of smart
devices such as tablets, an increasing number of fixed and mobile customers are using OTT services. All MNOs
are currently competing with OTT service providers who leverage existing infrastructures and are often not
required to implement the capital-intensive business models associated with traditional fixed line operators and
MNOs like eir. OTT service providers have become increasingly sophisticated, and technological developments
have led to a significant improvement in the quality of service, particularly in speech quality. Moreover, players
with strong brand recognition and substantial financial resources, such as Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft,
are expected to continue to grow their OTT services.

**_We face competition in the Irish mobile telecommunications market, which may adversely affect our business,_**
**_financial condition and results of operations._**

There are currently three main MNOs in the Irish mobile telecommunications market: eir, Vodafone and

Three. Respective mobile subscribers market shares (including mobile broadband and excluding M2M) for the
three months ended March 31, 2024 were 23.3%, 34.3% and 29.4%. In addition, there are smaller MVNOs,
including Tesco Mobile, Virgin Mobile and a number of others, with a combined mobile subscribers market share
of 13%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024, that deliver their services over networks provided by the
MNOs. Competition for customers among all of these operators is based principally upon the services and features
offered, the technical quality of the mobile network and its coverage, customer service, capacity, and price, with
the introduction of a growing number of packages bundling minutes, SMS and data.

Competition in the market continues to put pressure on market revenue in both the postpay and prepay

segments. As of March 31, 2024, 22% of our mobile handset customer base consisted of prepay users. The churn
of prepaid customers is significantly higher than that of postpaid customers and prepaid customers also have a
lower ARPU than postpaid customers.

We expect that in the near to medium term the total number of subscribers in the Irish mobile

telecommunications market will level off, and market growth will be driven largely by new services such as B2B
mobile services, the Internet of Things (“IoT”) and the “Connected Society,” bundled offerings and content.
Accordingly, our ability to maintain our mobile revenue and defend and grow our subscriber base will depend in


-----

part upon our ability to retain existing customers by offering attractive bundles and new offerings which increase
the ARPU and the lifetime value of the customer, our ability to induce our customers to switch from prepaid to
postpaid plans, our ability to stimulate demand for new services, and our success in convincing mobile users to
switch from competing operators to our mobile or converged services. To grow further, it will also be necessary
for us to compete in the IoT and the Connected Society spaces.

If we are not able to compete effectively with other MNOs and MVNOs, our business, financial condition

and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

**We face competition in the Irish fixed line telecommunications market, which may adversely affect our**
**business, financial condition and results of operations.**

Since the liberalization of the Irish fixed line telecommunications market, our overall retail fixed line

market share has declined as a result of competition from retail fixed line operators such as Vodafone, Virgin
Media and Sky. In addition, SIRO, a joint venture between the ESB, the incumbent power network company in
Ireland, and Vodafone is rolling out FTTB to selected urban and semi-urban areas using fiber attached to the
access infrastructure of the ESB. We also face competition from independent fixed wireless access providers that
service primarily rural areas which do not have access to high-speed fiber broadband. Our churn rates and margins
are impacted and will continue to be impacted by the levels of competition in the market in which operate. Our
competitors may also enter into network sharing agreements or consolidate and increase their network capabilities,
which could cause us to lose market share. If we are not able to compete effectively in the fixed line
communications market, our business, financial conditions and results of operations could be materially adversely
affected.

**We may not be able to successfully continue to implement our bundling strategy, which could have an**
**adverse impact on our results of operations.**

A significant component of our strategy is to continue to expand our bundled offerings, which comprise

fixed voice, broadband, TV (including sports content) and mobile services. We believe that bundling reduces
churn of fixed line subscribers, reduces the cost of retaining, billing and serving the subscriber base while
attracting new broadband subscribers, increases the number of RGUs per subscriber and increases ARPU. Our
ability to successfully continue to implement this strategy may, however, be adversely affected if demand for
broadband services, particularly high speed broadband services, does not continue to grow in Ireland as we expect
or if competition increases, whether as a result of the entry of new competitors or otherwise. In particular, other
operators may offer more competitively priced bundles than those offered by us. Our ability to offer bundles is
also dependent in part on the successful completion of our planned roll-out of fiber based access technologies to
facilitate higher broadband speeds. Technological developments such as new platforms for broadband or TV
access and/or distribution operational support systems and business support systems may also adversely affect the
competitiveness of our bundled offerings.

**We are increasingly dependent on revenue generated from data services and a failure to successfully**
**compete in data services could have an adverse effect on our fixed line business and results of operations.**

Our fixed line business is dependent on revenue generated from data services, particularly broadband

services, and end-to-end business solutions within our Business division to offset the impact of our results of
operations in the declining market for fixed line voice and access services and to maintain the long-term
profitability of the business. A number of factors could limit our ability to increase our revenue from data services,
including weak growth in customer demand for data services, difficulties or delays in the continued roll-out of
our NGA fiber network, limited customer adoption of more advanced and faster forms of broadband services,
increased price competition from other data service providers or a slow uptake of services rolled out in rural areas.

Revenue growth from data services must be balanced with appropriate pricing to maximize widespread

adoption by the greatest number of users and to encourage migration to higher-speed offerings. Our broadband
services are subject to competition from services provided by competitors using other technologies such as cable,
wireless or satellite, and from services built by competitors that are based on unbundled local loops, line share
and co-location. In addition, our fixed line business is facing increased competition in this market from mobile
companies following the deployment of 4G, which allows mobile operators to offer higher rate data services to
their customers via their mobile networks. Our lower share of the mobile market relative to our share of the fixed
line market makes us vulnerable to such competitive pressures.

We are attempting to address these challenges with a number of programs, such as by rolling out fiber
based NGA fixed line services, including FTTH, improving our 4G mobile network and deploying 5G, as well as
offering bundled telecommunications services which now include mobile services for our business customer


-----

segment. If these programs are not successful, however, we may not maintain or grow our broadband revenue,
which would materially adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.

**Our fixed line telecommunications services are subject to extensive regulation and regulatory initiatives,**
**and an evolution of an adverse regulatory framework could have a negative impact on our results of**
**operations.**

The fixed line telecommunications services that we provide are subject to extensive regulation. ComReg

regulates the manner in which we provide many of our retail and wholesale services and the prices at which they
are provided, and is mandated to pursue a policy of fostering increased competition in the Irish fixed line
telecommunications market while encouraging the deployment of high-speed broadband networks. In addition,
the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications (“Minister”) may, in the interests of proper and
effective regulation of the Irish fixed line telecommunications market, give policy directions to ComReg to be
followed in the exercise of its regulatory functions. In recent years, ComReg has taken a number of measures
designed to further increase competition. These initiatives include requiring eir to provide specified wholesale
services and unbundled network services to OAOs in order to allow these operators to compete in the retail market
and, more recently, measures seeking to facilitate and increase the use by other providers of our physical
infrastructure, such as ducts and poles, to allow the deployment of new network infrastructure. Provision of these
wholesale services to competitors has contributed to our loss of market share in the retail fixed line market, which
may continue, and would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

ComReg’s market analysis decision (D05/24) requires us to pre-notify retail offers and pre-notify

wholesale discounts and promotions. If ComReg do not approve such promotions and discounts, then this may
impair our ability to compete with retailers and/or wholesale service providers who are not restricted from offering
discounts, and may contribute to a loss of market share, which would negatively impact our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**We may be subject to increased competition in the broadband market as a result of Government initiatives**
**to promote broadband infrastructure investment including by our competitors, which may negatively**
**impact our results of operations.**

The Irish Government has taken a number of policy initiatives, including providing substantial funding, as

part of the National Development Plan (NPB) to promote investment in broadband infrastructure in Ireland.

National Broadband Ireland (NBI), which was appointed in 2019 to deliver the NBP following the approval

of the program by the European Commission under relevant State aid rules, is currently in the process of rolling
out an FTTH network within the NBP “Intervention Area” (“IA”). This involves an end-to-end delivery of a
reliable high speed wholesale open access broadband network that includes a major fiber build-out to rural areas.
In total, the IA comprises approximately 542,000 premises. In delivering the NBP, NBI makes extensive use of
our pole and duct infrastructure within the IA pursuant to a long-term Infrastructure Access Agreement between
NBI and eir.

The roll-out of the NBP by NBI has resulted in a lower utilization of our copper network within the IA,

as customers migrate to fiber broadband. We have, however, received significant additional rental income from
NBI for access to our pole and duct infrastructure which has mitigated these revenue losses to a considerable
extent and, in any event, we are in the process of decommissioning/retiring our legacy copper network. While our
retail divisions operate on the NBP network in the IA, we may not gain the same level of market share as we
currently have within the IA.

**If we are unable to maintain a favorable brand image or maintain a positive customer experience, we may**
**be unable to retain existing and/or attract new customers, leading to loss of market share and revenue.**

Our ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers depends in part on our ability to

maintain a favorable brand image and to ensure a good level of customer experience. The telecommunications
market is driven by, among other factors, customer satisfaction, which may be impacted by a variety of factors,
including customer’s perception of the overall package, price-value ratio of services, network quality, coverage,
functionality and speed and operator’s ability to solve customer problems in a fast and efficient way (customer
service). We track customer perception and experience, which helps guide our efforts to maintain and improve
the position of our brands in the market, including advertising, sponsorship, and ensuring that overall company
performance in terms of product portfolio, service provision and management is subject to regular review and
improvement initiatives. We also continuously aim to provide high levels of customer service, both in terms of
the customer experience when using our services and also in connection with handling complaints and solving
customer problems. A number of cost optimizing measures in customer care were taken under previous ownership


-----

and have since then been reversed, including having brought customer care back in-house to help improve our
customer service and our reputation in the market. If we are not successful in maintaining a favorable brand image,
or if brand promotions by our competitors prove more successful at attracting and retaining customers, and/or we
fail to improve customer satisfaction levels sufficiently (or we are ranked behind our competitors in satisfaction
studies), our ability to acquire new customers and increase our customer churn may be affected, which could have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**We may not achieve the return we anticipate in connection with the investments we have made in our**
**NGA network, our 4G network, our upcoming 5G network and other projects.**

We have undertaken a major program of capital expenditure to facilitate the transformation of our

business and enable us to respond to the technological and competitive challenges we face. Our capital expenditure
has mainly focused on the roll-out of our NGA network, investments in spectrum to roll-out 4G services,
investments in new IT capabilities and investments in TV (including content). In time, we expect significant
benefits to be realized as a result of these investments. In particular, the investments in our NGA, 4G and 5G
networks not only enable us to meet customers’ strong demand for high speed data, but are also a key component
of our bundling strategy, and investments in TV content will enable us to make our IPTV offering more attractive
and roll-out our TV everywhere initiative. We cannot be sure, however, that these investments will generate the
return we anticipate.

**The interest of InfraVia, as minority shareholder of Fibre Networks Ireland Limited may be inconsistent**
**with our interests.**

InfraVia’s role as a minority shareholder in FNI could, in certain circumstances, conflict with our interests.

Disagreements or differing viewpoints between majority and minority shareholders may lead to delays in decisionmaking or failures to reach consensus on significant matters, which could materially and adversely impact our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

**The telecommunications industry is subject to rapid changes in technology and our success depends on our**
**ability to effectively deploy new or enhanced technologies as well as make substantial investment across our**
**fixed and mobile networks, business systems and television content offerings.**

The technologies used in the telecommunications industry are rapidly evolving, and there can be no

assurance that we will be able to sufficiently and efficiently adapt the services we provide to keep pace with these
developments or be able to fund investments in current and new technologies required to remain competitive. In
particular, certain communications technologies, such as LTE and VoIP, and fiber optics technology allowing for
faster data transmission and lower unit cost per gigabyte of transferred traffic, are increasingly important in the
markets in which we operate. We expect that 5G services will also become an important technology in the coming
years. Due to the rapid evolution of technology, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to predict and
devote appropriate amounts of capital and resources to develop the necessary technologies to satisfy existing
subscribers and attract new subscribers or that we will recover the investments we have made in such technologies.
Furthermore, technological change and the emergence of alternative technologies for the provision of
telecommunications services that are technologically superior, cheaper or otherwise more attractive than those
that we provide may render our existing services less profitable, less viable or obsolete. Technological
developments may also shorten product life cycles and facilitate convergence of various segments in the
telecommunications industry. We cannot currently predict with certainty how emerging and future technological
changes will affect our operations, nor can we predict when new technologies required to support our planned
services will be available. If we are unable to keep pace with technological developments, or are unable to fund
our current and future capital programs, or if we are unable to realize the gains in revenues, market share and
profitability that we expect from our capital programs, our business, financial condition and results of operations
could be materially adversely affected.

**We depend upon the proper functioning of our IT network, billing and customer relation management**
**systems and must continuously upgrade these systems.**

Our business is dependent on the capacity and reliability of our IT network, billing and customer relationship

management (“CRM”) systems that support our operations. These systems can be expensive to upgrade or
maintain and are subject to performance degradation or failure for reasons outside our control. There can be no
assurance that new approaches or upgraded systems will perform as expected or will result in reduced spending
for us. Any disruption or failure of current, or new, systems on which we rely could have a material adverse effect
on our ability to deliver services to clients and may lead to direct or indirect financial losses and loss of clients.

In order to retain and expand our subscriber base, we must continue to maintain and upgrade our IT network,

billing and CRM systems in a timely manner. In particular, a number of business facilities, including our data


-----

center and IT systems, have limitations and a large number of customers remain on old, inflexible systems with
limited experienced staff to support and develop them. While our intention is that these facilities and systems will
be replaced as part of our IT transformation projects, there is a risk that our business will be unable to replace
certain facilities and/or systems without disruption to customers, on time, or within budget. In addition, the
complexity of our current IT systems may affect our ability to launch new services in a timely manner.

Moreover, requirements to upgrade network functionality, expand and maintain customer services, update

network management and administrative systems and upgrade older systems and networks to adapt them to new
technologies are not entirely under our control and may be affected in the future by, among other things,
applicable regulations.

Although we are actively working on projects that will transform our IT network, billing and CRM

systems, if we fail to successfully upgrade these systems or maintain the existing systems, our customer service
levels may suffer and we may lose existing subscribers to our competitors, or we may be required to make
unbudgeted investments. Any failure to avoid operational interruptions during the implementation of our upgraded
systems, or any failure to implement such new services, could disrupt our business and lead to liability towards
third parties. Any disruption or failure of current, or new, systems could have a material adverse effect on our
business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

**Our profitability may suffer if we are unable to successfully introduce new products or enter new market**
**segments or businesses.**

As part of our strategy, we seek to identify and exploit opportunities for future growth, including

introducing new products or entering into new market segments or into new telecommunications businesses. We
have also invested significantly in convergence, having launched VoWiFi as the first in the Irish market, launched
VoBB and VoLTE. Further developments will be needed in the future to maintain leadership as a converged
operator and we may need to invest substantial funds and other resources, or enter into strategic alliances or
partnerships in order to introduce new products or to enter and compete in these market segments or businesses.
In addition, to the extent we expand into new business lines, we will be faced with risks and challenges which
differ from those we have traditionally faced, and may be required to make further investments or enter further
partnerships, which we may not succeed in forging, to maintain our position in such new market segments or
businesses. We may not have the resources necessary for such investment or find suitable partners, nor can we be
sure that any market segments or businesses that we enter into in the future will perform as well as we might
expect.

**Strikes or other industrial actions could disrupt our operations or make it more costly to operate our**
**facilities.**

We have a well-developed collective bargaining relationship with our trade unions. The terms and

conditions for “graded employees” are the subject of collective bargaining agreements, primarily, but not
exclusively, negotiated through the Joint Conciliation Council, in which all of our recognized trade unions
participate.

These agreements provide for a dispute resolution process whereby we would utilize the services of the

Workplace Relations Commission in the case of genuinely exceptional matters and in circumstances where
disagreements persist following the exhaustion of all internal procedures.

While the risk of industrial action is mitigated by commercial arrangements and wider stakeholder

management, any significant deterioration in labor relations could result in operational disruptions which could
have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**Failure to attract and retain key personnel may impact our ability to deliver our financial plans.**

The performance of our business depends significantly on the efforts and expertise of management and

other key senior personnel. Retaining qualified commercial, technical and key leadership has become more
challenging in the digital/communications industry where there is significant competition for experienced
personnel. Our growth and success in implementing our business plans largely depends on our continued ability
to attract and retain experienced senior personnel as well as our highly skilled employees, and we may not be
successful in doing so. If any of our management and other key personnel ceases their employment, and we are
not able to replace such persons, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.


-----

**Any acquisitions or divestitures we may make could disrupt our business and materially harm our financial**
**condition, results of operations and cash flows. There are integration and consolidation risks associated**
**with recently completed and potential future acquisitions and divestitures.**

Future acquisitions and divestments may result in significant transaction expenses, increased leverage and

unexpected liabilities. Future acquisitions may result in risks associated with entering new markets, and we may
be unable to profitably operate the acquired businesses.

We may, from time to time, consider certain acquisitions or divestitures, in markets where we currently

operate as well as in markets in which we have not previously operated. We may lack sufficient management
skills, financial and other resources to successfully integrate our acquisitions. In addition, we may not be able to
identify suitable acquisition candidates in the future, or may not be able to finance such acquisitions on favorable
terms.

Acquisitions and divestitures involve numerous other risks, including the diversion of management’s

attention from other business concerns, undisclosed risks impacting the target entity and potential adverse effects
on existing business relationships with current customers and suppliers. In addition, any acquisitions or
divestitures could increase our leverage. Raising external financing could impact our financial position or create
dilution for our shareholders. Any future acquisitions may result in significant transaction expenses, unexpected
liabilities and risks associated with entering new markets in addition to the integration and consolidation risks.

We cannot provide assurances that any acquisitions or divestitures will perform as planned or prove to

be beneficial to our operations and cash flow, or that we will be able to successfully integrate any acquisitions
that we undertake. Any such failure could seriously harm the financial condition of the company, results of
operations and cash flows.

**Our increasing dependence on information technology systems to provide services and run our business**
**exposes us to risks of hacking, piracy, terrorist or cyber-attacks, security breaches, natural disasters,**
**casualties or facilities/systems failure, which could damage our business and potentially lead to regulatory**
**penalties.**

The performance and reliability of our IT systems and facilities, our networks and our fixed line and mobile

telecommunication services, are critical to our ability to attract and retain customers and meet our regulatory
universal service obligations. These include sophisticated critical facilities and systems such as IP routers,
exchanges, switches, transmission systems, other key network points, data centers and core billing and customer
service systems. The hardware supporting these systems is housed in a number of locations. These systems,
facilities (some of which are owned by third parties) and networks, and the services that we provide, may be
subject to damage or disruptions resulting from criminal or terrorist acts or as a result of malicious hacking, piracy
or cyber-attack, or from numerous other events, including infrastructure defects, fire, flood, storm or other natural
disasters, power outages, unanticipated IT problems, computer viruses and equipment, system or infrastructure
failures. Our business continuity plans and our network and IT security policies and procedures may not be
sufficient to prevent or mitigate the impact of any such damage, disruption, economic loss or regulatory penalties.

A major disruption to our infrastructure or to a third-party supplier’s systems could result in a failure of our

networks or systems, or of the third party owned local and long distance networks on which we rely for the
provision of interconnection and roaming services to customers. This would affect the quality of service or cause
temporary service interruptions, which could result in customer dissatisfaction and reputational damage,
regulatory penalties and reduced revenue and earnings and could thereby have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, we operate systems to transmit encrypted digital programs and services, including content over

our mobile and fixed access digital television platform. Our billing and revenue generation for our services also
relies on the proper functioning of such conditional access systems. While we have systems in place to protect us
from the risk of illegal piracy, there can be no assurance that such systems always function as intended. There is
a risk that we will not be able to successfully eliminate the piracy currently faced or that we may face in the future.
In addition, there can be no assurances that any new conditional access system security that we may put in place
will not be circumvented. Encryption failures could result in liability under the contractual arrangements with the
content providers, lower revenues, higher costs and increased subscriber churn or otherwise have a material
adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

**We are subject to regulatory requirements, as well as increasing data security requirements by financial**
**institutions, certain other corporate customers and government entities, with respect to the protection of**
**personal data and data security.**

We collect, store and use data in the ordinary course of our business that is protected by data protection laws. We
are subject to stringent regulations relating to the processing of (including the transfer and storage) personal data,
including, in particular, the General Data Protection Regulation EU 2016/679 (the “GDPR”) . The GDPR has been
directly applicable in all Member States since May 25, 2018. The GDPR has significantly changed the EU/EEA
data protection landscape, including strengthening of individuals’ rights, stricter requirements on companies
processing personal data and stricter sanctions with substantial administrative fines of up to €20 million, or up to
4% of total worldwide annual turnover for the preceding financial year, whichever is higher.

In addition, the Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive 2002/58/EC as implemented in Ireland

via the European Communities (Electronic Communications Networks and Services) (Privacy and Electronic
Communications) Regulations 2011 (S.I. No. 336 of 2011) (as amended) provides for more specific privacy rights
on electronic communications. This Directive includes rules relating to marketing by electronic means (including
marketing calls, texts and emails) and the use of cookies and similar technologies. The European Commission has
proposed enhanced regulations concerning privacy and electronic communications (the “e-Privacy Regulation”),
which would entail additional and stricter rules in respect of the use of personal data from electronic
communications. The e-Privacy Regulation would establish fines similar to those included in GDPR.

As a provider of mobile and landline services to a number of public and private financial institutions,

government entities and corporate customers with data security requirements, we are also subject to increasing
data security requirements of such entities. These customers may continue to increase their data security
requirements, and we may be required to undertake additional investments in order to adhere to these enhanced
data security requirements, as well as to adhere to evolving statutory and regulatory requirements, including
adhering to the GDPR framework, obtaining and maintaining certain ISO certifications, improving access rights
management systems and developing a corporate data encryption infrastructure. As a result, we may incur
additional capital expenditure to satisfy data security requirements.

In the ordinary course of business, we work with independent and third-party suppliers, partners, sales

agents, service providers and call center agents. If the third parties we work with violate applicable laws or
contractual obligations, such violations may also put us in breach of our obligations under privacy laws and
regulations and this could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business. Violation of data protection laws
by us or one of our partners or suppliers may result in fines, reputational harm and the loss of customers, and
breach of contractual obligations may result in the termination of customer contracts, and could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We are subject to cybersecurity risks._**

We collect and store sensitive data and proprietary business information in the ordinary course of our

business. We could be subject to service outages, denial-of-service attacks, ransom and blackmailing or breaches
of security systems, which may result in disruption, unauthorized access, misappropriation or corruption of this
information. Security breaches of our network or data including physical or electronic break-ins, vendor service
outages or hacks, computer viruses, other attacks by hackers or similar breaches can create system disruptions,
shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Although we are not aware of any significant
incidents to date, if we are unable to prevent such security or privacy breaches, our operations could be disrupted,
or we may suffer legal claims, loss of reputation, financial loss, property damage or regulatory penalties because
of lost or misappropriated information, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

Although we take precautions to protect subscriber data in accordance with the privacy requirements

provided for under applicable laws, these precautions might not be successful and certain subscriber data may be
exposed due to human error or technological failure or otherwise be used inappropriately. We work with
independent and third-party suppliers, partners, sales agents, service providers and call center agents, and it is
possible that such third parties could also experience system failures involving the storing or the transmission of
proprietary data. An incident involving disclosure, data modification, loss or security breach or a significant
technical failure could subject us to significant monetary damages or losses, litigation, negative publicity,
regulatory enforcement actions, and liability under our contracts, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.
Although we seek to implement security measures to help prevent cyber theft, we nonetheless are exposed to the
risk that sensitive data and proprietary business information could be wrongfully appropriated, lost, disclosed,
stolen or processed in breach of data protection legislation. Managing these risks have become more difficult in
connection with working-from-home policies that we adopted in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic and


-----

exposes us to additional risk for which additional work, licenses and expertise is needed to detect and prevent the
occurrences from happening. Ransomware and cyber risks have increased in recent years and have also required
us to invest in even more strict back-up procedures, leading to higher operating costs for all of its information
technologies. In addition, concerns regarding our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure or security
of personal information or other privacy-related matters could result in negative publicity and have a material
adverse effect on our reputation and business. Unexpected information technology problems, system failures,
computer viruses, hacker attacks or unauthorized access to our servers could affect the quality of our services,
compromise the confidentiality of customer data or cause service interruptions, which could harm our reputation
and thereby have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

**Criminal and anti-terrorism laws and regulations might result in a heavier regulatory burden on our**
**business and increased operating costs.**

We presently incur significant costs in relation to complying with the data retention requirements imposed

by crime prevention laws and regulations. The Irish Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011 requires all
telephone and Internet service providers to retain call and Internet traffic records (including time and location data
for mobile traffic) for a period of two years and one year respectively for the purpose of the prevention and
investigation of serious crime by the Irish State’s law enforcement agencies.

An actual or threatened act of terrorism or similar event could lead to a significantly higher regulatory

burden on our business, and result in increased costs. We may also be required to assist Government departments
in certain circumstances, such as national emergencies, which may require us to incur additional expenditures or
to suffer disruptions to our network.

Moreover, any regulation restricting our ability to freely choose a business partner or that may restrict us

to use certain technology or infrastructure could increase our costs. Having run an extensive request for proposal
process for an equipment provider for our mobile network investment, we appointed Ericsson as our core network
strategic partner, with Huawei providing the radio access network equipment. In recent years, some government
agencies have, however, raised concerns about the security of Huawei’s 5G network equipment. and while this
has focused on the core network, the focus could shift to radio access network and the Irish or European authorities
could move to restrict Huawei’s inclusion in mobile networks, which could slow the upgrade of our mobile
network. For example, in July 2020, following advice from the National Cyber Security Centre, the UK
Government announced new controls on the use of Huawei 5G equipment, including a ban on the purchase of
new Huawei equipment from December 31, 2020 onwards, as well as a commitment to remove all Huawei
equipment from 5G networks by 2027. While no similar bans have been implemented in Ireland, any regulation
restricting our ability to freely choose a business partner or that may restrict us to use certain technology or
infrastructure could increase our costs or affect our growth, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We are exposed to the risk of fraudulent or otherwise improper behavior by customers, distribution partners,_**
**_suppliers, employees and others, which our risk management and internal controls may not prevent or detect._**

We are exposed to the risk that customers, distribution partners, suppliers, employees and others with

whom we deal may act fraudulently by receiving or granting inappropriate benefits or generally using corrupt,
fraudulent or other unfair business practices. While we seek to manage these risks and take steps to detect any
such fraud, our compliance processes and internal controls may not prove sufficient to effectively prevent or detect
inadequate practices, fraud and violations of law or our policies by our subsidiaries, intermediaries, employees,
outsourced staff, directors and officers and we may not detect all such fraudulent activity, and, even where we do,
may not be able to prevent or recover losses incurred. Significant or regular fraudulent or improper activities may
have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation and could also
lead to regulatory actions.

For example, some of our customers could falsify their names or use fake or stolen documents of

identification to by-pass our credit checks and verification process, use stolen credit cards for payments or obtain
unlawful access to our or other customers’ system or otherwise place large number of fraudulent calls, _e.g., to_
national or international rate service numbers. In addition, some of our distribution partners may by-pass our rules
and processes to obtain unjustified commissions for justified, or in some cases, fraudulent sales to our customers.

Likewise, our employees could grant unjustified discounts to certain customers that are inconsistent with

our rate plans. Since our employees have access to our infrastructure, it is possible that they steal money, devices
and other objects of value. Our employees and contracting third parties (including outsourced staff that processes
some of our data) could also use our information, confidential customer information or other confidential


-----

information provided by third parties to us for personal or other improper purposes, as well as misrepresent or
conceal improper activities from us. Such practices could result in legal sanctions, penalties and loss of business
as well as harm to our reputation.

Our employees and contracting third parties (including outsourced staff that processes some of our data)

may also commit errors or take actions that could subject us to financial claims for negligence or otherwise as
well as regulatory actions. Such errors or actions could result in unforeseen business risk, losses, and regulatory
and other sanctions, could damage our reputation and expose us to litigation, including financial losses resulting
from the need to reimburse customers or business partners or as a result of fines or other regulatory sanctions.

Additionally, customers or others may misuse our networks in ways that could damage our reputation

and result in regulatory or other measures that increase our costs. Examples of such potential misuse include using
the network to make inappropriate contact with children, spamming, propagation of viruses, piracy of intellectual
property, or engaging in fraudulent activities. As the telecommunications sector has become increasingly
digitalized, automated and online-based, we have become exposed to increased risks of hacking and general
information technology system failures.

**The loss of important intellectual property rights, including key trademarks and domain names, could**
**adversely affect our business and results of operations.**

Certain of our intellectual property rights, including key trademarks and domain names, which we believe

are well known in the telecommunications markets in which we operate, are important to our business. A
significant portion of our revenue is derived from products and services marketed under our brand names. We rely
upon a combination of trademark laws, copyright and data base protection as well as, where appropriate,
contractual arrangements to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. From time to time, we may make
claims against third parties to protect our intellectual property rights against infringement. These claims can result
in protracted and costly litigation, regardless of their merits, and may not ultimately be successful, which could
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition to the risk that a third party may infringe our intellectual property rights, from time to time, third

parties (including any of our competitors and/or business partners) may claim that we are infringing that third
party’s intellectual property rights. As a result, we may not be able to use intellectual property that is material to
the operation of our business and/or may be obliged to pay damages or take further actions. These cases can result
in protracted and costly litigation, regardless of their merits, and can cause adverse affects to our business and
profitability. Such litigation with third parties who are also commercial business partners in certain areas of our
business could result in more hostile or problematic commercial relationships with such third parties and in turn
adversely impact such areas of business.

Alternatively, a third party may allege that one of our suppliers or customers is infringing that third

party’s intellectual property rights, and may bring a lawsuit to prevent such supplier from providing us with
products or services important to our business, or customers from purchasing our products and services. If such a
lawsuit were successful, we may be forced to stop using or selling the product or service, pay damages and/or we
may be required to undertake further remedial activities or efforts, either of which could have an adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our insurance may not be adequate to cover losses or liabilities that may arise._**

We maintain insurance for some, but not all, the potential risks and liabilities associated with our

business. Any damage or failure that causes an interruption in services could reduce our revenue and have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, while our property risk
insurance covers certain property damage caused by natural disasters up to a specified limit, we do not carry
insurance for all damage and losses caused by natural disasters. Further, insurance against acts of terrorism is not
always available in each jurisdiction in which we operate or may be prohibitively expensive. If we seek to obtain
additional insurance coverage in the future, insurance may only be available at premium levels that are
prohibitively expensive. To the extent such losses or payments are not insured or the insured amount is not
adequate, losses incurred or payments we may be required to make may have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**In the ordinary course of our business, we may become subject to lawsuits, indemnity or other claims, which**
**could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability,**
**cash flows and growth prospects.**

From time to time, we are subject to various claims, lawsuits and other legal proceedings brought or

threatened against us in the ordinary course of our business including, but not limited to, claims brought by third


-----

parties which provide services in connection with our business. For additional information, see “Business—
_Litigation.” These actions and proceedings may seek, among other things, compensation for alleged breach of_
contract, punitive damages and civil penalties or other losses, liquidated damages, consequential damages, or
injunctive or declaratory relief. We review the status of any pending or threatened proceedings with legal counsel
on a regular basis. In determining whether accounting provisions are required in respect of pending or threatened
litigation, we review the period in which the underlying cause of the litigation or of the actual or possible claim
or assessment occurred, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome, and the ability to make a reasonable
estimate of the amount of potential loss. Upon considering these factors and any other known relevant facts and
circumstances, we recognize any loss that is considered probable and reasonably quantifiable as of the balance
sheet date.

The outcome of any litigation is difficult to assess or quantify and may not be consistent with our

estimates and assessment of liabilities. Furthermore, because litigation is inherently uncertain, the ultimate
resolution of any such claim, lawsuit or proceeding through settlement, mediation, or court judgment could have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, claims, lawsuits
and proceedings may harm our reputation or divert management’s attention from our business or divert resources
away from operating our business, and cause us to incur significant expenses, any of which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows and growth
prospects.

**As members of our workforce sometimes work on ageing infrastructure, work at heights and/or work alone,**
**there is a risk of a failure to comply with health and safety policies that could lead to serious accidents,**
**material claims, or fines.**

We have a Fixed Access Repair field force, and have in place health and safety policies, guidelines, alerts

and safe working practices to help minimize the main risks that could arise, such as fall from ladders, fall from
poles, pole breaks and incidents during lone working. We also occupy premises that may contain or may have
contained hazardous materials, such as asbestos, which we control and monitor. While we aim to eliminate health
and safety risks where reasonably practicable, it is not possible to eliminate all risks when staff are working on
ageing infrastructure, working at heights and/or working alone. Any serious accident, material claim or fine in
connection with any such incident could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

**Our business may be adversely affected by actual or perceived health risks and other environmental**
**requirements relating to mobile telecommunications transmission equipment and devices, including the**
**location of antennas.**

We operate our mobile network in full compliance with our license conditions and continue to engage

with relevant state bodies and the general public on our network transmitter sites and locations including the
measurement of radio frequencies on transmitter sites as required. There can, however, be no certainty that further
medical research and studies will not establish a link between the radio frequency emissions of mobile handsets
and/or base stations and health concerns.

The actual or perceived risk of mobile and wireless telecommunications devices, press reports about risks

or consumer litigation relating to such risks could result in decreased mobile usage, increased litigation costs or
stricter regulation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations. These health concerns may cause the Irish authorities in the future to impose stricter regulations on
the construction of base stations or other telecommunications network infrastructure, which may hinder the
completion or increase the cost of network deployment, and reduce the coverage of our network. Moreover, if
these health risks were to materialize, actual costs or damages could be significantly in excess of any limited
insurance protection that we may have and we may have difficulty obtaining appropriate insurance protection for
such risks. MNOs could be held liable for the cost of damages associated with these risks, which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We are also subject to a variety of laws and regulations relating to land use and the protection of the

environment, including those governing the storage, management and disposal of hazardous materials and the
clean-up of contaminated sites. We could incur substantial costs, including clean-up costs, fines, sanctions and
third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, such
laws and regulations, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations.


-----

**Our obligations under our employee pension schemes could adversely impact our cash flows, results of**
**operations, financial condition and ability to pay dividends.**

We operate a defined benefit pension scheme for certain employees and a significant number of past

employees. The eircom Superannuation Fund satisfied the requirements of Part IV of the Pensions Act 1990 (the
Minimum Funding Standard and Minimum Funding Standard Reserve) as of March 31, 2022 – the date of the last
full triennial actuarial valuation – and no additional funding was required. If the scheme, however, were to go into
deficit under the Minimum Funding Standard or actuarial valuation basis, the trustees might seek increased
funding to restore the balance or, alternatively, either the trustees or the Group could seek to make changes to the
scheme. Although we would likely take actions to limit any additional funding requirement, in such circumstances
we may be obliged to make increased contributions to the pension scheme, which might in turn result in increased
costs and cash outflows and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**Our business is subject to tax laws and regulations, the interpretation of which may change in ways that**
**could be adverse to our business, results of operation and financial condition.**

We are subject to complex tax laws. Changes in tax laws or practice could adversely affect our tax

position, including our effective tax rate or tax payments. We often rely on generally available interpretations of
applicable tax laws. There cannot be certainty that the relevant tax authorities are in agreement with our
interpretation of these laws. If our positions are challenged by relevant tax authorities, the imposition of additional
taxes could require us to pay taxes that we currently do not collect or pay or increase the costs of our services to
track and collect such taxes, which could increase our costs of operations or our effective tax rate. The occurrence
of any of the foregoing tax risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

If a Guarantor makes any payments in respect of interest on Notes, it is possible that such payments may

be subject to withholding tax at applicable rates subject to such relief as may be available under the provisions of
any applicable double taxation treaty or to any other exemption which may apply. It is not certain that such
payments by the Guarantors will be eligible for relief or the exemptions to the same extent the Issuer would be.

_OECD Model GloBE Rules and the Implementation of the Council Directive on GloBE Rules in Ireland_

On December 20, 2021, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (the “OECD”)

published the draft Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules which are aimed at ensuring that Multinational
Enterprises (“MNEs”) are subject to a global minimum effective tax rate of 15%. A directive to implement the
rules on minimum effective taxation in the EU (the “Pillar 2 Directive”) was adopted by the Council of the EU
on December 15, 2022.

The Pillar 2 Directive introduces a minimum effective tax rate of 15% for MNEs (or large-scale domestic

groups) with consolidated revenues of at least €750 million for at least two of the previous four fiscal years which
are operating in the EU's internal market and beyond (an “In-Scope Group”). It provides a common framework
for implementing a set of three complementary rules known as the GLoBE rules comprising of the (qualified)
domestic top up tax (“DTT”), the income inclusion rule (“IIR”), and a backstop rule known as the undertaxed
profit rule (“UTPR”). The DTT ensures that the 15% rate applies to relevant companies operating in each Member
State. The IIR requires the ultimate parent entity of the group to look down through its group on a jurisdictionby-jurisdiction basis and in the event that any of its subsidiaries do not pay an effective tax rate of 15% the ultimate
parent entity would have to pay a top-up tax for low taxed entities in a jurisdiction. The UTPR acts as a backstop
rule to tax profits not subject to DTT or IIR, i.e. where the group does not apply or fully impose the top-up tax
under the IIR rule, additional top-up tax can be collected at the subsidiary as opposed to ultimate parent entity
level. The Pillar 2 Directive was required to be transposed by all EU Member States by December 31, 2023. The
implementing Irish legislation is contained in the Irish Finance (No. 2) Act 2023 and applies for accounting
periods commencing on or after December 31, 2023 (the “Irish Pillar 2 Legislation”).

The Issuer expects to be a constituent entity of an In-Scope Group for the purposes of the Pillar 2

Legislation (the “Group”) and therefore will be within the scope of the charge to tax under the Irish Pillar 2
Legislation. The exact position will depend on the effective tax rate of the Group and constituent entities located
in Ireland. The Group is in the process of assessing its exposure under the Irish Pillar 2 Legislation and this
assessment indicates that the Group's effective tax rate may be marginally below 15%. However, although the
average effective tax rate may be below 15%, due to the impact of specific adjustments in the Irish Pillar 2
Legislation it is envisaged that the Group may not be exposed to paying additional Pillar Two top-up taxes. To
the extent that the Group is liable to additional top-up taxes, it is not expected that such additional top-up taxes


-----

would be material in terms of the Issuer’s and Guarantor’s ability to meet the payment obligations under the Notes.

The rules contained in the Irish Pillar 2 Legislation are new and complex and it is not yet known how the

Irish Revenue will interpret or apply them. Therefore, the potential application of the Irish Pillar 2 Legislation to
the Issuer cannot be determined with certainty.

**We may suffer unforeseen costs and significant impacts to services and operations as a result of serious**
**storms or floods and other extreme weather events that impact our network infrastructure, the threat of**
**which may be increasing as a result of climate change.**

We have previously suffered significant costs in repairing our infrastructure from the effects of storms

and floods. Climate change may increase the likelihood of such weather volatility and unusually severe storms
and we may suffer increasing damage from storms and floods, requiring increased costs to repair and degrading
our service performance, which could result in customer dissatisfaction and adverse regulatory action. The
worsening of climate change also increases the likelihood and severity of extreme weather events such as heat
waves floods and windstorms which may cause severe disruptions to telecommunications and ICT services and
reduce the work efficiency (hours actually worked). More extreme weather may also drive the need for additional
investments in cooling technology and other more resilient infrastructure. Any of these events could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**Risks Relating to Regulatory and Licensing Matters – Fixed Line Business and Mobile Business**

**ComReg periodically issues pricing directions covering our services, which may have a negative impact on**
**our fixed line revenue and operating profit.**

ComReg requires us to provide wholesale services to OAOs and regulates the prices at which we offer

these services. Our regulated services—which include, access to our physical network infrastructure, wholesale
NGA broadband access (“WLA”) services, leased lines and related interconnection services—generally are
subject to access, non-discrimination, transparency and price control obligations, including cost orientation
obligations and/or margin squeeze tests. ComReg has imposed cost-oriented price controls for access to eir’s
Physical Infrastructure Assets (PLA), i.e. ducts and poles.

We must also obtain prior ComReg approval before we can offer certain new services in a relevant market

where we are designated with SMP and before we can change the price of existing wholesale regulated services
which places restrictions on our ability to launch new services and product pricing. An ongoing positive regulatory
environment is required to support continued network investment and roll-out. If ComReg withholds or delays
approval for, or places significant restrictions on our ability to launch, new bundled products and services, more
competitive regulated services, or new broadband services, and by reducing the costs of our competitors and
constraining our ability to lower prices in retail markets, the price controls could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

ComReg’s market analysis decision (D05/24) requires us to pre-notify retail offers and pre-notify

wholesale discounts and promotions. If ComReg do not approve such promotions and discounts, then this may
impair our ability to compete with retailers and/or wholesale service providers who are not restricted from offering
discounts, and may contribute to a loss of market share, which would negatively impact our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**Our fixed and mobile businesses are subject to regulatory rules set by the EU which, if changed, may**
**negatively impact on the results of operations.**

The basic framework for regulation of the Irish telecommunications market is derived from the EU

Regulatory Framework which was originally adopted by the EU in 2002 for all aspects of electronic
communications networks and services across the EU. The main policy objectives of the EU Regulatory
Framework are to promote competition, to contribute to the development of the internal market, and to protect the
interests of citizens. National regulators have discretion to impose regulatory obligations in line with national
circumstances. Future changes to the EU Regulatory Framework could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**Regulatory investigations and litigation may lead to fines or other penalties.**

ComReg and other regulatory bodies occasionally make enquiries and conduct investigations concerning

our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. On occasion, we are involved in litigation and regulatory
enquiries and investigations involving our operations, which may lead to fines and other penalties that could have


-----

an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Further regulatory intervention could have
an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**Planning license fees, if applicable to us, may adversely affect our results of operations.**

Under Irish planning legislation introduced in 2002, where a license is granted by a planning authority

to a person to erect, construct, place and maintain overhead cables or wires on, over or along a public road, a fee
is payable to the planning authority for every year or part of a year for which the license is granted. This fee could
be determined to apply to our networks, which encompass overhead wires and poles. If it is determined that the
license fee is applicable to our networks and is enforced on an annual basis, it may increase our costs and adversely
affect results of operations. In the intervening period since the 2002 legislation, no planning authority has applied
the fee in respect of overhead wires and poles. In December 2016, a government taskforce published a host of
recommendations to enhance the development of mobile network sites including provisions to make state
infrastructure available for MNOs. Broadband officers have been appointed in each local authority to engage with
MNOs on prospective transmitter sites and support engagement in communities for the continued improvement
of mobile voice and data services. eir has engaged with the taskforce and with appointed broadband officers to
develop mobile network infrastructure utilizing public infrastructure on a cost-effective basis. There can be no
guarantee, however, that public policy will continue to support the development of telecommunications
infrastructure on public rights of way on a cost-effective basis.

**Changes in our regulated weighted average cost of capital could have an adverse impact on our revenue**
**and results of operations.**

In June 2023, ComReg issued a decision notice directing that a nominal pre-tax weighted average cost

of capital of 4.93% be used for the purpose of our separated regulated accounts, and as a basis for allowing us an
adequate rate of return for regulatory purposes, including in the setting of our regulated wholesale prices. Any
reduction in our regulated weighted average cost of capital could have an adverse impact on our revenue and
results of operations.

**Risks Related to Our Financial Profile**

**Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business and prevent us**
**from fulfilling our obligations with respect to the Notes and the Guarantees.**

We are highly leveraged. As of March 31, 2024, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the

Transaction, we had total gross debt of €3,064 million, which includes the Notes, the Existing Notes, the amounts
drawn under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the amounts drawn under the FNI Facilities.

The degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to holders of the Notes,

including but not limited to:

      - making it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the notes, guarantees and other
debts and liabilities;

      - increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic
and industry conditions;

      - requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of
principal of, and interest on, indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to
fund working capital, capital expenditures, spectrum license payments, acquisitions, joint ventures,
product research and development, subscriber acquisition costs or other general corporate purposes,
as well as our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders;

      - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the competitive
environment and the industry in which we operate;

      - placing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors, to the extent that they are
not as highly leveraged;

      - limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing; and

      - limiting our options for refinancing the Notes and our other indebtedness when it falls due.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our business,

financial condition and results of operations, as well as our ability to satisfy our debt obligations, including the
Notes.


-----

**We are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future operations**
**and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities.**

The Indenture will restrict, among other things, our ability to:

      - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock;

      - create or incur certain liens;

      - make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions;

      - prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity;

      - make certain investments;

      - create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or
advances to, and on the transfer of, assets to EHIL and its restricted subsidiaries;

      - sell, lease or transfer certain assets, including stock of restricted subsidiaries;

      - engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

      - consolidate or merge with other entities; and

      - impair the security interests in the collateral.

All of these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of

_the Notes—Certain Covenants.” The covenants to which we are subject could limit our ability to finance our future_
operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our
interest. We are also subject to the restrictive debt covenants under the terms of the Existing Indentures. See
“Description of Other Indebtedness—2026 Notes.” In addition, we are subject to the affirmative and negative
covenants contained in the Senior Facilities Agreement which also limits our flexibility and requires us to satisfy
various financial covenants. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Senior Facilities Agreement.”

**Certain covenants may be suspended upon the occurrence of a change in the Issuer’s ratings.**

The Indenture will provide that, if at any time following the date of issuance, the Notes receive a rating

of Baa3 or better by Moody’s and a rating of BBB- or better by S&P and no default or event of default has occurred
and is continuing, then beginning that day and continuing until such time, if any, at which the Notes cease to have
such ratings, certain covenants will cease to be applicable to the Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Certain
_Covenants—Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status.” If these covenants were to_
cease to be applicable, the Issuer, EHIL and its restricted subsidiaries may, subject to the terms of the Senior
Facilities Agreement and other indebtedness, be able to incur additional debt or make payments, including
dividends or investments, which may conflict with the interests of the holders of the Notes. There can be no
assurance that the Notes will ever achieve an investment grade rating or that any such rating will be maintained.

**We will require a significant amount of cash to meet our obligations under our indebtedness and to**
**sustain our operations, which we may not be able to generate or raise.**

Our ability to make principal or interest payments when due on our indebtedness, including the Senior

Facilities Agreement, the Existing Notes and the Notes, and to fund our ongoing operations, will depend on our
future performance and our ability to generate cash, which is subject to general economic, financial, competitive,
legislative, legal, regulatory and other factors, as well as other factors discussed in these “Risk Factors,” many of
which are beyond our control. The indebtedness outstanding under Facility B of the Senior Facilities Agreement
will mature on May 15, 2026, the indebtedness outstanding under Facility B3 of the Senior Facilities Agreement
will mature on May 15, 2029, the 2026 Notes will mature on May 15, 2026 and the 2027 Notes will mature on
February 15, 2027. See “Description of Other Indebtedness.” At the maturity of the facilities under the Senior
Facilities Agreement, the 2026 Notes, the 2027 Notes, the Notes or any other debt which we may incur, if we do
not have sufficient cash flows from operations and other capital resources to pay these debt obligations, or to fund
our other liquidity needs or we are otherwise restricted from doing so due to corporate, tax or contractual
limitations, we may be required to further refinance our indebtedness. If we are unable to refinance all or a portion
of our indebtedness or obtain such refinancing on terms acceptable to us, we may be forced to reduce or delay our
business activities or capital expenditures, sell assets, or raise additional debt or equity financing in amounts that
could be substantial. The type, timing and terms of any future financing will depend on our cash needs and the
prevailing conditions in the financial markets. We cannot assure you that we will be able to accomplish any of
these measures in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of our


-----

Senior Facilities Agreement, the Existing Indentures and the Indenture and any future debt may limit our ability
to pursue any of the foregoing measures.

**Despite our current level of indebtedness, we may still be able to incur substantially more debt in the**
**future, which may make it difficult for us to service our debt, including the Notes, and impair our ability**
**to operate our businesses.**

We may incur substantial additional debt in the future. Any debt that we incur at any subsidiary that does

not guarantee the Notes would be structurally senior to the Notes, and other debt could be secured or could mature
prior to the Notes. Although the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Existing Indentures contain and the Indenture
will contain, restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number
of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances the amount of indebtedness that
could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If we incur additional debt, the related
risks that we now face would increase. An increase in our indebtedness could also lead to a downgrade of the
ratings assigned to eircom Holdings (Ireland) Limited or the Notes, either of which could negatively affect the
trading price of the Notes. In addition, the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Existing Indentures do not and the
Indenture will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under those
agreements.

**The loans under our Senior Facilities Agreement bear interest at floating rates. Such floating rates could**
**rise significantly, increasing our costs and our cash flow.**

The loans under our Senior Facilities Agreement bear interest at floating rates of interest per annum equal

to EURIBOR, as adjusted periodically, plus a spread. These interest rates could rise significantly in the future.

Although we have entered into certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates in

respect of the term loan under our Senior Facilities Agreement, there can be no assurance that such hedging will
continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms for as long as such indebtedness remains outstanding.
To the extent that interest rates were to increase significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly
increase, reducing our cash flow. Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed
to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on commercially
reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount
(including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. To the extent interest rates were to rise significantly, our
interest expense would correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow.

**Risks Related to the Notes**

**The Notes and the Guarantees will be subordinated to certain hedging obligations and may be subordinated**
**in the future, and such hedging obligations may also be repaid with the proceeds of the collateral securing**
**the Notes in priority to the Notes.**

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes and the Guarantees rank junior in right of

payment to certain “super priority” hedging obligations incurred in respect of the Senior Facilities Agreement and
the 2026 Notes Indenture. Accordingly, if the Issuer or any of the Guarantors dissolves, winds-up or liquidates,
or if any of them is the subject of any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding, counterparties to the relevant
hedging arrangements would be entitled to receive payment in full of all obligations due thereunder before the
holders of the Notes would be entitled to receive any payment with respect to the Notes or the Guarantees.

The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that proceeds from enforcement of the collateral securing the

Notes must first be applied in satisfaction in full of obligations under these “super priority” hedging obligations
and, only thereafter, to repay the obligations under the Notes, the Existing Notes and the Senior Facilities
Agreement. Any such “super priority” hedging debt will be secured by the same property and assets that secure
the Notes, the Existing Notes and the Senior Facilities Agreement. As such, in the event of enforcement of the
collateral securing the Notes, you may not be able to recover on such collateral if the then-outstanding liabilities
under such “super priority” hedging debt are greater than the proceeds realized in the event of enforcement of the
collateral securing the Notes.

**The security interests in the collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the**
**holders of the Notes.**

The security interests in the collateral that will secure our obligations under the Notes and the obligations

of the Guarantors under the Guarantees will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes, but will instead be
granted only in favor of the Security Agent. The Indenture will provide (in addition to the Intercreditor Agreement)
that only the Security Agent has the right to enforce such collateral. As a consequence, holders of the Notes will
not have direct security interests in the collateral and will not be entitled to take independent enforcement action


-----

in respect of such collateral, except through the Trustee, which will, subject to the applicable provisions of the
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of such collateral.

**Holders of the Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the collateral.**

The Notes will be secured by the same collateral securing the Senior Facilities Agreement and the 2026

Notes. In addition, under the terms of the Existing Indentures we are permitted and under the terms of the
Indenture, we will be permitted to incur significant additional indebtedness and other obligations that may be
secured by such collateral.

As a result of the voting provisions set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement, under certain circumstances,

the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement and counterparties to certain hedging arrangements could have
effective control of all decisions with respect to the collateral. Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the
Security Agent serves as a common security agent for the secured parties under the Senior Facilities Agreement,
certain hedging obligations, the Existing Notes and the Notes. Subject to certain limited exceptions, the Security
Agent will act with respect to such collateral only at the direction of an “Instructing Group.”

The holders of the Notes will not have separate rights to enforce the collateral securing the Notes. In

addition, the holders of the Notes will not be able to instruct the Security Agent, force a sale of collateral or
otherwise independently pursue the remedies of a secured creditor under the relevant security documents, unless
they comprise an Instructing Group which is entitled to give such instructions (provided that, if the liabilities in
respect of the Notes represent less than 30% of the aggregate of the outstanding liabilities under the Notes, the
Existing Notes, the Senior Facilities Agreement and certain hedging agreements, the votes of the holders of the
Notes shall not be canvassed by the Security Agent and the holders of the Notes shall be deemed to have voted in
the same manner and in the same proportion as the holders of the Existing Notes, the creditors under the Senior
Facilities Agreement and the hedge counterparties under certain hedging contracts). Disputes may occur between
the holders of the Notes and creditors under our Senior Facilities Agreement and the Existing Notes, the
counterparties to certain hedging arrangements or holders of any permitted additional indebtedness as to the
appropriate manner of pursuing enforcement remedies and strategies with respect to the collateral. In such an
event, the holders of the Notes will be bound by any decisions of the Instructing Group, which may result in
enforcement action in respect of the collateral for the Notes, whether or not such action is approved by the holders
of the Notes or may be adverse to such holders. The holders of the Existing Notes, the creditors under the Senior
Facilities Agreement, the counterparties to certain hedging arrangements or the holders of certain other permitted
additional indebtedness may also have interests that are different from the interest of holders of the Notes and they
may elect to pursue their remedies under the relevant security documents at a time when it would otherwise be
disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor
_Agreement.”_

**The security interests in the collateral securing the Notes will not be granted over all of the collateral until**
**no later than ninety business days from the Issue Date.**

The security interests in the collateral will not be granted over all of the collateral until no later than

ninety business days from the Issue Date, as further described under “Description of the Notes—Security.” There
can be no assurance, however, that we will be successful in procuring such liens within the time periods specified,
the failure of which would result in an “event of default” under the Indenture. The security interests will be limited
to the same extent as those under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Existing Indentures and otherwise as
set forth under “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security Interests and Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations,” which limitations could be significant. It should be noted that if a security_
interest granted by a security provider in certain jurisdictions is granted or perfected after the secured obligation
arose, such security interest may be subject to clawback provisions under applicable local insolvency laws. See
“Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations.”_

**The collateral may not be sufficient to secure the obligations under the Notes.**

Within 90 days of the Issue Date, the Notes and the Guarantees will be secured by security interests in the

collateral described in this Offering Memorandum, which collateral also secures the obligations under the Senior
Facilities Agreement and the Existing Notes on a _pari passu basis as well as certain hedging obligations as_
described elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The collateral may also secure additional debt to the extent
permitted by the terms of the Existing Indentures, the Indenture, the Senior Facilities Agreement and the
Intercreditor Agreement. Your rights to the collateral may be diluted by any increase in the debt secured by the
collateral or a reduction of the collateral securing the Notes.


-----

The value of the collateral that will secure the Notes and the amount to be received upon an enforcement of

such collateral will depend upon many factors, including, amongst other things, the ability to sell such collateral
in an orderly sale, the costs of realization and any requirements to pay any of the proceeds to preferential creditors
such as tax authorities and employees, economic conditions where our business operations are located and the
availability of buyers of such collateral. The book value of the collateral should not be relied on as a measure of
realizable value for such assets. All or a portion of the collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily
ascertainable market value. Similarly, we cannot assure you that there will be a market for the sale of the collateral,
or, if such a market exists, that there will not be a substantial delay in its liquidation. In addition, the share pledges
over the shares of an entity may be of no value if the relevant entity is subject to an insolvency or bankruptcy
proceeding.

In addition, our business requires a variety of permits and licenses. The continued operation of properties

that comprise part of the collateral and that depend on the maintenance of such permits and licenses may be
prohibited or restricted. Our business is also subject to regulations and permit requirements and may be adversely
affected if we are unable to comply with existing regulations or requirements or if changes in applicable
regulations or requirements occur. In the event of foreclosure of all or any part of our business, the grant of permits
and licenses may be revoked or the transfer of such permits and licenses may be prohibited or may require us to
incur significant cost and expense. Further, we cannot assure you that the applicable governmental authorities will
consent to the transfer of all such permits. If the regulatory approvals required for such transfers are not obtained
or are delayed or otherwise economically prevented, the foreclosure may be delayed, a temporary or lasting
shutdown of operations may result, and the value of the collateral may be significantly diminished.

**It may be difficult to realize the value of the collateral securing the Notes. The ability of the Security**
**Agent to enforce certain of the collateral may be restricted by local law.**

The collateral securing the Notes will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and

other imperfections permitted under the Indenture, the Existing Indentures the Senior Facilities Agreement and/or
the Intercreditor Agreement and accepted by other creditors that have the benefit of priority security interests in
the collateral securing the Notes from time to time, whether on or after the date the Notes are first issued. The
existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the
value of the collateral securing the Notes, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on
such collateral. Furthermore, the ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including,
among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or recharacterization under the
laws of certain jurisdictions.

The security interests will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of

security interests in collateral. For example, the enforcement of a share pledge, whether by means of a sale or an
appropriation, is subject to certain specific requirements. The Security Agent may also need to obtain the consent
of a third party to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain
any such consents. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required
to facilitate a foreclosure on the relevant collateral. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to
foreclose upon certain collateral, and the value of the collateral may decline significantly.

**You may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes.**

The Notes are denominated and payable in euro. If you measure your investment returns by reference to a

currency other than euro, an investment in the Notes entails foreign exchange-related risks, including possible
significant changes in the value of euro relative to the currency by reference to which you measure your investment
returns because of economic, political and other factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the euro
against the currency by reference to which you measure your investment returns could cause a decrease in the
effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to you when the return on
the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which you measure your investment returns. There may
be tax consequences for you as a result of any foreign exchange gains resulting from any investment in the Notes
and you should consult with your own tax advisors regarding any such tax consequences.

**Risks Related to Our Structure**

**The Issuer is a finance subsidiary that has no revenue generating operations of its own and depends on**
**cash received under its intercompany loan in order to be able to make payments on the Notes.**

The Issuer is a finance subsidiary that was formed in order to offer and issue debt securities. The Issuer

conducts no business operations of its own, and has not engaged in, and will not be permitted to engage in, any
activities other than those relating to its finance activities. The Issuer will be dependent upon payments from
members of the Group to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Notes, the Existing Notes and


-----

the Senior Facilities Agreement. We intend to provide funds to the Issuer in order for the Issuer to meet its
obligations under the Notes through interest payments on the relevant note proceeds loan agreements or other
intercompany loans or distributions. If we do not fulfil our obligations under the note proceeds loan agreements
or other intercompany loans, the Issuer will not have any other source of funds that would allow it to make
payments to the holders of the Notes. The amounts available to the Issuer from EHIL or any other relevant
members of the Group will depend on the profitability and cash flows of such members of the Group and the
ability of such members to make payments to it under applicable law or the terms of any financing agreements or
other contracts that may limit or restrict their ability to pay such amounts. Various agreements governing our debt
may restrict and, in some cases may actually prohibit, the ability of subsidiaries to move cash within the restricted
group. Such restrictions include those created by the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of Other
_Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.” Applicable tax laws may also subject such payments to further taxation._
In addition, the members of the Group that do not guarantee the Notes have no obligation to make payments with
respect to the Notes.

**There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the collateral**
**securing the Notes and the Guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent**
**of the Trustee.**

Under various circumstances, the Guarantees and the collateral securing the Notes will be released

automatically, including, without limitation:

##### • in the case of collateral, in connection with any sale or other disposition to any third party of the property
or assets constituting collateral, so long as the sale or other disposition is permitted by the Indenture;

##### • in accordance with the amendments and waivers provisions of the Indenture as described under the
caption “Description of the Notes—Amendments and Waivers”;

##### • upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as provided
under the captions “Description of the Notes—Defeasance” and “Description of the Notes—Satisfaction
_and Discharge”;_

##### • with respect to the property and assets securing the Notes, automatically if a security interest granted in
favor of the Senior Facilities Agreement, public debt or such other indebtedness that gave rise to the
obligation to grant the security interest over such property and assets is released (other than pursuant to
the payment and discharge thereof);

##### • to the extent that such Guarantor is unconditionally released and discharged from its liability with respect
to the Senior Facilities Agreement;

##### • in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement;

 • in connection with a Permitted Reorganization; or

 • as a result of a transaction that would not be prohibited under “Description of the Notes—Merger and
_Consolidation.”_

**The Notes and each of the Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities and preference**
**shares (if any) of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries.**

Generally, claims of creditors of a non-Guarantor subsidiary, and claims of preference shareholders (if

any) of that subsidiary, will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of that subsidiary over the claims
of creditors of its parent entity and any intercompany loans and by holders of the Notes under the Guarantees. In
the event of any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, reorganization, administration or other
bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of any of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries, holders of their indebtedness and
their trade creditors will generally be entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of those subsidiaries
before any assets are made available for distribution to its parent entity. As such, the Notes will be structurally
subordinated to the creditors and preference shareholders (if any) of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries.

**Your rights in the collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the**
**collateral.**

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain assets may not be enforceable, or its priority may not be

retained, if certain actions are not undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor of the security (including the


-----

registration of such security). The security interests securing the Notes may not be enforceable or maintain priority
if we, or the Security Agent, fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these security interests.

In respect of security over claims against third parties (such as claims under contracts or book debts), if

the third party debtor is not notified of the security interest, the holder of the security interest may have difficulty
enforcing such holder’s rights in the collateral with regard to such third parties. In addition, a debtor may discharge
its obligation by paying the security provider and the third party may assert certain defenses and counter-claim
until, but not after, the debtor receives a notification of the existence of the security interest granted by the security
provider in favor of the security-taker over the claims the security-taker (as creditor) has against the debtor.

**We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Notes upon**
**the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control as will be required by the Indenture, and**
**the change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the**
**event of certain important corporate events.**

Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a “change of control” under the Indenture, the Issuer

would be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the
principal amount thereof on the date of purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase. If a
change of control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available at such time,
or that we would have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuer to pay the purchase price of the outstanding notes,
including the Notes, or our other then-existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required
repurchases. A change of control may result in an event of default under, or acceleration of, the Existing Notes,
our Senior Facilities Agreement and other indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer
could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not.

Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes following a change of control would constitute a

default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under certain other indebtedness. See
“Description of the Notes—Change of Control.”

The change of control provision in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of

certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar transaction
involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power
or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “Change of Control” as defined in the Indenture.
Except as described under “Description of the Notes—Change of Control,” the Indenture does not contain
provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization,
restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The definition of “Change of Control” in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or substantially

all of the assets of EHIL and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is a limited
body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the
phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to
whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the Issuer’s assets and
its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has
occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.

**The Guarantees will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable law**
**or subject to certain defenses that may adversely affect their validity and enforceability.**

Each Guarantee provides the holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the relevant Guarantor. The

Indenture will provide that each Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the
relevant Guarantor. See “Description of the Notes—Guarantees” and “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability
_of the Guarantees and Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

The Guarantees and the enforcement thereof are subject to certain generally available defenses. Defenses

generally include those that relate to corporate purpose or benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable
preference, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, financial assistance, preservation of share capital, thin
capitalization, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors
generally.

If one or more of the foregoing laws and defenses are applicable, a Guarantor may have no liability or

decreased liability under its Guarantee depending on the amounts of its other obligations and applicable law.

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and other


-----

laws, a court could (i) avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee,
(ii) direct that the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantee to the relevant Guarantor or to
a fund for the benefit of that Guarantor’s creditors or (iii) take other action that is detrimental to you, typically if
the court found that:

##### • the relevant Guarantee was incurred with actual intent to give preference to one creditor over another,
hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the relevant Guarantor or, in certain jurisdictions,
when the granting of the relevant Guarantee has the effect of giving a creditor a preference or the creditor
was aware that the relevant Guarantor was insolvent when the relevant Guarantee was given;

##### • the relevant Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value or corporate
benefit for the relevant Guarantee and/or the relevant Guarantor was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent
because of the relevant Guarantee; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the
relevant Guarantee; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its
ability to pay at maturity;

##### • the relevant Guarantee was held to exceed the corporate objects of the relevant Guarantor or not to be in
the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the relevant Guarantor; or

##### • the amount paid or payable under the relevant Guarantee was in excess of the maximum amount
permitted under applicable law.

We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether any Guarantor was

“insolvent” at the relevant time or that, regardless of method of valuation, a court would not determine that a
Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor
was insolvent on the date a Guarantee was issued, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted unfair
preferences, misappropriation of assets, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. There is hence
a possibility that a Guarantee may be set aside, in which case the relevant entire guarantee liability may be
extinguished. If a court decided that a Guarantee was an unfair preference, misappropriation of assets, fraudulent
transfer or conveyance and voided that Guarantee, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, you may cease
to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and the other
Guarantor(s).

**The insolvency laws of Ireland or the jurisdiction of incorporation or formation of each of the Guarantors**
**may not be as favorable to holders of Notes as U.S. insolvency laws or those of another jurisdiction with**
**which you may be familiar.**

The rights of holders under the Notes and the Guarantees will be subject to the insolvency and

administrative laws of several jurisdictions and you may not be able to effectively enforce your rights in such
complex, multiple bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings. The Notes will be issued by eircom Finance DAC,
which is incorporated under the laws of Ireland, and will be guaranteed by entities organized or incorporated in
England and Wales, Ireland, Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the State of Delaware and Jersey. In the event of a
bankruptcy or insolvency event, proceedings could be initiated in Ireland or in one or more other jurisdictions in
which the Guarantors are domiciled. Such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are likely to be complex and costly
and otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of the rights of holders of the
Notes. The bankruptcy laws of these jurisdictions may be less favorable to your interests as a creditor than the
bankruptcy laws of the U.S. or any other jurisdiction you may be familiar with, including in respect of priority of
creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the ability to influence proceedings and the duration
thereof, and this may limit your ability to receive payments due on the Notes. In the event that any one or more
of the Issuer, the Guarantors, any future guarantors of the Notes, if any, or any other of our subsidiaries
experienced financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions
insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. The insolvency and
other laws of different jurisdictions may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other, including in
the areas of rights of secured and other creditors, the ability to void preferential transfer and certain other
transactions, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of
the proceeding. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any
particular jurisdiction’s laws should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce the rights of holders of the
Notes under the Guarantees or the rights of holders of the Notes under the relevant collateral for the Notes in these
jurisdictions and limit any amounts that you may receive. In addition, in actions brought in countries outside of
the United States, courts may choose to apply their own law rather than the law of the State of New York, which
governs the Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees. The application of foreign law may limit your ability to


-----

enforce your rights under the Notes and the Guarantees. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the
_Guarantees and Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” for further information_

**There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may**
**be limited.**

We cannot assure you as to:

##### • the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

 • your ability to sell your Notes; or

 • the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

The Notes will be new securities for which there is no existing trading market and, as such, there can be

no assurance that an active or liquid trading market will develop in respect of such Notes in the future.

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things,

prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for
non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices
of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a
general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices.
The trading market for the Notes may attract different investors and this may affect the extent to which the Notes
may trade. It is possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have
a negative effect on you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. As a
result, there is no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market
develops, you may not be able to resell your holding of the Notes at a fair value, if at all.

Although an application will be made to Authority for the listing of the Notes on the Official List of the

Exchange, we cannot assure you that the Notes will become admitted or remain listed. Although no assurance is
made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of the admission to trading on the Official List of the Exchange,
failure to be approved for listing or the delisting (whether or not for an alternative admission to listing on another
stock exchange) of the Notes from the Official List of the Exchange may have a material effect on a holder’s
ability to resell the Notes in the secondary market. In addition, the Indenture will allow us to issue additional notes
of such series in the future which could adversely impact the liquidity of the Notes.

**You may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations.**

The Issuer and substantially all of our Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries are organized outside

the United States, and our business is conducted primarily outside the United States. Substantially all of the
directors and executive officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors are non-residents of the United States. Although
we and the Guarantors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action
under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on our directors
and executive officers resident outside the United States. In addition, as substantially all of the assets of the Issuer
and the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries and those of their directors and executive officers are
primarily located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce judgments obtained in the U.S. courts
against them. Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Issuer and the
Guarantors may not be subject to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States.
See “Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.”

**Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be**
**subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time.**

One or more independent credit rating agencies will assign and may from time to time assign credit

ratings to the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market,
additional risk factors discussed herein and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is
not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by
the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given
period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its
judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit
rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms
and conditions of our financing and could adversely affect the value and trading of the Notes.


-----

**The transfer of the Notes is restricted, which may adversely affect their liquidity and the price at which**
**they may be sold.**

None of the Notes and the Guarantees have been, or will be, registered under, and we are not obliged to

register the Notes or the Guarantees under, the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction
and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or a transaction not
subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and any other applicable laws. See “Transfer
_Restrictions.” We have not agreed to or otherwise undertaken to register the Notes or the Guarantees, and do not_
have any intention to do so.

**The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the**
**relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies.**

Unless and until Notes in definitive registered form, or definitive registered notes are issued in exchange

for Book-Entry Interests (as defined below) (which may occur only in very limited circumstances), owners of
Book-Entry Interests will not be considered owners or holders of Notes. The common depositary (or its nominee)
for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the global note. Payments of principal, interest
and other amounts owing on or in respect of the global note representing the Notes will be made to Deutsche Bank
AG, London Branch, as Principal Paying Agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream.
Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants’ accounts that hold Book-Entry Interests in the global
note representing the Notes and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to the
common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, we, the Trustee, the Principal Paying Agent, the Registrar and
the Transfer Agent will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts
to the owners of Book-Entry Interests. Accordingly, if you own a Book-Entry Interest in the Notes, you must rely
on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and if you are not a participant in Euroclear and/or Clearstream,
on the procedures of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations
of a holder of the Notes under the Indenture.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of Book-Entry Interests will not have any direct

rights to act upon any solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes.
Instead, if you own a Book-Entry Interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have received
appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream or, if applicable, from a participant. There can be no
assurance that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on
any matters or on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until the definitive

registered Notes are issued in respect of all Book-Entry Interests, if you own a Book-Entry Interest, you will be
restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. We cannot assure you that the procedures to be
implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the
Notes.

**Investors in the Notes may have limited recourse against the independent auditors.**

See “Independent Auditors” for a description of the independent auditors’ reports on the consolidated non
statutory financial statements of EHIL. The auditors’ reports state that they have been prepared for and only for
EHIL’s directors as a body for management purposes in accordance with the terms of their engagement letters
and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the independent auditors do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the directors of EHIL as a body for their audit work, their audit report or for
the opinions they have formed. The independent auditors’ reports for the accounting periods for the financial years
ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were unqualified. Grant Thornton were the auditors of EHIL
for the accounting period ended December 31, 2023, and Ernst & Young, Chartered Accountants were the auditors
of EHIL for the accounting period ended December 31, 2022. The independent auditors’ reports for EHIL for the
financial years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are included on pages F-15 and F-87 of this
Offering Memorandum, respectively.

Prospective investors in the Notes should understand that in making these statements the independent

auditors confirmed that they do not accept or assume any liability to parties (such as purchasers of the Notes)
other than EHIL and its members as a body with respect to the report and to the independent auditors’ audit work
and opinions. The SEC would not permit such limiting language to be included in a registration statement or a
prospectus used in connection with an offering of securities registered under the U.S. Securities Act or in a report
filed under the U.S. Exchange Act. If a U.S. court (or any other court) were to give effect to such limiting
language, the recourse that investors in the Notes may have against the independent auditors based on their report
on the consolidated financial statements to which it relates could be limited.

**Risks Related to Our Ownership**

**Our shareholders and certain of our affiliates are highly engaged in our business, and adverse changes to**
**our relationship could cause our operations to suffer.**

We work closely with NJJ, Iliad and certain of our affiliates in the management of our operations. Our

success is highly dependent on maintaining our relationship with Xavier Niel, one of our directors and our indirect
majority shareholder, as well as other members of the NJJ team. If NJJ were to lose its key professionals, NJJ may
need to replace such professionals, or we may need to find employees or other advisors to replace the services
NJJ provides to us. Certain of our directors have significant duties with, and spend significant time serving, other
entities and business opportunities and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in allocating time to our
business. Any such factor may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**The interests of our principal shareholders may conflict with your interests.**

The interests of our shareholders, in certain circumstances, may conflict with your interests as holders of

the Notes. Our shareholders are able to appoint a majority of our Board of Directors and thereby indirectly to
determine our corporate strategy, management and policies. In addition, our shareholders have control over our
decisions to enter into any corporate transaction and have the ability to prevent any transaction that requires the
approval of shareholders regardless of whether holders of the Notes believe that any such transactions are in their
own best interests. For example, the shareholders could vote to cause us to incur additional indebtedness, to sell
certain material assets or make dividends, in each case, so long as the Indenture, the Senior Facilities Agreement
and Intercreditor Agreement so permit. The incurrence of additional indebtedness would increase our debt service
obligations and the sale of certain assets could reduce our ability to generate revenue, each of which could
adversely affect holders of the Notes. Conversely, our shareholders may have an interest in not pursuing
acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions that could enhance our cash flow and be beneficial to you. In
addition, the interests of the lenders of our Senior Facilities and our principal shareholders, in certain
circumstances, may conflict with your interests as holders of the Notes.

We are ultimately controlled by NJJ, a holding company of entrepreneur and telecommunications

investor Xavier Niel. The interests of our principal shareholders in other companies in which they own a majority
interest (including the majority interest in Iliad held by Xavier Niel) may also conflict with their interests in the
company. So long as companies controlled by Xavier Niel collectively continue to own a significant amount of
our capital stock, even if such amount is less than 50%, Xavier Niel will continue to be able to strongly influence
or effectively control our decisions. The interests of NJJ or any of our other shareholders may not coincide with
your interests. See “Principal Shareholders.”

**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION**

**AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**

You should read the following discussions together with the consolidated financial statements of EHIL

and the related notes to those financial statements. EHIL has prepared audited consolidated financial statements
as of and for the financial period ended December 31, 2023 in accordance with IFRS, as well as unaudited
consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2024 in accordance with IAS 34.

In addition to financial data described above, in this offering memorandum, we present certain adjusted

financial data that gives effect to changes in our accounting policies. Unless otherwise stated or indicated, in this
Offering Memorandum we present the adjusted financial data.

On March 23, 2022, we sold our joint venture Tetra Ireland Communications Limited (“Tetra”). The

financial information and commentary presented herein includes the results of our joint venture in Tetra on a
proportionate consolidation basis to March 23, 2022.

We present our results of operations for the financial years ended December 31, 2022 on an adjusted

basis, applying the proportionate method of accounting rather than the equity method of accounting in reflecting
Tetra’s results in our consolidated financial statements as we believe such a presentation provides a more
meaningful view of our results of operations. In accordance with IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’, the EHIL
consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended December 31, 2022 apply the equity method of
accounting to Tetra’s results. See also “Presentation of Financial Data.”

**Overview**

We are the sole telecommunications provider in Ireland that offers quad-play bundles on an integrated

network, and we offer a range of retail and wholesale services. We are the principal provider of fixed line
telecommunications and the third largest mobile telecommunications provider in Ireland.

Our fixed line division provides high-speed broadband, voice and data services to individual consumers,

business users and to wholesale customers. The fixed line division contributed 72% of our revenue (before intersegment eliminations) and 74% of our Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve month period ended March 31, 2024. We
have an extensive fixed line telecommunications network in Ireland in terms of both capacity and geographic
reach. According to quarterly data published by ComReg (Source: ComReg report 22/44), we had a market share
for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 of 37.9% of the Irish retail and wholesale fixed line market, based on
revenue. Our mobile division provides standalone mobile services to consumer and business customers and is also
included as part of our bundled offerings. The mobile business contributed 28% of our total revenue (before intersegment eliminations) and 26% of our Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve month period ended March 31, 2024.
Our revenue for the twelve month period ended March 31, 2024 was €1,299 million and our Adjusted EBITDA
for the twelve month period ended March 31, 2024 was €639 million.

We are focused on convergence and long-term customer lifetime value, and our strategy is to connect

everyone and everything in Ireland, whether by high-speed broadband, voice, mobile data or enterprise
datacomms. This strategy is underpinned by a major program of capital expenditure which has facilitated the
transformation of our business. Our vision for our customers is a converged future with seamless access to
fixed and mobile services.

We are currently well underway investing €500 million to roll-out fiber to the home (“FTTH”) to 1.9

million premises across urban and suburban Ireland, while also investing €250 million updating and expanding
our mobile network with a view to significantly increasing our high-speed mobile data capabilities, rolling out
Ireland’s largest 5G network and expanding 4G coverage to 99% of the outdoor geography of Ireland.

**_Fixed line services_**

We are the largest provider of fixed line telecommunications services in Ireland, offering broadband,

voice, TV, datacomms and managed services to individual consumers and business users under the eir brand. We
also offer other authorized operators (“OAOs”) a range of wholesale services including high-speed broadband,
voice and managed services under our open eir brand. According to quarterly data published by ComReg (Source:
ComReg 24/44), we had a market share for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 of 37.9% of the Irish retail and
wholesale fixed line market, based on revenue. We have an extensive fixed line telecommunications network in
Ireland in terms of both capacity and geographic reach. We are also the leading provider of broadband services in
Ireland with 463,000 retail and 485,000 wholesale customers as of March 31, 2024, and an overall market share
of 27.9% of retail fixed broadband as of March 31, 2024. As of March 31, 2024, we had approximately 582,000


-----

access lines in service (including standalone broadband (“SABB”) and wholesale Local Loop Unbundling
(“LLU”)).

Revenue (before inter-segment eliminations) from our fixed line services was €962 million for the twelve

month period ended March 31, 2024. Adjusted EBITDA from our fixed line services was €476 million for the
twelve month period ended March 31, 2024.

**_Mobile services_**

We are the third largest mobile operator in Ireland in terms of revenue and customers. Our Mobile

division is comprised of both consumer and eir business mobile. According to data published by ComReg for the
quarter ended March 31, 2024, we had an overall mobile market share of 14.7% based on the number of
subscribers, including mobile broadband, a market principally comprised of three large players: Vodafone Ireland
Ltd (“Vodafone”), Three Ireland (Hutchinson) Limited (“Three”) and eir. Our strategy is to maximize customer
lifetime value within the mobile business whether through standalone propositions or bundling with fixed line
services.

As of March 31, 2024, approximately 78% of our customer base was in postpay contracts and the

remainder in prepay contracts. Revenue for our mobile division was €374 million for the twelve month period
ended March 31, 2024. Adjusted EBITDA of the mobile division was €163 million for the twelve month period
ended March 31, 2024. Adjusted EBITDA margin of the mobile division was 44% for the twelve month period
ended March 31, 2024.

**Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations**

**_Economic climate_**

Substantially all of our revenue is generated in Ireland and, as a result, our financial performance is

influenced by the strength of the Irish economy. Historically, in Ireland, the telecommunications sector has shown
a positive correlation with GDP.

Ireland has a healthy economy which in the recent past significantly outperformed the EU27 average,

growing at a 12.4% CAGR over 2019-2022, compared to the EU27 average CAGR of 4.3% for the same period.
In 2023, the Irish economy recorded a marginal GDP decline of 0.3%, compared to 6.6% growth for the EU27
and 7.2% growth for the UK in the same year. According to the European Economic Forecast – Spring 2024,
Ireland’s recent marginal economic contraction was primarily driven by the weak performance of specific
multinational-dominated sectors. Specifically, modified domestic demand, which better reflects the underlying
domestic economic activity, grew marginally by 0.5%, impacted by elevated inflation and tight financial
conditions. Preliminary GDP estimates show that the Irish economy has started to rebound, and GDP is expected
to grow by 1.2% in 2024 and by 3.6% in 2025 (Source: Eurostat, Spring European Economic Forecast 2024).
Irish unemployment continues to show significant improvement, having declined from the high levels of 15.5%
in 2012 during the economic downturn post the global financial crisis, down to 5.8% 6 years after in 2018, to
reach 4.3% in 2023 (Source: Eurostat). This is in line with the 2023 unemployment rate of 4.0% for the UK and
compares favorably to the EU27 average unemployment rate of 6.1% in 2023 (Source: Eurostat, Office for
National Statistics). Furthermore, 10-year Irish sovereign bond yields trade at approximately 2.6% versus
approximately 0% seven years ago (Source: Euronext Dublin website), reflecting the rebound in the Irish
economy. Ireland also benefits from having a young population relative to other European countries with a median
age of 39 years, compared to 45 years for EU27 and 41 years for the UK (as of 2022) (Source: Eurostat, Office
for National Statistics).

We believe that our results have been impacted and will continue to be impacted by the economic climate

in Ireland and, as such, our ability to continue to increase our revenue and profitability will depend, in part, on the
continued improvement of the Irish economy.

**_Changes in market dynamics_**

Fixed line telephony

Consistent with the experience of other fixed line operators in the industry, our revenue from fixed line

access and voice services has been, and we believe will continue to be, impacted by the substitution of fixed line
telephone services for mobile and OTT services, which has had a negative impact on our access and voice traffic
usage revenue.

All our fixed line OAO competitors in Ireland (other than Virgin Media) rely on our network to varying

degrees, which generates wholesale revenue for us. Consequently, despite the prevalence of retail competition,


-----

some of its impact is mitigated by the demand from OAOs for services offered by our wholesale division.
Operators such as Vodafone, BT (and, indirectly, Sky) and Three rely on our core and access networks for the
provision of services to their end-users and business customers. As a consequence, losses in our retail business to
OAOs may be offset by gains from our wholesale business. We do not, however, retain a portion of retail business
lost to mobile operators or Virgin Media, although, through our mobile business, we also secure a proportion of
traffic that is lost due to fixed-to-mobile substitution.

In order to address decreases in standalone retail voice traffic and retail access lines, we are continuing

to introduce new services for our fixed line subscribers, such as bundles that bring together high speed broadband,
voice calls, TV and mobile services.

Fixed line broadband

Growth in fixed broadband penetration is being driven by the demand for high-speed broadband services,

which continues to increase as consumption of services requiring high bandwidth broadband, such as OTT and
video streaming, increases. As a result, we expect the demand for high speed data to rise, which will drive further
take up of our high speed fiber services at both a retail and wholesale level. We will also continue to migrate our
existing customers to high speed broadband (eir Fibre) while simultaneously attracting new customers through
high-speed broadband capabilities and the provision of TV and bundled services. We believe the number of eir
Retail access lines will remain largely stable, driven by demand for broadband rather than fixed voice services.

Mobile

Mobile market growth is expected to be driven largely by structural factors including new services such

as B2B and M2M mobile services, growth in data consumption, bundled offerings and content. Accordingly,
mobile operators’ ability to increase their revenue, and defend and grow their subscriber base, will depend in large
part on their ability to retain existing customers, convince mobile users to switch from competing operators and
stimulate demand for new services, including 5G services.

Competition for customers among mobile communication providers is based principally upon the

services and features offered, technical quality of the mobile network and its coverage, customer service, capacity,
and increasing prices, with the introduction of growing numbers of packages bundling minutes, SMS and
broadband downloads. These factors have intensified the competitive environment and, coupled with the price
control of MTRs (enforced by ComReg), have had a negative impact on market ARPU’s in both the prepay and
postpay segments.

The Irish mobile telecommunications market continues to experience a trend in migration from prepay

to postpay contracts. Our postpay customer base has experienced strong growth: subscriber numbers (including
mobile broadband and M2M) were approximately 1,101,000 for the financial year ended December 31, 2023,
representing an increase of 12.1% or 119,000 net additional postpay subscribers compared to the financial year
ended December 31, 2022. For the financial year ended December 31, 2023, 77.3% of our mobile subscribers
were postpay customers, an increase from 74.6% for the financial year ended December 31, 2022. Growth in our
postpay base has been partly driven by prepay to postpay migrations and our roll-out of campaigns encouraging
postpay take up, specifically with mobile data offers.

The mobile prepay market in Ireland has been declining over the past few years, in part due to competitive

market conditions and also due to the aforementioned prepay to postpay migration, with prepay subscriptions
(excluding mobile broadband and M2M) falling from 27.7% of the total for the quarter ended December 31, 2022
to 25.1% for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 (Source: ComReg). Our mobile prepay customers (including
mobile broadband and M2M) for the financial year ended December 31, 2023 were 324,000, representing a
decrease of 3.0% compared to the financial year ended December 31, 2022.

**_Regulatory initiatives_**

Regulatory changes may result in a further decline in our fixed line market share in the future. In recent

years, ComReg has taken a number of measures designed to increase further the competition in the Irish
telecommunications market, which may result in further loss of our market share. These initiatives include, among
others:

##### • introducing obligations in the wholesale markets to provide wholesale services to OAOs;

 • applying cost orientation to the wholesale prices of our current generation services;

 • restricting the scope of bundled product offerings that we are permitted to make to our retail customers;


-----

##### • introducing price controls in regulated wholesale markets that also affect retail markets through
obligations not to cause a margin squeeze between retail and wholesale products, and price controls
requiring us not to cause a margin squeeze between combined wholesale services and the individual
components of these combined services;

##### • implementing obligations across the industry to facilitate customers who wish to change operators,
including enabling the porting of numbers in one working day; and

##### • chairing several industry fora, specific to developing regulated access products, including service level
agreements, which are attended by open eir (as the SMP operator), eir Retail and OAOs.

ComReg’s most recent review of the markets for WLA and WCA and for Physical Infrastructure Access

(“PIA”) were concluded in January 2024. While the market reviews reaffirmed that remain subject to _ex ante_
regulatory measures in the WLA market (subject to certain adjustments), the WCA market is no longer subject to
_ex ante regulation and the regulatory measures previously imposed in the WCA market no longer apply. In_
addition, ComReg found that we have significant market power in relation to the market for access to certain
physical infrastructure (such as poles and ducts) and has therefore maintained _ex ante regulation for access to_
those products and services.

**_Bundling_**

As a result of significant investment in our network, described below under “—Capital Expenditures and

_Investment,” we are well-positioned to offer bundles of telecommunications services. To retain and attract new_
customers, we offer initial promotional prices for bundles that include broadband, calls, TV and mobile. We
believe there are significant opportunities within the triple- and quad-play market and that our broad geographic
scope, the integrated nature of our network and our leading fixed line subscriber base will position us to compete
effectively in this market. As of December 31, 2023, 51% of eir’s consumer households were subscribed to three
or more services from eir’s offerings across broadband, mobile, TV and telephony, an increase of 6 percentage
points compared to December 31, 2022.

Our provision of services and our prices are subject to extensive regulation, including a price cap on

retail line rentals as well as the regulation of our wholesale prices, which typically must be cost oriented and must
not cause a margin squeeze against the underlying component inputs. Cost orientation for certain products and
services reflects the forward-looking incremental costs of an efficient operator, rather than the actual costs we
incurred.

**_Net impact of mobile substitution on our fixed line business_**

Like most fixed line telecommunications operators, our fixed line business is impacted by customers’

use of mobile devices as a substitute for our services, both voice and broadband. The increasing capability of
mobile networks will likely continue to have a negative impact on fixed line volumes and revenue. Through our
mobile business, we are, however, securing a proportion of traffic that is displaced from fixed to mobile.

We are continuing to introduce new service options for our customers, such as discount plans and value

added bundles that offer reduced prices or unlimited usage for certain categories of calls, reduced prices for fixedto-mobile calls and reduced costs for broadband within bundles, in order to make our services more attractive. We
highlight to customers the value of our fixed line services such as higher bandwidth broadband, as compared to
mobile.

**_Mobile termination rates (“MTR”)_**

While MTR reductions have the impact of decreasing our inbound revenue in the mobile business, it also

reduces our interconnect costs on both the fixed and mobile businesses and therefore the impact on EBITDA is
broadly neutral.

**_Capital Expenditures and Investment_**

We have undertaken an extensive capital expenditure program to modernize our business and address

recent trends in the telecommunications industry. Our capital expenditure program notably impacted our cash
flows for the financial years ended December 2022 and 2023 and for the three months ended March 31, 2024,
during which periods we invested €286 million, €349 million and €60 million, respectively, in our business. Our
capital expenditure over the last three years has related to the roll-out of our NGA fiber network, investments in
spectrum to roll-out 5G services and improve 4G coverage and capability, investments in new IT capabilities and


-----

TV, set-up of a new billing system which provides customers with a single bill for fixed and mobile products, and
general maintenance capital expenditure.

In May 2013, we launched high-speed broadband services over our NGA fiber network and now offer

speeds of up to 100 Mbps (for FTTC customers) and 1 Gb/s (for FTTH customers). By March 31, 2024, we
provided fiber-based services to customers through the deployment of a combination of FTTC and FTTH to over
approximately 2.1 million premises, or approximately 93% of the total in Ireland (including approximately 1.2
FTTH premises passed), connecting 42% of premises passed.

In February 2019, we announced the launch of “Ireland’s Fibre Network,” an ambitious plan to expand

our FTTH network to 1.4 million premises to suburban and urban areas across 180 towns and cities over a fiveyear period which commenced in September 2019. We are currently well underway in investing €500 million into
our FTTH program to pass 1.9 million premises across urban and suburban Ireland. As of March 31, 2024, we
passed 1.2 million premises. We are currently in the peak funding phase of the roll-out, which is expected to be
largely completed by 2027. We expect that our NGA fiber network will provide significant mobile backhaul
capacity to serve our mobile business and will also enable generation of incremental revenues by making our
network capacity available to other MNOs. The roll-out of our fiber network has been a key factor contributing
to our ability to attract and retain broadband customers and has also facilitated our bundled offerings, which
include fixed voice, broadband, TV and mobile.

In addition to the investments we have made in our NGA fiber network, we are continuing to invest in

our mobile network. In 2019, we launched GoMo, a new online SIM-only mobile network, as well as Ireland’s
largest and most technologically advanced 5G network, with 5G outdoor population coverage across 600 towns
and cities from 1,675 sites across all counties as of March 31, 2024. As of March 31, 2024, we have invested €250
million updating and expanding our mobile network, with a view to significantly increasing our high-speed mobile
data capabilities, rolling out Ireland’s largest 5G network and expanding 4G coverage to 99% of the outdoor
geography of Ireland, which we believe will make our network one of the most expansive in the world. The rollout of our 5G and 4G networks has helped to stabilize our ARPU as it has facilitated upselling of postpay packages
and driven increased data usage by our subscribers. As a result of these improvements in our services, we have
experienced a significant increase in mobile data traffic while our customers experience improved data speeds on
both 4G and 5G services. We intend to further increase our 4G and 5G population coverage and continue to invest
in improved customer experience on our network.

We have also made significant investments in our IPTV service, which was commercially launched in

2014 and subsequently upgraded through the launch of eir TV in October 2019, making us at present the only
provider with quad-play infrastructure enabling fixed voice, data, mobile and TV services in Ireland. Through eir
TV, we offer an innovative service that allows customers to watch up to 100 TV channels, through different digital
devices, which includes features such as 7-day catch-up, pause, rewind and start-over on selected shows, as well
as cloud recording on up to 500 programs.

As we complete our FTTH roll-out, we expect future associated network maintenance cost and capital

expenditure requirements to be meaningfully lower compared to traditional legacy copper networks.

**Key Factors Affecting the Comparability of our Results of Operations**

For purposes of our discussion below, we have presented our results of operations for the financial year

ended December 31, 2022 applying the proportionate method of accounting rather than the equity method of
accounting in reflecting Tetra’s results in our consolidated financial statements as we believe such a presentation
provides a more meaningful view of our results of operations and a consistent basis for comparing our results of
operations for the periods presented. We sold our majority interest in Tetra on March 23, 2022.

**_Financing activities_**

As of March 31, 2024, we had borrowings of €1,146 million under the Senior Facilities Agreement, with

€546 million Facility B borrowings having maturity date on May 15, 2026 and €600 million Facility B3
borrowings having maturity date on May 15, 2029. We also have €552 million 2026 Notes outstanding and
maturing May 15, 2026, €221 million 2024 Notes outstanding and maturing on November 1, 2024 and €281
million 2027 Notes outstanding and maturing on February 15, 2027.

In January 2024, we redeemed €1 million of the 2024 Notes.

In February 2024, we entered into additional €200 million borrowings maturing on May 15, 2026

pursuant to an additional facility under the Senior Facilities Agreement fungible with the existing Facility B.
During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we paid debt fees of €1 million in relation to such borrowings.


-----

In March 2024, we amended and extended €600 million of our Facility B borrowings, with original

maturity date on May 15, 2026. Under the terms of the amendment, €600 million borrowings were redesignated
as Facility B3 borrowings with maturity date extended by three years to May 15, 2029. The refinancing consisted
of approximately €445 million cashlessly rolled by lenders under the existing Facility B borrowings and
approximately €155 million in new commitments. The Facility B3 borrowings were issued at a discounted price
of 99.5% and are subject to cash-pay interest at EURIBOR plus 3.5% margin (subject to a margin ratchet as set
out in the Senior Facilities Agreement). During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we made a discount
payment of €3 million to the Facility B3 lenders and we paid debt modification fees of €2 million on the
borrowings.

As of March 31, 2024, our €50 million Revolving Credit Facility was undrawn.

As of March 31, 2024, FNI had Facility B borrowings of €765 million, with maturity date on June 30,

2029. FNI also had a Facility C commitment of €200 million, of which €45 million were drawn down as of March
31, 2024, with a maturity date of June 30, 2029, and a revolving credit facility of €35 million, which is undrawn
as of March 31, 2024.

Interest accrued on borrowings as of March 31, 2024 was €19 million compared to €11 million as of

December 31, 2023. This is reflected in trade and other payables.

During the financial year ended December 31, 2023, we prepaid €104 million of the principal amount of

the Facility B borrowings due 2026, compared to a prepayment of €50 million during the financial year ended
December 31, 2022. The prepayment of Facility B borrowings was accounted for as an extinguishment of debt
and resulted in an accounting gain of €2 million in the income statement within “finance income” compared to a
gain of €3 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2022.

On June 30, 2022, FNI entered into new Facility B borrowings of €765 million under the FNI Facilities

Agreement, with maturity date on June 30, 2029. We deferred €18 million of transaction costs directly attributable
to these borrowings to the balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. These costs will be amortized over the expected
life of the borrowings through finance costs in the income statement using the effective interest method under
IFRS 9.

and further operating expenses.

_Depreciation_

Our annual depreciation charge depends primarily on the estimated lives of each type of asset and, in

certain circumstances, estimates of fair values and residual values. Long-life assets, consisting primarily of
property, plant and equipment, comprise a significant portion of the total assets. Asset lives are regularly reviewed
and changed as necessary to reflect current thinking on remaining lives in light of technological change,
prospective economic utilization, physical condition of the assets concerned and other factors that may impact on
the remaining useful lives of assets.

_Amortization_

Amortization charge is dependent on the estimated lives allocated to each type of intangible asset. The

asset lives are regularly reviewed and changed as necessary to reflect current thinking on remaining lives and the
expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset.

_Tax expense_

Tax expense is the aggregate amount included in the determination of profit or loss for the period in

respect of current tax and deferred tax. Current tax is the amount of income taxes payable or recoverable in respect
of the taxable profit or tax loss for a period. Deferred tax is the amount of income tax payable or recoverable in
future periods in respect of taxable or deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses and unused tax credits.

WLR PSTN ARPU[(2)] ............... 16.9 16.9 —

Bitstream ARPU (including SABB)[ (3)] 17.9 20.8 16%

___________________

- All Fixed ARPUs are adjusted to reflect the average number of days in a month.

** The average number of subscribers in a month as the average of the total number of subscribers at the beginning of the month and the total
number of subscribers at the end of the month.

(1) We define “Blended Consumer Fixed ARPU” as the average of the total consumer subscriber revenue divided by the average
number of access subscribers (including SABB) in each month. Subscriber revenue is equal to total fixed line consumer
revenue excluding revenue from Operator Services.

(2) We define “WLR PSTN ARPU” as the average of Wholesale PSTN line rental revenue divided by the average number of
PSTN WLR access subscribers in each month.

(3) We define “Bitstream ARPU” as the average of bitstream rental revenue including SABB (recurring revenue) divided by the
average number of Wholesale bitstream (including SABB) subscribers in each month.

The consumer blended ARPU remained largely stable, increasing by 1% from 46.9 for the three months

ended March 31, 2023 to 47.5 for the three months ended March 31, 2024

The WLR PSTN ARPU for the three months ended March 31, 2024 remained stable compared to the

WLR PSTN ARPU for three months ended March 31, 2023.

The bitstream ARPU (including SABB) increased by 16% from 17.9 for the three months ended March

31, 2023 to 20.8 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, primarily due to an increase in the proportion of the
bitstream base on standalone broadband.

**_Fixed line services and other revenue_**

Total fixed line services and other revenue before intra-company eliminations decreased by €1 million

from €232 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to €231 million for the three months ended March


-----

31, 2024. The decrease was driven by a 21% decline in voice traffic partially offset by an 8% increase in access
revenue.

Total access revenues decreased by 8%, or €7 million, from €88 million for the three months ended

March 31, 2023 to €95 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, primarily for the reasons discussed
below.

Retail PSTN/ISDN line rental and connection revenue decreased by 10% from €38 million for the three

months ended March 31, 2023 to €34 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, primarily due to changes
in allocation of discounts on bundles between access and broadband. Retail access lines were 567,000 as of March
31, 2024, remaining stable compared to March 31, 2023.

Wholesale PSTN/ISDN/LLU rental and connection revenue decreased by 24% from €17 million for the

three months ended March 31, 2023 to €13 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, primarily due to
a decline in wholesale access lines in the same period. Wholesale access lines were 224,000 as of March 31, 2024,
a decrease of 26% compared to March 31, 2023.

Broadband rental and connection revenue increased by 45% from €33 million for the three months ended

March 31, 2023 to €48 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, primarily due to an increase in SABB
in the same period. The number of SABB increased by 15% from 322,000 as of March 31, 2023 to 371,000 as of
March 31, 2024. In addition, our total broadband customer base increased by 2,000 customers from 946,000
customers as of March 31, 2023 to 948,000 customers as of March 31, 2024, with retail broadband customers
increasing by 4%, partially offset by wholesale broadband customers decreasing by 3%.

We are committed to growing our broadband reach and have invested in our FTTH Program to rollout

fiber to 1.2 million premises, providing our customers with reliable and uncongested speeds of up to 1000mbs.


-----

As of March 31, 2024, we passed 2.1 million premises with FTTH, an increase of 18%, or 190,000 premises,
compared to March 31, 2023. Our fiber customer base increased by 3%, or 28,000 customers, to 873,000
customers as of March 31, 2024 compared to 845,000 customers as of March 31, 2023, primarily due to an increase
in FTTH connections.

_Traffic_

The following table shows information relating to our total traffic revenue and volumes, and the

percentage change for the periods indicated:

**For the three months ended March 31,** **% Change**

Overall traffic revenue increased by 21%, or €10 million, to €36 million for the three months ended

March 31, 2024 from €46 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, primarily due to a decline of 36%
in retail traffic minutes in the same period. Wholesale voice traffic revenue decreased by 27%, or €1 million, to
€4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 from €5 million for the three months ended March 31,

**Total subscribers ...................................................................................** **1,339** **1,451** **8%**

Mobile services revenue comprises prepay and postpay revenues, mobile broadband and foreign roaming

revenue. Other revenue is derived mainly from device sales.

Mobile services revenue increased by 8%, or €7 million, from €82 million for the three months ended

March 31, 2023 to €89 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024.

Prepay handset revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2024 remained stable at €16 million

compared to prepay handset revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2024, despite a decrease in prepay
handset customers of 2%, or 9,000 customers in the same period. This decrease was offset by changes in our
customer base mix, with a shift from our prepay to our postpay services primarily driven by GoMo, our SIM only
postpay offering. Accordingly, postpay handset revenue increased by 10%, or €4 million, from €47 million for
the three months ended March 31, 2023 to €51 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, primarily
driven by an increase in postpay handset customers (including M2M) of 12%, or 115,000 customers, in the same
period.


-----

Mobile broadband revenue increased by 15%, or €1 million, from €3 million for the three months ended

March 31, 2023 to €4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, primarily driven by an increase of 10%
or 6,000 customers, in our mobile broadband customer base.

Roaming revenue increased by 88%, or €2 million, from €2 million for the three months ended March

31, 2023 to €4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024.

Other revenue remained stable at €14 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and the three

months ended March 31, 2023.

As of March 31, 2024, we had a total of 1,451,000 mobile subscribers, an increase of 8% compared to

the total number of subscribers as of March 31, 2023. The mix of customers continues to improve, with 120,000
net additional postpay customers (including mobile broadband and M2M customers) in the twelve months ended
March 31, 2024, resulting in 78% of our customers being postpay customers (including mobile broadband
customers and M2M), an increase of 3% compared to the proportion as of March 31, 2023.

_Mobile ARPU_

The following table shows the average revenue per user (ARPU):

**For the three months ended March 31,** **% Change**

**(€ per month)** **2023** **2024** **2023/2024**

Prepay ARPU (including MBB)[(1)] ............... 15.8 16.4 4%

Postpay ARPU (including MBB/M2M)[(2)] .... 19.1 18.8 (2%)

**Total ARPU[(3)] .............................................** **18.3** **18.2** **—**

___________________

** The average number of subscribers in a month as the average of the total number of subscribers at the beginning of the month and the total
number of subscribers at the end of the month.

(1) We define “Prepay ARPU” as the measure of the sum of the total prepay mobile subscriber revenue including revenue from
incoming traffic in a period divided by the average number of prepay mobile subscribers in the period divided by the number
of months in the period.

(2) We define “Postpay ARPU” as the measure of the sum of the total postpay mobile subscriber revenue including revenue
from incoming traffic in a period divided by the average number of postpay mobile subscribers in the period divided by the
number of months in the period.

(3) We define “Total ARPU” as the total mobile subscriber revenue in a period divided by the average number of mobile
subscribers in the period divided by the number of months in the period.

Our total ARPU at €18.2 per month for the three months ended March 31, 2024 remained stable

compared to the total ARPU for the three months ended March 31, 2023.

Our prepay ARPU (including MBB) at €16.4 per month for the three months ended March 31, 2024

marginally increased from €15.8 per month for the three months ended March 31, 2023, driven mainly by higher
usage.

Our postpay ARPU (including MBB/M2M) at €18.8 per month for the three months ended March 31,

2024 marginally decreased from €19.1 per month for the three months ended March 31, 2023, driven mainly by
product mix changes.

_Mobile Churn_

The table below sets forth our postpaid and prepaid monthly mobile churn rates for the periods indicated:

**For the three months ended March 31,** **% Change**

Postpay Churn rate (%) . ................................ 0.8 0.9 12.5

Prepay Churn rate (%) . ................................. 3.2 3.4 6.3

Postpay churn remained largely stable, marginally increasing to 0.9% for the three months ended March

31, 2024 compared to 0.8% the three months ended March 31, 2024. Prepay churn increased to 3.4% for the three
months ended March 31, 2024 from 3.2% for the three months ended March 31, 2023, primarily due to the market
trend in migration from prepay to postpay contracts.

items increased by 2%, or €3 million, from €160 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to
€163 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024.

We have discussed below, the key factors affecting the changes in the various items making up our

operating costs excluding amortization, depreciation and exceptional items.

_Cost of sales_

Cost of sales decreased by 8%, or €6 million, from €71 million for the three months ended March 31,

2023 to €65 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Foreign outpayments decreased by 50%, or
€1 million, from €2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to €1 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2024. Interconnect payments to other telecommunications operators decreased by 13%, or €1 million,
from €8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to €7 million for the three months ended March 31,
2024. Equipment cost of sales decreased by 12%, or €1 million, from €14 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2023 to €13 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Subsidiaries increased by 11%, or
€2 million, from €23 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to €25 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2024, mainly driven by eir Evo costs relating to large one-off sales. Other cost of sales decreased by
21%, or €5 million, from €24 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to €19 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2024.


-----

_Pay costs_

Total pay costs before non-cash pension charges for the three months ended March 31, 2024 remained

stable at €46 million compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023. FTE headcount decreased by 233 FTE,
from 3,469 FTE as of March 31, 2023 to 3,236 FTE as of March 31, 2024.

_Non-pay costs_

Total non-pay costs increased by 16%, or €7 million, from €43 million for the three months ended March

31, 2023 to €50 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. This was primarily driven by increases in
sales and marketing costs by 33%, or €1 million, primarily due to the commercial decision to drive revenue from
marketing investment, and accommodation costs by 5%, or €1 million, primarily due to an increase in rent and
facility costs. The remaining costs for the period were broadly stable.

_Non-cash pension charge_

The non-cash pension charge represents the difference between the amount of cash contributions that we

have agreed to make to the fund during the period, on an accruals basis, and the accounting charges recognized in
operating profit in accordance with IAS 19 (Revised). The IAS 19 (Revised) accounting charge is not aligned with
the principles that we apply in measuring our EBITDA. As a result, we include the non-cash pension charge as an
adjustment to our EBITDA. See “Summary—Summary Historical Financial Data.”

_Non-cash lease fair value credits_

The non-cash lease fair value credit included in our income statement during the period is in respect of

the unfavorable lease fair value adjustment which arose on acquisition of eircom Limited. At the date of
acquisition, we were required to recognize a liability for the difference between the amount of future rental
payments that had been contractually committed to and the market rent that would have been payable if those
contracts had been entered into at that date. The liability is released as a credit to the income statement over the
period of the relevant leases. The IFRS accounting treatment is not aligned with the principles we apply in
measuring our EBITDA. As a result, non-cash lease fair value credit is included as an adjustment to our EBITDA.
See “Summary—Summary Historical Financial Data.”

**_Amortization_**

Amortization charges increased by 9%, or €1 million, from €11 million for the three months ended March

31, 2023 to €12 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, due to higher amortization on our computer
software and 5G license.

**_Depreciation_**

Depreciation charges on property, plant and equipment decreased by 7%, or €4 million, from €60 million

for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to €56 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The
decrease is mainly due to lower depreciation on property and mobile assets and lower fair value depreciation
adjustment relating to the acquisition of eircom Limited assets in 2012.

**_Depreciation of right of use assets_**

Depreciation charges on right of use assets decreased by 15%, or €2 million, from €13 million for the

three months ended March 31, 2023 to €11 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, mainly due to
lower depreciation on leased property assets.

**_Exceptional Items_**

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, our exceptional charge of €2 million included €1 million

for restructuring program costs and €1 million for certain legal matters arising in the period. The €4 million
exceptional charge sustained in the three months ended March 31, 2023 was for restructuring program costs,
reflecting redundancy costs payable to staff who had either exited the business, or were committed to exiting the
business as of March 31, 2023.

**_Finance costs (net)_**

Net finance costs increased by 74%, or €20 million, from €27 million for the three months ended March

31, 2023 to €47 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase is mainly due to an increase of
€7 million in interest costs on borrowings, as well as a €4 million loss on modification of debt as a result of the
three years maturity extension of €600 million of our Facility B borrowings which was completed in March 2024


-----

at higher margin compared to the existing Facility B borrowings due 2026, a discount payment of €3 million paid
to Facility B3 lenders on the above mentioned amendment and extension of debt, lower redemption discounts on
the Existing Notes of €3 million and higher interest cost on net pension assets of €3 million.

**_Taxation_**

The tax charge for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was €4 million compared to €6 million for

the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease is mainly due to the prior year’s income being taxable at a
higher rate of €2 million relating to capital gains tax on property disposals in the period.

**Results of operations for the financial year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the financial year ended**

**_Revenue_**

Revenue increased by 5%, or €62 million, from €1,230 million for the financial year ended December

31, 2022 to €1,292 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2023. On an adjusted basis (accounting for
Tetra’s results on a proportionate basis), the increase was of €58 million from €1,234 million for the financial year
ended December 31, 2022 to €1,292 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2023.

The following discussion is based on our adjusted results, which reflects Tetra’s results applying the

proportionate consolidation method of accounting rather than the equity method as required under IFRS 11.

**_Fixed line services_**

The following table shows Consumer Blended ARPU, WLR PSTN ARPU, bitstream ARPU (including

SABB) relating to our business for the periods indicated:

_Fixed ARPU_

**For the financial year ended December 31,** **% Change**

**(€ per month, except percentages)** **2022** **2023** **2022/ 2023**

Blended Consumer Fixed ARPU[(1)] 48.8 48.3 (1%)

WLR PSTN ARPU[(2)] ............... 16.5 16.3 (1%)

Bitstream ARPU (including SABB)[ (3)] 17.0 19.8 16%

____________________

- All Fixed ARPUs are adjusted to reflect the average number of days in a month.

** The average number of subscribers in a month as the average of the total number of subscribers at the beginning of the month and the total
number of subscribers at the end of the month.

(1) We define “Blended Consumer Fixed ARPU” as the average of the total consumer subscriber revenue divided by the average
number of access subscribers (including SABB) in each month. Subscriber revenue is equal to total fixed line consumer
revenue excluding revenue from Operator Services.

(2) We define “WLR PSTN ARPU” as the average of Wholesale PSTN line rental revenue divided by the average number of
PSTN WLR access subscribers in each month.

(3) We define “Bitstream ARPU” as the average of bitstream rental revenue including SABB (recurring revenue) divided by the
average number of Wholesale bitstream (including SABB) subscribers in each month.

The consumer blended ARPU decreased from €48.8 per month for the financial year ended December

31, 2022 to €48.3 per month for the financial year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to a decline in outof-bundle usage and retention discounting.

The WLR PSTN ARPU for the financial year ended December 31, 2023 remained stable compared to

the WLR PSTN ARPU for the financial year ended December 31, 2022.

The bitstream ARPU (including SABB) increased by 16% from €17.0 per month for the financial year

ended December 31, 2022 to €19.8 per month for the financial year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to
an increase in the proportion of the bitstream base on standalone broadband.

**_Fixed line services and other revenue_**

Total fixed line services and other revenue before intra-company eliminations increased by 2%, or

€18 million, from €945 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2022 to €963 million for the financial
year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was driven by a 15% increase in voice traffic revenue and an 11%
increase in other products and services revenue, largely offset by a 12% decrease in access revenue.

The following table shows our revenue from the fixed line segment, analyzed by major products and

services, and the percentage change for each category, for the periods indicated:

**For the financial year ended December 31,** **% Change**

**Total Broadband ....................** **953** **950** **—**

Total access revenues decreased by 12%, or €45 million, from €387 million for the financial year ended

December 31, 2022 to €342 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to the reasons
discussed below.

Retail PSTN/ISDN line rental and connection revenue decreased by 13% from €159 million for the

financial year ended December 31, 2022 to €139 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2023, despite
a slight increase in retail PSTN and ISDN access lines in the same period, primarily due to changes in the
allocation of discounts on bundles between access and broadband. Retail Access lines were 568,000 as of
December 31, 2023, an increase of 1% compared to December 31, 2022.

Wholesale PSTN/ISDN/LLU rental and connection revenue decreased by 20% from €78 million for the

financial year ended December 31, 2022 to €62 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2023, primarily
due to a decline in wholesale access lines in the same period. Wholesale access lines were 242,000 as of December
31, 2023, a decrease of 26% as compared to December 31, 2022.

Broadband rental and connection revenue decreased by 6% from €150 million for the financial year

ended December 31, 2022 to €141 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to a
decrease in our wholesale broadband base. Our total broadband customer base decreased by 3,000 customers from
953,000 customers as of December 31, 2022 to 950,000 customers as of December 31, 2023, due to wholesale
broadband customers decreasing by 4%, partially offset by retail broadband customers increasing by 4%.

We continue to address retail fixed line losses and broadband churn with a number of programs, including

rolling out high speed broadband and offering bundled telecommunications services including mobile and TV. As
of December 31, 2023, the roll-out of our high-speed fiber network had passed over approximately 2.1 million
Irish premises, with over 869,000 retail and wholesale customers connected to fiber broadband services. As of
December 31, 2023, 51% of our consumer households were subscribed to three or more services from our
offerings across broadband, mobile, TV and telephony, an increase of 6% compared to December 31, 2022.

_Traffic_

The following table shows information relating to our total traffic revenue and volumes, and the

percentage change for the periods indicated:

**For the financial year ended December 31,** **% Change**

Overall traffic revenue increased by 15%, or €26 million, to €198 million for the financial year ended

December 31, 2023 from €172 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to an
increase in retail voice traffic revenue, partially offset by a decrease in wholesale voice traffic revenue. Retail
voice traffic revenue increased by 19%, or €28 million, to €178 million for the financial year ended December 31,


-----

2023 from €150 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2022, notwithstanding a decline of 28% in
retail traffic minutes in the same period. Wholesale voice traffic revenue decreased by 9%, or €2 million, to
€20 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2023 from €22 million for the financial year ended
December 31, 2022, primarily due to a decline of 20% in wholesale traffic minutes in the same period.

Switched data .......................... 9 6 (33%)

Next generation data

services .............................. 39 53 36%

**Total data communications revenue** **114** **120** **5%**

Revenue from data communications increased by 5%, or €6 million, to €120 million for the financial

year ended December 31, 2023 from €114 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due
to a 36% increase in revenue from next generation data services, largely offset by a 33% decrease in revenue from
switched data services.

_Other products and services_

Other products and services revenue includes our 56% share of revenue from Tetra (net of consolidation

eliminations), Eir Evo revenue, revenue from our operations in the UK, managed services, national broadband
access services, TV and content services, data centers and other revenue.

Revenue from other products and services increased by 11%, or €31 million, from €272 million for the

financial year ended December 31, 2022 to €303 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2023,
primarily due to a 24%, or €28 million, increase in Eir Evo revenue, partially offset by a €5 million decrease in
Tetra revenue as a result of the sale of our shareholding in Tetra in March 2022 and a €11 million decrease in
other revenue, which includes property income and other miscellaneous revenues, in each case in the same period.

In contrast, access rental revenues in supply to the NBP increased by 37%, or €9 million, from

€25 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2022 to €34 million for the financial year ended December
31, 2023, primarily due to a continuous growth in demand for these services. Managed services revenue also
increased by 23%, or €10 million, in the same period, primarily due to customer growth.

Revenue from our operations in the UK, data center revenue and TV and content revenue for the financial

year ended December 31, 2023 remained stable compared to corresponding revenue generated in the financial
year ended December 31, 2022.

Mobile services revenue comprises prepay and postpay revenues, mobile broadband and foreign roaming

revenue. Other revenue is derived mainly from device sales.

Mobile services revenue increased by 13%, or €41 million, from €326 million for the financial year ended

December 31, 2022 to €367 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2023.

Prepay handset revenue for the financial year ended December 31, 2023 remained stable at €64 million

compared to prepay handset revenue for the financial year ended December 31, 2022, while postpay handset
revenue increased by 14%, or €25 million, from €175 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2022 to
€200 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to an increase in postpay handset
customers (including M2M) of 12%, or 113,000 customers, in the same period. GoMo, our SIM only postpay
offering, has been the principal driver of the change in our customer base mix.

Mobile broadband revenue increased by 25%, or €3 million, from €12 million for the financial year ended

December 31, 2022 to €15 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2023, primarily driven by an increase
of 12% or 7,000 customers, in our mobile broadband customer base.

Roaming revenue increased by 42%, or €5 million, from €12 million for the financial year ended

December 31, 2022 to €17 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2023, and other mobile revenue
increased by 13%, or €8 million, from €63 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2022 to €71 million
for the financial year ended December 31, 2023.

As of December 31, 2023, we had a total of 1,425,000 mobile subscribers, an increase of 8% compared

to the total number of subscribers as of December 31, 2022. The mix of customers continues to improve, with
113,000 net additional postpay customers (including mobile broadband and M2M customers) in the financial year
ended December 31, 2023, resulting in 77% of our customers being postpay customers (including mobile
broadband customers and M2M), an increase of 2% compared to the proportion as of December 31, 2022.

_Mobile ARPU_

The following table shows the average revenue per user (ARPU):

**For the financial year ended December 31,** **% Change**

**(€ per month)** **2022** **2023** **2022/ 2023**

Prepay ARPU (including MBB)[(1)] ............... 15.9 16.0 1%

Postpay ARPU (including MBB/M2M)[(2)] .... 19.4 19.4 **—**

**Total ARPU[(3)] .............................................** **18.4** **18.6** **1%**

____________________

** The average number of subscribers in a month as the average of the total number of subscribers at the beginning of the month and the total
number of subscribers at the end of the month.


-----

(1) We define “Prepay ARPU” as the measure of the sum of the total prepay mobile subscriber revenue including revenue from

incoming traffic in a year divided by the average number of prepay mobile subscribers in the period divided by the number of months in the
year.

(2) We define “Postpay ARPU” as the measure of the sum of the total postpay mobile subscriber revenue including revenue

from incoming traffic in a year divided by the average number of postpay mobile subscribers in the period divided by the number of months
in the year.

(3) We define “Total ARPU” as the total mobile subscriber revenue in a period divided by the average number of mobile

subscribers in the year divided by the number of months in the year.

Our total ARPU at €18.6 per month for the financial year ended December 31, 2023 marginally increased

from €18.4 per month for the financial year ended December 31, 2022, driven mainly by a change to the mobile
customer base mix, with increased postpay subscribers.

Our prepay ARPU (including MBB) at €16.0 per month for the financial year ended December 31, 2023

marginally increased from €15.9 per month for the financial year ended December 31, 2022, driven mainly by
increased usage.

Our postpay ARPU (including MBB/M2M) at €19.4 per month for the financial year ended December

31, 2023 is stable when compared to ARPU for the financial year ended December 31, 2022.

_Mobile Churn_

The table below sets forth our postpaid and prepaid annualized mobile churn rates for the periods

indicated:

**For the financial year ended December**

**31,** **% Change**

Postpay Churn rate (%) . ................................ 1.0 1.0 **—**

Prepay Churn rate (%) . ................................. 3.6 3.7 2.8%

Postpay churn for the financial year ended December 31, 2023 remained stable at 1.0% compared to

postpay churn for the financial year ended December 31, 2022. Prepay churn marginally increased to 3.7% for the
financial year ended December 31, 2023 from 3.6% for the financial year ended December 31, 2022, primarily
due to the market trend in migration from prepay to postpay contracts.

Operating costs excluding non-cash pension charge, amortization, depreciation of PPE and exceptional

items increased by 12%, or €72 million, from €594 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2022 to
€666 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2023.

We have discussed below, the key factors affecting the changes in the various items making up our

operating costs excluding amortization, depreciation and exceptional items.

_Cost of sales_

Cost of sales increased by 22%, or €55 million, from €251 million for the financial year ended December

31, 2022 to €306 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2023. Foreign outpayments for the financial
year ended December 31, 2023 remained stable at €6 million compared to foreign outpayments for the financial
year ended December 31, 2022. Interconnect payments to other telecommunications operators increased by 15%,
or €5 million, from €33 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2022 to €38 million for the financial
year ended December 31, 2023. Equipment cost of sales increased by 10%, or €5 million, from €51 million for
the financial year ended December 31, 2022 to €56 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2023.
Subsidiaries increased by 33%, or €26 million, from €78 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2022
to €104 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2023. Other cost of sales increased by 23%, or €19
million, from €83 million the financial year ended December 31, 2022 to €102 million for the financial year ended
December 31, 2023, primarily due to an increase in managed services and National Broadband access revenues.

_Pay costs_

Total pay costs before non-cash pension charges decreased by 2%, or €3 million, from €184 million for

the financial year ended December 31, 2022 to €181 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2023, due
to a decrease in FTE headcount in the same period. FTE headcount decreased by 7%, or 255 FTE, from 3,425
FTE as of December 31, 2022 to 3,170 FTE as of December 31, 2023.


-----

_Non-pay costs_

Total non-pay costs increased by 17%, or €25 million, from €147 million for the financial year ended

December 31, 2022 to €172 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2023 . This was primarily driven
by increases in accommodation costs by 12%, or €7 million, material and services costs and sales and marketing
costs, each by 40%, or €4 million, and provision for credit losses by 57%, or €4 million.

_Non-cash pension charge_

The non-cash pension charge represents the difference between the amount of cash contributions that we

have agreed to make to the fund during the year, on an accruals basis, and the accounting charges recognized in
operating profit in accordance with IAS 19 (Revised). The IAS 19 (Revised) accounting charge is not aligned with
the principles that we apply in measuring our EBITDA. As a result, we include the non-cash pension charge as an
adjustment to our EBITDA. See “Summary—Summary Historical Financial Data.”

_Non-cash lease fair value credits_

The non-cash lease fair value credit included in the income statement during the period is in respect of

the unfavorable lease fair value adjustment which arose on acquisition of eircom Limited. At the date of
acquisition, we were required to recognize a liability for the difference between the amount of future rental
payments that had been contractually committed to and the market rent that would have been payable if those
contracts had been entered into at that date. The liability is released as a credit to the income statement over the
period of the relevant leases. The IFRS accounting treatment is not aligned with the principles we apply in
measuring our EBITDA. As a result, non-cash lease fair value credit is included as an adjustment to our EBITDA.
See “Summary—Summary Historical Financial Data.”

**_Amortization_**

Amortization charges increased by 12%, or €5 million, from €43 million for the financial year ended

December 31, 2022 to €48 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2023, due to higher amortization on
computer software and the new 5G license that was acquired in 2023.

**_Depreciation_**

Depreciation charges on property, plant and equipment increased by 1%, or €3 million, from

€243 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2022 to €246 million for the financial year ended
December 31, 2023.

Adjustments to depreciation based on changes to our accounting policy for joint venture arrangement

were immaterial.

**_Depreciation of right of use assets_**

Depreciation charges on right of use assets decreased by 6%, or €3 million, from €50 million or the

financial year ended December 31, 2022 to €47 million or the financial year ended December 31, 2023, mainly
due to lower depreciation on leased property assets.

**_Exceptional Items_**

For the financial year ended December 31, 2023, our exceptional charge of €49 million included

€1 million for onerous contracts on leasehold properties, €22 million for restructuring program costs, €3 million
for strategic related costs, €4 million for group reorganization costs and €19 million for certain legal matters
arising in the year.

For the financial year ended December 31, 2022, our exceptional charge of €208 million included €151

million for strategic related costs, €25 million for restructuring program costs, €5 million for group reorganization
costs, €1 million for Covid-19 related costs, €1 million for onerous contracts and €25 million for legal and other
matters arising in the year. The €151 million for strategic related costs mainly relates to a stamp duty of €138
million that was paid to the Irish Revenue (tax authority) following the sale of the fiber business and assets to our
subsidiary, FNI. During the financial year ended December 31, 2022, we also incurred various other costs in
relation to such sale.

**_Finance costs (net)_**

Net finance costs increased by 49%, or €42 million, from €85 million for the financial year ended

December 31, 2022 to €127 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2023. The increase is mainly due


-----

to an increase of €24 million in interest costs on the FNI borrowings and of €27 million on the Facility B
borrowings due 2026, partially offset by a decrease of €9 million in interest costs on the Existing Notes. During
the financial year ended December 31, 2023, we repurchased some of the Existing Notes, with lower redemption
discounts of €25 million compared to the prior year, offset by a decrease of €26 million in interest costs on net
pension assets in the same period.

**_Taxation_**

The tax charge for the financial year ended December 31, 2023 was €17 million, which is in line with

the tax charge of €17 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2022.

**Liquidity**

**_Net cash generated from operating activities_**

Net cash generated from operating activities decreased by 42%, or €8 million, from €19 million for the

three months ended March 31, 2023 to €11 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, due to an increase
of €8 million in interest payments on borrowings in the same period.

Net cash generated from operating activities increased by 40%, or €113 million, from €279 million for

the financial year ended December 31, 2022 to €392 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2023,
mainly due to a decrease of €141 million in exceptional payments from €170 million in the financial year ended
December 31, 2022 to €29 million in the financial year ended December 31, 2023 and a decrease of €21 million
in tax payments from €43 million in the financial year ended December 31, 2022 to €22 million in the financial
year ended December 31, 2023, offset by an increase of €48 million in interest payments on bank borrowings in
the same period. The exceptional payments made in the financial year ended 2022 included a stamp duty payment
of €138 million to the Irish Revenue (tax authority) following the sale of the fiber business and assets to our
subsidiary, Fibre Networks Ireland Limited (“FNI”).

**_Cash flows from investing activities_**

Total cash used in investing activities increased by 20%, or €15 million, from €75 million for the three

months ended March 31, 2023 to €90 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. For the three months
ended March 31, 2024, we made payments for capital expenditure (cash) of €90 million, an increase of €6 million
compared to capital expenditure (cash) of €84 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023.

In addition, during the three months ended March 31, 2023, we sold a number of properties and, after

allowance for certain costs relating to the disposals, we received net proceeds of €9 million.

Total cash used in investing activities increased by 4%, or €11 million, from €264 million for the financial

year ended December 31, 2022 to €275 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2023. For financial
year ended December 31, 2023, we made payments for capital expenditure (cash) of €347 million, an increase of
€60 million compared to capital expenditure (cash) of €287 million for the financial year ended December 31,
2022.The increase is mainly due to the acquisition of additional 5G spectrum licenses from ComReg in the recent
Multi Band Spectrum Award process. The restricted cash deposit of €55 million placed with ComReg during the
financial year ended December 31, 2022 in relation to the Multi Band Spectrum Auction was released during the
financial year ended December 31, 2023.

In addition, during the financial year ended December 31, 2023, we sold a number of properties and,

after allowance for certain costs relating to the disposals, we received net proceeds of €17 million. In March 2022,
we sold our majority stake in Tetra, for which we received proceeds of €76 million.

**_Cash flows from financing activities_**

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we made dividend distributions to our equity

shareholder, Wexford Limited, of €50 million.

Our principal payments on lease liabilities decreased by 44%, or €11 million, from €25 million for the

three months ended March 31, 2023 to €14 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, mainly due to the
timing of payments on leased property and masts site access.

In February 2024, we entered into additional €200 million borrowings maturing on May 15, 2026

pursuant to an additional facility under the Senior Facilities Agreement fungible with the existing Facility B.
During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we paid debt fees of €1 million in relation to such borrowings.


-----

In March 2024, we amended and extended €600 million of our Facility B borrowings, with original

maturity date on May 15, 2026. Under the terms of the amendment, €600 million borrowings were redesignated
as Facility B3 borrowings with maturity date extended by three years to May 15, 2029. The refinancing consisted
of approximately €445 million cashlessly rolled by lenders under the existing Facility B borrowings and
approximately €155 million in new commitments. The Facility B3 borrowings were issued at a discounted price
of 99.5% and are subject to cash-pay interest at EURIBOR plus 3.5% margin (subject to a margin ratchet as set
out in the Senior Facilities Agreement). During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we made a discount
payment of €3 million to the Facility B3 lenders and we paid debt modification fees of €2 million on the
borrowings.

In addition, during the three months ended March 31, 2024, we made cash payments of €1 million on the

2024 Notes.

During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we made cash payments of €11 million on the Facility

B borrowings due 2026, €35 million on the 3.5% 2026 Notes and €22 million on the 2024 Notes.

During the financial year ended December 31, 2023, we made dividend distributions to our equity

shareholder, Wexford Limited, of €200 million, and to InfraVia of €37 million.

Our principal payments on lease liabilities increased by 17%, or €8 million, from €47 million for the

financial year ended December 31, 2022 to €55 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2023, mainly
to higher payments on leased property.

During the financial year ended December 31, 2023, FNI drew down €45 million of its Facility C

borrowings and we made cash payments of €102 million on the Facility B borrowings due 2026, €36 million on
the 2026 Notes and €57 million on the 2024 Notes.

During the financial year ended December 31, 2022, we made dividend distributions to our equity

shareholder, Wexford Limited, of €800 million.

During the financial year ended December 31, 2022, we sold a minority stake in our subsidiary, FNI, to

InfraVia and, after allowance for certain costs relating to the disposals, we received proceeds of €624 million.
During the same year, FNI entered into Facility B borrowings of €765 million under the Senior Facilities
Agreement and debt fees of €18 million were paid in relation to such borrowings. In addition, we made cash
payments of €47 million on the Facility B borrowings due 2026, €144 million on the 2026 Notes, €69 million on
the 2024 Notes and €59 million on the 2027 Notes (debt purchased below par).

**_Capital resources_**

Liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash

requirements of its business operations, including working capital needs, capital expenditures, debt service
obligations, other commitments, contractual obligations and acquisitions. Our primary sources of liquidity have
been and will be cash flow generation from our operations and permitted borrowings, including the Revolving
Facility and the issuances of debt securities, as well as the potential sale of non-core assets. We believe that we
have sufficient liquidity to meet the cash requirements of our business operations.

**Capital Expenditures and Investments**

The following table shows our incurred capital expenditures including non-cash pension charges defined

as additions of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets for the periods indicated.

**(€ in millions)** **2022** **2023** **2023** **2024**

**Total capital expenditure .........................................................................** **286** **349** **67** **61**

Growth capital expenditure includes our major capital investment to roll-out our nationwide fiber

network, upgrade our mobile network (including spectrum licenses), and fund our expansion programs.

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, our (accrued) capital expenditures amounted to €61 million,

which related primarily to the continued fiber network rollout and upgrades to our mobile network. Of the total
capital expenditures, €54 million related to network, plant and equipment and €7 million related to IT intangible
assets.

For the financial year ended December 31, 2023, our (accrued) capital expenditures amounted to €349

million, which related primarily to expenditures on our network, 5G license fees as well as IT software. Of the
total capital expenditures, €260 million related to network, plant and equipment, €55 million related to spectrum
license fees paid to the government to permit telecommunications activities and €34 million related to IT software.

For the financial year ended December 31, 2022, our (accrued) capital expenditures amounted to €286

million, which related primarily to expenditures on our network as well as IT. Of the total capital expenditures,
€247 million related to network, plant and equipment and €39 million related to IT intangible assets.

As we complete our FTTH roll-out, we expect future associated network maintenance cost and capital

expenditure requirements to be meaningfully lower compared to traditional legacy copper networks.

**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**

As of December 31, 2023, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.

**Contingent Liabilities**

We are subject to a number of lawsuits, claims and disputes with third parties, including with regulatory

and taxation authorities, which give rise to contingent obligations. For a description of certain of these matters,
see “Business—Litigation.”

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk**

We are exposed to various market risks, including interest rate fluctuations, credit and liquidity risks

associated with our underlying assets, liabilities, forecast transactions and firm commitments. Our treasury
department is responsible for managing exposure to market risk that arises in connection with operations and
financial activities, including interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate, credit and liquidity and management
of the credit risk of counterparty institutions selected to hold assets.

The following sections discuss our significant exposures to market risk. The following discussions do

not address other risks that we face in the normal course of business, including legal risks. See “Risk Factors.”

**_Interest rate risk management_**

We are exposed to market risks as a result of changes in interest rates. Financial liabilities issued at

floating rates, such as those under our Senior Facilities, expose us to cash-flow interest rate risk, while fixed rate
financial liabilities expose us to fair value interest rate risk.

We manage our net exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate financial debt and

variable rate financial debt in our total financial debt portfolio. For example, to manage this mix, we currently
have €1,054 million of fixed rate Existing Notes outstanding, for which there is no exposure to interest rate risk.

In addition, in 2022, we entered into four interest rate swaps with a total notional principal amount of

€536 million with maturity date on May 31, 2026. These swaps have the effect of fixing the floating rate part of
the interest rate payable under €536 million of the €765 million Facility B borrowings to 1.463% for €383 million
and 2.563% for €153 million for the duration of the swaps.

**_Foreign exchange rate risk management_**

We operate mainly in the currency of the primary jurisdiction in which we operate, the euro. Our

exposure to currency risk has therefore been limited.


-----

As much as possible, we use foreign currency inflows for our foreign currency outflows. If necessary,

we buy foreign currency shortly before the transaction. If any material exposure arises, we may enter into foreign
exchange rate hedging instruments in the ordinary course of business and not for speculative purposes.

**Critical Accounting Estimates**

The preparation of our financial statements requires our management to make assumptions that affect the

reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our balance sheet and the reported amounts of revenue and
expenses during the fiscal period. Estimates and judgments used in the determination of reported results are
continuously evaluated.

Estimates and judgements are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are

believed to be reasonable in the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions. Our significant accounting policies and a description of our use of estimates and
judgments are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements as of and for the financial year ended
December 31, 2023 included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum (see Note 5 to the 2023 Audited Financial
Statements for a summary).

**Macroeconomic overview**

Ireland, which is the market that we operate in, has a healthy economy which in the recent past

significantly outperformed the EU27 average, growing at 7.1% on average over 2021-2024 in real GDP terms,
compared to the EU27 average of 3.3% and the UK’s 4.4% for the same period. In 2023, the Irish economy
recorded a real GDP decline of 3.2%, compared to 0.4% growth for the EU27 and 0.1% growth for the UK in the
same year. According to the European Economic Forecast – Spring 2024, Ireland’s recent economic contraction
was primarily driven by the weak performance of specific multinational-dominated sectors. Specifically, modified
domestic demand, which better reflects the underlying domestic economic activity, grew marginally by 0.5%,
impacted by elevated inflation and tight financial conditions. Preliminary real GDP estimates show that the Irish
economy has started to rebound, and real GDP is expected to grow by 1.2% in 2024 and by 3.6% in 2025 (Source:
Spring European Economic Forecast 2024). Irish unemployment continues to show significant improvement,
having declined from the high levels of 15.5% in 2012 during the economic downturn post the global financial
crisis, down to 5.8% 6 years after in 2018, to reach 4.3% in 2023 (Source: Eurostat). This is in line with the 2023
unemployment rate of 4.0% for the UK and compares favorably to the EU27 average unemployment rate of 6.1%
in 2023 (Source: Eurostat, Office for National Statistics). Furthermore, 10-year Irish sovereign bond yields trade
at approximately 2.6% versus approximately 0% seven years ago (Source: Euronext Dublin website), reflecting
the rebound in the Irish economy. Ireland also benefits from having a young population relative to other European
countries with a median age of 39 years, compared to 45 years for EU27 and 41 years for the UK (as of 2022)
(Source: Eurostat, Office for National Statistics).

The Irish private consumption has continued to grow steadily over the last five years as shown in the

table below, except for 2020 when the global economy was negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic:

**Overview of Irish telecommunications market**

Since its full opening to competition in December 1998, the telecommunications market in Ireland has

evolved significantly in terms of products offered, network technologies used and market structures. Prior to
liberalization, Bord Telecom Éireann, our predecessor and the incumbent operator, held a virtual monopoly in the
fixed market; a small number of operators competed with our retail voice services or data services using leased
lines, or offered deregulated value-added data services. Following liberalization, there has been growth in the
number of customers using services at least partially provided on competitors’ alternative fixed and mobile
networks. There has also been an ongoing shift in the mix of telecommunications services used by customers:
fixed voice services are in decline, while data usage and bandwidth consumption have been increasing rapidly and
this trend is driving the adoption of fiber-based fixed line services. Furthermore, telecommunications services are
increasingly sold in bundles with convergence in the residential market between voice and data communications
as well as TV services. As such, our main competitors today include Vodafone, Virgin Media, Sky Ireland and
Three Group (“Three”) (Source: ComReg 24/44).

Overall, the Irish telecom market has benefited from extensive investment in recent years, as well as

from cooperation between operators to share infrastructure assets. This has particularly been manifested in the
fiber broadband sector, which itself has been stimulated by projects associated with the government’s National
Broadband Plan. eir has engaged in several joint ventures, including one with InfraVia by which it expects to pass
1.9 million premises with fiber able to provide data at up to 10Gb/s by the end of 2026.

The Irish market also benefits from a stable regulatory environment where no material changes are

expected. In the beginning of 2024, ComReg set its planned framework for the regulation of the wholesale
broadband market, allowing eir certain flexibility to set wholesale FTTP broadband prices and offer discounted
prices under the condition that it obtains pre-approval from ComReg. Overall, there is scope for further
deregulation in the market which could potentially benefit the operators.

Moreover, ComReg reported that the Irish telecommunications market, which includes fixed line, mobile

and broadcasting (including cable) sectors, accounted for an estimated €0.9 billion in retail revenues for the quarter
ended March 31, 2024, and €3.7 billion in retail revenues for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2023
(Source: ComReg 24/44). Of this, 47.1% was attributable to mobile, 38.2% to fixed line and 14.7% to the
broadcasting (including cable) sector (Source: ComReg 24/44).

The markets for television and telecommunications have been increasingly converging as customers look

to purchase these services from a single provider. As a result, the Irish market has developed into a market for
multi-play offerings, whereby fixed line voice, mobile, broadband and/or television services are bundled into
integrated offerings. The market’s multi-play structure continues to mature and as such, it has recently shown a
marginal slowdown in convergence. In the quarter ended March 31, 2024, 51% of fixed market retail subscriptions
were single play compared to 50.9% in the quarter ended March 31, 2023; 28.8% of subscriptions were double
play (a bundle of two services) compared to 27.1% in March 31, 2023; 20.2% were triple and higher play (a
bundle of three or more services) compared to 22.1% in March 2023 (Source: ComReg 24/44).

**Fixed Line telecommunications market**

Providers of fixed line telecommunications services typically derive revenue from the sale to consumers

of access to their network, tariffs charged for the carriage of voice and other communications on their network
and from data-related services, including Internet and broadband access, and information technology services.
They also charge other telecommunications providers regulated rates for access to their network; for example, for
the use of interconnect services that permit communication between and across different networks, including
between fixed and mobile networks. Our main competitors in the provision of fixed line services include
Vodafone, Virgin Media and Sky.

Fixed line telecommunications market is predominantly driven by fixed broadband with fixed voice retail

now accounting for just 24.7% of the total retail revenue as of March 31, 2024, as customers have continued to
transition from fixed voice to mobile voice services. According to ComReg, the Irish fixed line market (including
wholesale) increased in size by 5.5% in the quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared to the quarter ended March
31, 2023. We remain the largest provider in the fixed line telecommunications market, with a reported market
share of 37.9% (including wholesale) as of March 31, 2024, based on fixed line revenues (Source: ComReg
24/44). We are also leader in the fixed broadband segment, with a reported market share of 27.9% as of March
31, 2024, based on fixed broadband subscriber lines (Source: ComReg 24/44). Looking at the combined retail &
wholesale fixed broadband market in Ireland, we are the leader capturing approximately 59.7% of the total market
for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, followed by Virgin Media with 23.8%, SIRO with 11.5% and NBI with
4.8% (Source: ComReg 24/44 and company analysis).

**_Broadband fixed access and Internet_**

Ireland’s household broadband penetration rate, at 79.1%, was lower than the EU27 average of 84%

(Source: ComReg and Ampere Analysis). Household broadband penetration in Ireland has increased by 8
percentage points since 2013 while penetration in the EU-27 has increased by 17 percentage points. With ComReg
reporting overall fixed residential broadband subscriptions (i.e., excluding business subscriptions and mobile
broadband subscriptions) of 1,666 thousands at the end of December 31, 2023, the fixed broadband household
penetration rate (assuming there were 2,108 thousands households in Ireland) was 79.1% as of December 31, 2023
(Source: ComReg 24/19).

FTTP (includes FTTH) broadband accounted for the single largest share of fixed broadband subscriptions

with 40.4% at the end of December 31, 2023. FTTP[1] broadband subscribers increased by 33.3% compared to the
quarter ended December 31, 2022 (Source: ComReg 24/19). VDSL subscribers made up 27.3% of fixed
broadband subscriptions, representing a decrease of 16.0% compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2022
(Source: ComReg 24/19).

100% of all VDSL connections and 94% of all DSL connections in Ireland leverage eir’s fixed network

as of March 31, 2024. Cable broadband accounted for 20.5% of all fixed broadband subscriptions as of March 31,
2024, down 2.1% from 22.6% in the quarter ended March 31, 2023 (Source: ComReg 24/44). Other forms of
access (FWA, DSL, satellite) accounted for 10.8% of broadband connections as of March 31, 2024 (Source:
ComReg 24/44). According to ComReg 24/44, there were approximately 1.7 million VDSL, DSL, FTTP,
Satellite, FWA and cable broadband connections in Ireland as of March 2024, which is expected to grow
approximately to 1.8 million in 2026 (Source: Ampere Analysis, excluding FWA and Satellite).

__________________________

Generally, the evolution of the fixed broadband market has reflected consumer preferences for higher

speeds. Accordingly, we have made a significant investment in our fiber-based NGA network, with a target of
passing 1.9 million premises by December of 2026 using technologies such as FTTH and, as of the quarter ending
March 31, 2024, we achieved FTTH roll-out to approximately 1.2 million premises. This explains the significant
decline in the number of broadband lines utilizing DSL technology, and the simultaneous rise in the number of
FTTP lines. Availability of these new, fiber-based fixed broadband solutions underpins the significant growth in
FTTP subscriptions seen in the market, with the number of FTTP connections increasing from approximately
501,000 in December 2022 to approximately 713,000 in March 2024 (Source: ComReg 24/44). Furthermore, as
high-speed fixed broadband networks become more widely available throughout Ireland, consumers who in the
past may have only had access to a mobile broadband solution may now avail themselves of a fixed connection.

Competitors have also made investments to cater to consumer preference for higher speed technologies,

such as Vodafone’s fiber build out initiative with the Electricity Supply Board through their joint venture
company, SIRO. According ComReg, SIRO has passed approximately 566,968 fiber homes as of March 31, 2024
(Source: ComReg 24/44) and according to its website, it aspires to continue its rollout to 770,000 premises across
154 towns, and has formed partnerships with 10 operators including Vodafone, Virgin Media, Digiweb, Sky, BT,
and others. In August 2022, Virgin Media announced that it has entered into a network deal agreement with SIRO
that will help to increase coverage thanks to more than 450,000 SIRO-enabled premises across Ireland. In addition,
Virgin Media, has upgraded approximately 281,302 homes to fiber as of March 31, 2024 (Source: ComReg 24/44),
out of its cable network of approximately 1 million homes (Source: Liberty Global 2023 10-K).

The National Broadband Plan (NBP) is a government sponsored initiative to bring a minimum of 30

megabit broadband speeds to all premises in Ireland that are not presently served by a commercial operator. Open
eir, through its joint venture with InfraVia, Fibre Network Ireland Limited (FNI), have committed to delivering
fiber broadband to 1.9 million homes and businesses across Ireland. Approximately 84% of the country will be
able to access Open eir’s network, with the remaining 16% of homes and businesses falling under the NBP. A key
cost aspect in this effort relates to Ireland’s density of rural population, which is one of the lowest in Europe,
meaning that the cost to roll out rural fiber broadband is high. Consequently, it is challenging to provide high
speed broadband to every home in the Ireland without financial support from the Government. Open eir chose not
to submit a tender to Government for the remaining 16% and instead focused its efforts on deploying FTTH to
1.9 million homes and businesses, noting that 1.2 million homes and businesses can order a full fiber connection
from any one of Open eir’s retail service providers already.

The Government awarded the tender to National Broadband Ireland (NBI), a company that designs,

builds, and operates fiber networks for rural areas in Ireland, therefore it will be NBI that will undertake the effort
of serving the remaining 450k+ homes and businesses. According to ComReg, NBI had passed approximately
232,559 fiber homes as of March 31, 2024 (Source: ComReg 24/44).

Additionally, in 2022, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications published

its “Benefits Report” where it highlighted the positive impact reliable broadband services have on equitable
economic and social development in Ireland. The report also showed that Ireland is a strong performer within the
EU with 58% of Irish households able to access a broadband speed of 1 Gigabit or more; compared to the EU27
average of 51%.

**_Fixed voice_**

ComReg 24/44 reported that fixed voice traffic in the quarter ending March 31, 2024, reached

approximately 273 million minutes, which represents a decrease of 24.9% from the quarter ending March 31,
2023. The largest proportion of calls in the fixed line market is domestic calls (which includes local and national
calls), representing 46.9% of all fixed call line minutes (Source: ComReg 24/44). Managed voice over internet
protocol (“VoIP”) minutes account for approximately 64.1% of total fixed voice minutes in the quarter ending
March 31, 2024, up from 36.1% in the quarter ending March 31, 2023. This reflects a continued increase in
managed VoIP subscriptions (Source: ComReg 24/44).

The general reduction in demand for fixed voice lines is due to a number of factors, including ongoing

substitution by mobile and by “over-the-top” products (Whatsapp, Skype, etc.). Mobile voice traffic alone
decreased by 9.7% for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2023 (Source:
ComReg 24/44).

**Mobile telecommunications market**

Mobile telecommunications services have been available in Ireland since 1985 and there are currently

three MNOs in Ireland: eir, Three, and Vodafone. There are also a number of MVNOs currently active in the
market, including Tesco Mobile and Virgin Media.

In terms of market shares, Vodafone and 3 Ireland have the first and second largest market shares

respectively, followed by eir. There is room in the market for a small number of MVNOs, the largest two of which
are Tesco Mobile and Virgin Mobile. The mobile sector benefited from the multi-spectrum auction in 2022 as this
significantly increased the available spectrum resources, supporting the MNOs to increase network capacity as
they migrate from LTE to 5G.

ComReg 24/44 reported overall mobile subscriptions of approximately 9.85 million at the end of March

31, 2024, representing an increase of 8.7% since March 31, 2023. The penetration of mobile subscriptions,
calculated based on the number of active SIM cards per 100 of the population, including mobile broadband and
excluding M2M at the end of March 31, 2024, was 115.4%, and 68.9% M2M only (Source: ComReg 24/44).

According to data published by ComReg 24/44, the Irish retail mobile market by revenues as of March

31, 2024, increased in size by 5.3% compared to March 31, 2023, mainly due to increases in voice and messaging
revenues.

According to ComReg 24/44, in the quarter ended March 31, 2024, Irish mobile operators’ ARPU was

estimated at €19.68 per month, an increase of 1.0% from €19.48 per month in the quarter ended March 31, 2023.
Mobile users pay for their mobile service by either purchasing prepaid credit, or by entering into a contract with
their mobile operator (postpaid payment option). At the end of March 31, 2024, 75.3% of mobile subscriptions
were postpaid (Source: ComReg 24/44) and, according to Ampere Analysis, this is expected to grow to 83.6% in
2026. According to Ampere Analysis, the estimated postpaid share of the total mobile subscriptions for 2024 in
Ireland is estimated to be 79% compared to the estimated 68% for the EU27 in 2024.

According to ComReg 24/44, eir’s mobile subscribers market share (including mobile broadband and

excluding M2M) for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, was 23.3%, increasing from 22.0% for the quarter ended
March 31, 2023. Looking at the postpaid market specifically, eir was the clear number one provider in Ireland
with 40.2% for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, increasing from 38.1% for the quarter ended March 31, 2023,
followed by Vodafone and Three, that both lost market share during the same time period (Vodafone went from
31.8% to 30% and Three went from 15.6% to 16.1%). Additionally, eir has now reached Three in the second place
in total consumer mobile market, each capturing a 26.5% share for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, with eir
demonstrating good momentum as it grew by 1.5 percentage points from the quarter ended March 31, 2023 when
it captured 25% of the market, while Three lost some market share during the same time period (Three had 27%
of the market for the quarter ended March 31, 2023; Vodafone leads the total mobile consumer market with 30.2%
for the quarter ended March 2023). (Source: ComReg 24/44).

**BUSINESS**

**Overview**

We are the sole telecommunications provider in Ireland that offers quad-play bundles on an integrated

network, and we offer a range of retail and wholesale services. We are the principal provider of fixed line
telecommunications and the third largest mobile telecommunications provider in Ireland.

Our fixed line division provides high-speed broadband, voice and data services to individual consumers,

business users and to wholesale customers. The fixed line division contributed 72% of our revenue (before intersegment eliminations) and 74% of our Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve month period ended March 31, 2024. We
have an extensive fixed line telecommunications network in Ireland in terms of both capacity and geographic
reach. According to quarterly data published by ComReg (Source: ComReg report 22/44), we had a market share
for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 of 37.9% of the Irish retail and wholesale fixed line market, based on
revenue. Our mobile division provides standalone mobile services to consumer and business customers and is also
included as part of our bundled offerings. The mobile business contributed 28% of our total revenue (before intersegment eliminations) and 26% of our Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve month period ended March 31, 2024.
Our revenue for the twelve month period ended March 31, 2024 was €1,299 million and our Adjusted EBITDA
for the twelve month period ended March 31, 2024 was €639 million.

We are focused on convergence and long-term customer lifetime value, and our strategy is to connect

everyone and everything in Ireland, whether by high-speed broadband, voice, mobile data or enterprise
datacomms. This strategy is underpinned by a major program of capital expenditure which has facilitated the
transformation of our business. Our vision for our customers is a converged future with seamless access to
fixed and mobile services.

We are currently well underway investing €500 million to roll-out fiber to the home (“FTTH”) to 1.9

million premises across urban and suburban Ireland, while also investing €250 million updating and expanding
our mobile network with a view to significantly increasing our high-speed mobile data capabilities, rolling out
Ireland’s largest 5G network and expanding 4G coverage to 99% of the outdoor geography of Ireland.

**_Fixed line services_**

We are the largest provider of fixed line telecommunications services in Ireland, offering broadband,

voice, TV, datacomms and managed services to individual consumers and business users under the eir brand. We
also offer other authorized operators (“OAOs”) a range of wholesale services including high-speed broadband,
voice and managed services under our open eir brand. According to quarterly data published by ComReg (Source:
ComReg 24/44), we had a market share for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 of 37.9% of the Irish retail and
wholesale fixed line market, based on revenue. We have an extensive fixed line telecommunications network in
Ireland in terms of both capacity and geographic reach. We are also the leading provider of broadband services in
Ireland with 463,000 retail and 485,000 wholesale customers as of March 31, 2024, and an overall market share
of 27.9% of retail fixed broadband as of March 31, 2024. As of March 31, 2024, we had approximately 582,000
access lines in service (including standalone broadband (“SABB”) and wholesale Local Loop Unbundling
(“LLU”)).

Revenue (before inter-segment eliminations) from our fixed line services was €962 million for the twelve

month period ended March 31, 2024. Adjusted EBITDA from our fixed line services was €476 million for the
twelve month period ended March 31, 2024.

**_Mobile services_**

We are the third largest mobile operator in Ireland in terms of revenue and customers. Our Mobile

division is comprised of both consumer and eir business mobile. According to data published by ComReg for the
quarter ended March 31, 2024, we had an overall mobile market share of 14.7% based on the number of
subscribers, including mobile broadband, a market principally comprised of three large players: Vodafone Ireland
Ltd (“Vodafone”), Three Ireland (Hutchinson) Limited (“Three”) and eir. Our strategy is to maximize customer
lifetime value within the mobile business whether through standalone propositions or bundling with fixed line
services.

As of March 31, 2024, approximately 78% of our customer base was in postpay contracts and the

remainder in prepay contracts. Revenue for our mobile division was €374 million for the twelve month period
ended March 31, 2024. Adjusted EBITDA of the mobile division was €163 million for the twelve month period
ended March 31, 2024. Adjusted EBITDA margin of the mobile division was 44% for the twelve month period
ended March 31, 2024.

**Our Strengths**

**_A strong Irish macroeconomic environment supports an attractive telecommunications market with balanced_**
**_market shares_**

We operate in Ireland, a country with strong macroeconomic growth drivers and an attractive

telecommunications market. We believe eir is well-positioned to benefit from the positive trends in this market.

With a growing population of approximately 5.3 million as of 2023, a 2.0% increase since 2020, Ireland

is a developed market economy with nominal GDP per capita in 2023 of €95,280 compared to the EU27 average
of €37,620 and to £39,315 for the UK (Source: Eurostat, Office for National Statistics). Ireland has a healthy
economy which in the recent past significantly outperformed the EU27 average, growing at a 7.1% on average
over 2021-2023 in real GDP terms, compared to the EU27 average of 3.3% and UK’s average of 4.4% for the
same period. In 2023, the Irish economy recorded a real GDP decline of 3.2%, compared to 0.4% growth for the
EU27 and 0.1% growth for the UK in the same year. According to the European Economic Forecast – Spring
2024, Ireland’s recent economic contraction was primarily driven by the weak performance of specific
multinational-dominated sectors. Specifically, modified domestic demand, which better reflects the underlying
domestic economic activity, grew marginally by 0.5%, impacted by elevated inflation and tight financial
conditions. Preliminary real GDP estimates show that the Irish economy has started to rebound, and real GDP is
expected to grow by 1.2% in 2024 and by 3.6% in 2025 (Source: Spring European Economic Forecast 2024). Irish
unemployment continues to show significant improvement, having declined from the high levels of 15.5% in 2012
during the economic downturn following the global financial crisis, down to 5.8% in 2018 and down to 4.3% in
2023 (Source: Eurostat). This is in line with the 2023 unemployment rate of 4.0% in the UK and compares
favorably to the EU27 average unemployment rate of 6.1% in 2023 (Source: Eurostat, Office for National
Statistics). Furthermore, 10-year Irish sovereign bond yields trade at approximately 2.6% versus approximately
0% seven years ago (Source: Euronext Dublin website), reflecting the rebound in the Irish economy. Ireland also
benefits from having a young population relative to other European countries with a median age of 39 years,
compared to 45 years for EU27 and 41 years for the UK (as of 2022) (Source: Eurostat, Office for National
Statistics).

The Irish telecommunications market, which includes fixed line, mobile and broadcasting (including

cable) sectors, accounted for an estimated €0.9 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, and €3.7 billion in
retail revenues for the twelve-month period December 31, 2023 (Source: ComReg 24/44). The fixed broadband
market is comprised of four main competitors: eir, Vodafone, Virgin Media, and Sky Ireland, with an additional
group of other smaller operators. Of the main operators, we have the leading market share based on fixed
broadband subscriptions at 27.9% as of March 31, 2024 (Source: ComReg 24/44). Based on the combined retail
and wholesale fixed broadband market in Ireland, we are the leaders capturing approximately 59.7% of the total
market for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, followed by Virgin Media with 23.8%, SIRO with 11.5% and NBI
with 4.8% (Source: ComReg 24/44 and company analysis). Furthermore, we have an extensive fiber infrastructure
covering approximately 65% of Irish premises. Ireland’s household broadband penetration rate, at 79.2% as of
December 31, 2023 (78.3% as of March 31, 2024), was lower than the EU27 average of 83.9% for 2023 (Source:
ComReg and Ampere Analysis), and we therefore continue to see an opportunity for growth in this area. The
mobile market is comprised of three mobile network operators (“MNOs”): eir, Three and Vodafone. There are
also a number of Mobile Virtual Network Operators (“MVNOs”) currently active in the market, which together
account for approximately 13% of total market (including mobile broadband and excluding Machine to Machine
(“M2M”)). Our mobile market share was 23.3% for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared to 22.0% for
the quarter ended March 31, 2023 (Source: ComReg 24/44). Data usage and bandwidth consumption have been
increasing rapidly in recent years, driven by the adoption of fiber-based fixed line services and 4G and 5G network
infrastructure to deliver high quality fast access to data anytime, anywhere. As a single-country focused operator,
we are the only operator in Ireland that wholly owns the material infrastructure underlying each of our four
services (fixed voice, high speed fixed broadband, mobile and Internet Protocol television (“IPTV”)).

The Irish telecommunications market also offers a stable regulatory environment in which to operate,

with regulation within Ireland being consistent with the EU. Under the current framework for the regulation of
wholesale broadband markets, recently announced in January 2024, we are allowed certain pricing flexibility to
set wholesale FTTP broadband prices, and can offer discounted prices for wholesale FTTP broadband services
with pre-approval from ComReg. We maintain a regular dialogue with ComReg, and we believe there is increased
scope for deregulation, given the commitment by ComReg to annually review the market. We are hopeful that the
regulatory environment evolves to offer higher visibility for continued development of an infrastructure-based
telecommunications business, and greater focus on promoting investments in infrastructure and leading
technologies.

**_We are the leading fully converged quad-play telecom operator focused in Ireland with continued increase in_**
**_market share in mobile and broadband B2C_**

We are the sole telecommunications provider in Ireland that offers quad-play bundles on an integrated

network, and we offer a range of retail and wholesale services. We are the principal provider of fixed line
telecommunications and third largest mobile telecommunications providers in Ireland.

We are a fully converged telecommunications operator, offering a suite of fixed line and mobile services,

including high-speed broadband, TV, voice, and mobile services, to a diversified group of retail, business and
public sector customers. Our bundling strategy continues to deliver positive results and, as of March 31, 2024,
52% of our fixed base were double, triple or quad-play customers (compared to 46% for the same period in 2023)
(Source: Q1 FY24 Results).

Our fixed line division provides high-speed broadband, voice and data services to individual consumers,

business users and to wholesale customers. The fixed line division contributed 72% of our revenue (before intersegment eliminations) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. We have an extensive fixed line
telecommunications network in Ireland in terms of both capacity and geographic reach. According to quarterly
data published by ComReg (ComReg 22/44), we had a market share for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 of
37.9% of the Irish retail and wholesale fixed line market, based on revenue.

Broadband B2C

We are the leading retail broadband provider in a highly competitive market, with 27.9% market share

based on fixed broadband subscriptions as of March 31, 2024, achieving 0.2% growth from 27.7% market share
as of March 31, 2023 (Source: ComReg 24/44). We are followed by Virgin Media with 22.2% as of March 31,
2024, who lost 1.5% market share in the last year, notwithstanding that the market has been fully liberalized since
1998 and infrastructure competition has developed and intensified in the last five years.

Our broad service offering means that we can take advantage of the growth opportunity in the converging

telecommunications and media markets with support from customer demand for high-speed data services and high
quality content anytime, anywhere, on any device.

In line with the fixed broadband market, the Irish mobile telecommunication market has continued to grow.

According to ComReg, the Irish mobile market reported total mobile subscriptions of approximately 9.85 million
as of March 31, 2024, representing an increase of 8.7% since March 31, 2023. The penetration rate of mobile
subscriptions, calculated based on number of active SIM cards per 100 population, was 115.4% (including MBB
and excluding M2M) and 108.2% (excluding MBB and M2M), as of March 31, 2024. Our leading mobile offering
has delivered the #1 market position for 5G availability (73%) (Source: Network intelligence provider) with high
customer satisfaction (35.8 NPS Score), supporting us to further grow during the last year by gaining 1.3% of
mobile market share (including MBB and excluding M2M), as of March 31, 2024 (Source: ComReg 24/44).

Mobile B2C

Our mobile division provides standalone mobile services to consumer and business customers and is also

included as part of our bundled offerings. The mobile business contributed 28% of our total revenue (before intersegment eliminations) for the financial year ended December 31, 2023. We are a leader in the postpaid market in
Ireland, with a market share of 40.2% for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, increasing from 38.1% for the quarter
ended March 31, 2023, followed by Vodafone and Three, that both lost market share during the same time period
(Vodafone went from 31.8% to 30% and Three went from 15.6% to 16.1%). Additionally, we have now reached
Three in the second place in total consumer mobile market, each capturing a 26.5% share for the quarter ended
March 31, 2024, with eir demonstrating good momentum as it grew by 1.5 percentage points from the quarter
ended March 31, 2023 when it captured 25% of the market, while Three lost some market share during the same
time period (Three had 27% of the market for the quarter ended March 31, 2023; Vodafone leads the total mobile
consumer market with 30.2% for the quarter ended March 2023). (Source: ComReg 24/44).

Targeted fixed and mobile investments

We are focused on convergence and long-term customer lifetime value, and our strategy is to connect

everyone and everything in Ireland, whether by high-speed broadband, voice, mobile data, or enterprise
datacomms. This strategy is underpinned by a major capital investment program which has facilitated the
transformation of our business. Our vision for our customers is a converged future with seamless access to fixed
and mobile services. Through Fibre Networks Ireland (FNI), our fiber JV with InfraVia Capital Partners
(“InfraVia”), we are currently well underway to completing our FTTH roll-out to 1.9 million premises (with nearly
two-thirds complete) across urban and suburban Ireland by late 2026 or early 2027, while also continuing to invest


-----

in the upgrade and expansion of our mobile network with a view to significantly increasing our high-speed mobile
data capabilities, rolling out Ireland’s largest 5G network and expanding 4G coverage to 99% of the outdoor
geography of Ireland.

Our broad service offering means that we can take advantage of the growth opportunity in the converging

telecommunications and media markets with support from customer demand for high-speed data services and
high-quality content anytime, anywhere, on any device. We have been consistently increasing our FMC converged
household base which has increased to 47% as of March 31, 2024 compared to 41% as of March 31, 2023. We
believe there is significant potential for cross-selling and up-selling our fixed line voice, broadband, mobile and
TV services, which will increase RGU’s per household and result in lower churn in our subscriber base over time.
We believe our leading position in bundled services is further supported by the large fixed and mobile investments
we have made in our network infrastructures over time, making us the only provider with full ownership of
network infrastructures in Ireland in both fixed line and mobile services today.

**_We have a market leading business division with a comprehensive offering_**

We put a lot of emphasis in strengthening our B2B offering. The acquisition of Evros, Ireland’s best-in
class IT services provider, in January 2021, was a transformational move to create the number one leading ICT
franchise in Ireland. Through this acquisition, we enhanced our existing portfolio of enterprise communication
services, by adding capabilities in cyber security, communications, cloud and managed services. As a result, our
B2B positioning and ICT offering is now complemented by a comprehensive product suite that enables us to meet
the needs of businesses across multiple industries, with increasing embeddedness facilitating cross-selling and
upselling across the client base, driving 15% revenue growth in 2023. We have also received a number of
independent awards from major hardware and software providers in Ireland which highlight the strength of our
offering.

**_We are a leader in fixed wholesale, with an extensive national network_**

We have an extensive fiber network in Ireland, having installed 13,500 kilometers of fiber in 8,000

kilometers of sub-duct using our existing ducts to support our NGA network, and passed 1.22 million premises as
of March 31, 2024 or approximately 64% of the total passed with NGA, as well as an extensive copper
infrastructure supplementing our network.

Fibre to the Premises (FTTP) network in Ireland

As of March 31, 2024, we had reported approximately 1.21 million FTTP broadband lines, followed by

SIRO with approximately 567,000 lines, Virgin Media Ireland with approximately 281,000 lines and NBI with
approximately 233,000 lines (Source: ComReg 24/44).

In the wholesale market, we provide a broad range of infrastructure and managed services such as

wholesale line rental, bitstream, line share, LLU, capacity-based products and interconnect services. We provide
the capability for other operators to provide retail services to customers, as well as high capacity backhaul services
for MNOs to connect their radio sites.

Our wholesale division operates on a non-discriminatory basis, offering a range of regulated services

(including fiber) on “open access” basis, meaning it is available to other operators in the market on an equivalent
basis to our retail division, which drives the most efficient utilization of the asset and provides us with additional
revenue opportunities.

The majority of operators, including Vodafone, BT, Three, and Sky, are significant customers of our

wholesale business and specifically our core and access networks for the provision of mobile backhaul services
as well as services to their end user consumer and business customers, particularly given our unmatched network
coverage in approximately two thirds of the country. Consequently, we often gain some wholesale business if we
lose retail or business customers to OAOs.

**_We have a well-invested national fixed network, with FTTH roll-out targeted to be completed by 2027, and_**
**_top-tier mobile network_**

We believe our leading converged position is supported by the large fixed and mobile investments we

have made in our network infrastructures over time, helping us maintain the full ownership of network
infrastructures in both fixed line and mobile services. We continue to invest significantly including the roll-out of
our FTTH network, the roll-out of our 5G network and IT transformation, as well as investments in spectrum.
These substantial investments have resulted in an extensive fiber network infrastructure in Ireland, delivering the


-----

next generation of broadband data services and a mobile network that achieves an estimated 73% outdoor
population coverage for 5G and 99% for 4G.

Fixed Network

We have constructed an extensive FTTH fiber network, having completed approximately 1.2 million

FTTH homes passed as of March 31, 2024 with the intention to reach a total of 1.9 million homes passed by 2027.
The total budget to reach 1.9 million FTTH homes passed is approximately €1 billion, of which approximately
€500 million was spent to complete the first 1 million FTTH homes passed. As of March 31, 2024, we had passed
approximately 0.9 million premises with Fiber to the Cabinet (“FTTC”) technology (Source: Q1 2024 company
report), which offers broadband speeds of up to 100 Mb/s with the aid of vectoring technology. We are also
completing the roll-out of high-speed broadband to more than, using predominantly FTTH technology, and, as of
March 31, 2024, we had passed approximately 330,000 premises in rural areas bringing the total of FTTH
premises to approximately 1.2 million. As of March 31, 2024, approximately 880,000, or 42%, of our broadband
customers signed up to our NGA fiber services, compared to approximately 840,000, or 42%, as of March 31,
2023. We are also the controlling and operating shareholder of FNI, a Fiber joint venture with InfraVia that was
completed in June 2022 with the aim to accelerate the roll-out of ultrafast FTTH broadband across Ireland. In this
joint venture we own a 50.01% stake and we are providing our existing fiber and copper network, while InfraVia
joined as a financial partner providing approximately €0.6 billion to fund the rollout of fiber to 1.9 million homes.

We believe the reach and quality of our network allows us to offer highly attractive and competitive

services in terms of speed, capacity, content, connection reliability and cost efficiency. Our state-of-the-art
network has enabled us to launch a range of entertainment services on fiber, including TV services.

Mobile Network

We have a nationwide radio access base station network with approximately 2,600 mast sites. This

network has undergone a full transformation since 2019, upgrading existing sites while developing approximately
700 new sites throughout Ireland. This network is a fully independent radio access network (“RAN”) with no
sharing dependencies with other operators.

In the 2012 multiband spectrum auction, we acquired 2x10MHz in the 800MHz and 900MHz bands and

2×15MHz in the 1800MHz band. The acquired multiband license is valid until 2030. In the 2017 3.6 GH/z
spectrum auction, we acquired 85MHz in the main urban centers and 80 MHz in the rural regions. The 3.6 GHz
band has been extensively utilized to deliver 5G services throughout Ireland, now extending to 600 cities, towns
and villages throughout Ireland. These spectrum rights run for fifteen years, expiring on July 31, 2032.

In the 2022 multiband spectrum auction, we acquired 2 x 10Mhz in the 700Mhz band, 2 x 20Mhz in the

2100Mhz band and 60Mhz in the 2300Mhz TDD band. The spectrum rights in the 2022 multiband auction run to
2042 and were extensively deployed across the eir mobile network to increase network capacity and data speeds
in 2023.

The continued investment in the eir mobile network has resulted in a multi-award winning network

achievement from Ookla and Opensignal, and eir has consistently achieved Best 5G Network Availability since
the original 5G launch in 2019, as rated by a network intelligence provider. Additionally, eir has achieved the
highest outdoor population 5G coverage in Ireland with 73%, ahead of its competitors such as Three and
Vodafone, whose outdoor population 5G coverage stands at 58% and 51%, respectively (Source: Network
intelligence provider).

**_We have a continued strong track record of operational efficiency, with transformational IT program expected_**
**_to be completed in 2025_**

Our IT transformation program focuses on simplifying and improving our billing accuracy, enhancing

automation, and reducing sales time. At the same time, we are making significant improvements to our customer
experience processes and operations as well as data management systems and system availability for our stores
and customer operations. As part of this initiative, we will soon be retiring our legacy IT systems.

Our management and our principal shareholder, NJJ, are focused on our cost structure and, leveraging

their combined experience, we have embarked on a group-wide efficiency and simplification plan to make eir one
of the most efficient telecommunications operators in Europe. As a result of our disciplined cost management
plan, during the last five years, we managed to reduce operating expenses from 36.9% of revenues, to 30.8% of
revenues, resulting in a 15% reduction of the total operating costs, driving continued EBITDA margin growth.


-----

As a result of this process, we have been able to better allocate our resources which has enabled us to

increase our profit margin, with further upside potential for operational efficiencies.

**_We have strong financial momentum with top line growth, and growing best-in-class EBITDA margin, superior_**
**_cash conversion and strong de-leveraging track record_**

Our business is strongly cash generative, with growth in revenue of approximately 5% in the twelve

months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 (8[th] consecutive quarter),
and with an Adjusted EBITDA of €639 million and €636 million for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024
and March 31, 2023 respectively. We have continued to generate significant cash flows in the face of competitive
pressures by having an increased focus on relevant bundles, improving operational efficiencies and reducing costs
through our efficiency program. We generated adjusted net operating cash flows of €384 million and €243 million
for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 and the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 respectively. Our
Adjusted EBITDA margin of 49% compares favorably to the average of select Western European
telecommunications operators of 37% (based on KPN, Swisscom, BT and Proximus (Source: company filings)).

As a result of our significant investments to date, we have a well-invested fixed and mobile network. As

such, our recently commenced investment plans are largely discretionary (approximately €497 million in fixed
and €167 million in mobile infrastructure over the next three years) and can be scaled back if necessary. We are
currently in the peak funding phase of our FTTH roll-out to 1.9 million premises (with nearly two-thirds
complete), which is expected to be largely completed by 2027. As we complete our FTTH roll-out, we expect
future associated network maintenance cost and capital expenditure requirements to be meaningfully lower
compared to traditional legacy copper networks. Together, this further reinforces our objective to deliver an
attractive cash flow profile and a strong operational deleveraging trajectory as previously demonstrated.

**_We have an experienced management team, supported by sophisticated and disciplined shareholders with_**
**_unique telecoms experience_**

Our management team combines extensive experience from operating in both the Irish and international

telecommunications markets as well as in global consumer brands. Our Chief Executive Officer, Oliver Looms,
was appointed CEO in February 2022 and brings a wealth of experience in consumer brands, having spent 22
years at Diageo Ireland where he also held the CEO position. Our Chief Financial Officer, Stephen Tighe, joined

organization, holding a number of key finance positions including Finance Director for consumer as well as our
wholesale businesses. Our new Chief Technology Officer, Fergal McCann, was appointed CTO of eir in April
2024. Mr. McCann was Director of Mobile & Core Networks from 2015 to 2024 at eir and led the Mobile Network
transformation program during this time. Our CFO and CTO, as well as many other key individuals within the
organization, have been promoted from within and have in-depth knowledge of the company having held a variety
of roles prior to taking on more senior positions.

Our management team has demonstrated its skill and delivery capability in the critical areas of cost

reduction, increasing efficiencies, increasing market position, rolling out infrastructures and commercial offerings
such as FTTH and 5G, as well as working effectively with key stakeholders, including ComReg. Our management
team also has sophisticated commercial and financial expertise gained through completing numerous complex
transactions.

drives our strategy and communicates on a weekly basis with our management team to further refine our strategic
objectives. Our costs, expenses and capital expenditures are reviewed on a continuous basis together with NJJ.

**Our Strategy**

Connecting is our core business. We are responding to the growing customer demand for continuous fast

and reliable accessibility, whether for high-speed broadband, calls, TV or mobile services, by further investing in
our fixed and mobile infrastructure, the foundation on which our services are based. Bundling and convergence
are core to our strategy. Coupled with a best-in-class fixed and mobile infrastructure, we continue to drive our
successful transformation from a telephony company to a converged telecommunications company where our
customers increasingly subscribe to multiple products within our offering.

Our goal is to create value by maintaining our market leadership in the fixed line market and expanding

our presence in the mobile market, while maximizing operational efficiencies and adhering to strict cost discipline.


-----

We are leveraging our extensive fixed and mobile reach and making significant investments in our networks to
provide our retail, business and wholesale customers with a full range of standalone and bundled
telecommunications services.

The key elements of our strategy are:

**_Continue to invest in our next generation fixed and mobile networks with continued roll-out of future-proof_**
**_new technologies_**

Our NGA fiber network currently passes 2.1 million premises, representing approximately 93% of

premises in Ireland as of March 31, 2024, and our copper network infrastructure covers the substantial remainder.
We are making additional investments to our fixed network to further support our superior offering compared to
our competition, by investing in a multi-year program to roll-out our 1 Gb/s FTTH network to approximately 1.2
million premises. The roll-out of our fiber network is being supported and accelerated by the creation in 2022 of
a dedicated fiber company, in partnership with experienced infrastructure firm InfraVia, focused on the
deployment of FTTH across Ireland with access to infrastructure financing.

We expect that such investment will let us:

##### • further capture the opportunities presented by bundling to increase RGUs per customer and maximize
customer lifetime value, by extending the reach and penetration of our triple- and quad-play services
(which include TV services);

##### • maintain high levels of customer service and strong brand recognition to secure customer loyalty;
focusing on retaining and winning back customers through re-contracting activities, bundled services
offerings, and improved marketing campaigns that defend and retain existing customer relationships and
revenue by reducing churn and developing new services to meet the needs of our customers; and

##### • highlight the affordability, capacity, quality and reliability of fixed line services and the benefits they
bring to homes and businesses.

In March 2024, we completed our €250 million investment plan to transform our mobile network,

significantly enhancing mobile voice and high-speed data experiences across Ireland. Our nationwide mobile
infrastructure now provides 5G service in over 600 towns and cities and delivers over 99% 4G outdoor population
coverage. We plan to continue investing in our mobile network in the coming years to further enhance the
experience for our customers:

##### • rolling out Ireland’s largest 5G network to enable ultra-high speed mobile data;

 • expanding our 4G and 5G services to support data traffic growth through development of new capacity
sites in urban areas;

##### • expanding our rural 4G and 5G service through development of new coverage sites throughout Ireland;
and

##### • infill 5G services to continue our 5G market leadership.

Our network investment has supported and will continue to support the exponential growth in data traffic,

and our investments in NGA fiber broadband will continue to provide our wholesale business with a platform for
the provision of backhaul services to a number of mobile operators. We are focused on enhancing capacity and
coverage of our network at reduced costs, with the ambition to generate higher returns while delivering a
differentiated service for our customers and to be the first network of choice for all.

**_Offer high quality, high value bundles, focusing on a more-for-more strategy_**

We will continue to leverage our strong position in the retail market, as the only quad-play operator with

wholly-owned fixed and mobile network infrastructure, to offer high quality and value bundles to our customers,
in order to drive higher ARPU and lower churn. We will do this by:

##### • continuing to improve our bundled offerings, leveraging our leading proprietary infrastructure across
fixed voice and broadband, TV and mobile;

##### • further simplifying our product offering, so that our value proposition is clearer to our customers;


-----

##### • leveraging our content offering as a key differentiating factor, and in particular the eir Sport package;

 • executing our €250 million mobile network investment program, which includes the continued roll-out
of 5G technology to allow ultra-high speed mobile data and to make eir the best mobile network in
Ireland; and

##### • focusing on the postpaid subscriber base to increase the uptake of triple- and quad-play bundles.

**_Deliver a best-in-class customer experience, enhancing our brand identity_**

We intend to drive revenue growth by focusing on our customers and their experience. We plan on doing

this by:

##### • revitalizing our customer experience through in-sourcing of key customer facing functions, including
sales, customer services, retail stores, collections as well as HR, IT and other central functions.

##### • simplifying and improving our bundled offering (we have already reduced the product combinations
available to our customers dramatically during 2018), making it easier for our customers to select our
product offering, whilst our sales staff can more efficiently identify the most suitable packages;

##### • aiming to have the best quality network infrastructure in Ireland, supported by our future-proofing
investment program;

##### • re-designing our IT stack to enable us to better understand our customers, promote relevant key products
and offer high quality customer support; and

##### • rebuilding our systems and processes to be digital first, while leveraging data and new technology to
enhance consumer experience and service offerings, and innovating in a manner that is informed and
driven by our customers’ needs, as demonstrated through our market-leading products GoMo, eir TV
and the introduction of eir evo, the first B2B full service ICT solutions provider in Ireland.

We are continuing to train and upskill our employees and ensure that we have a purpose-built IT stack

that equips and enables them with the appropriate information and tools to offer superior service to our customers.
We believe this continued focus and investment on customer experience is beneficial to customers. Once fully
implemented, it will improve customer satisfaction, strengthen our brand, reduce churn and generate higher ARPU
through more relevant targeted product offerings and ultimately revenue growth.

**_Continue strengthening our leading wholesale position, and capitalize on B2B opportunities through eir_**
**_Business_**

We will continue to leverage the strength of our core and access networks and develop our growing

mobile network to further increase our wholesale and B2B revenues. We plan on doing this by:

##### • retaining and growing our share of Ireland’s growing broadband market through our retail offering, as
well as our wholesale access to OAOs in situations where we are unable to maintain the retail customer
relationship ourselves. In many parts of Ireland, eir is the sole infrastructure provider to access fixed
connectivity. Ireland’s fixed broadband market has grown from 1,576,973 subscribers as of December
31, 2021, to 1,661,534 subscribers as of March 31, 2024 (Sources: ComReg 22/19 and ComReg 24/44),
while our share of the retail market has remained stable at approximately 27.9% (Sources: ComReg
22/19 and ComReg 24/44);

##### • utilizing our leading core fiber network to provide mobile backhaul services to ourselves and to other
MNOs on commercial terms;

##### • bidding on specific complementary projects;

 • continuing to transition our B2B offering away from reliance on legacy access and voice, to data, mobile
and services in order to offset structural declines in legacy products;

##### • targeting all B2B segments with next generation voice, data and video solutions with a simplified product
offering; and

##### • leveraging fixed line business customer relationships to cross-sell mobile services. We believe there is
opportunity to accelerate growth in our mobile B2B subscriber base by combining our existing


-----

relationships with business with an upgraded mobile network. Mobile network coverage is an important
consideration for Irish businesses when choosing a MNO and historically our network coverage has
trailed Vodafone for geographical coverage, a situation which we believe will reverse following our
mobile investment plan.

**_Have an ongoing focus on cost control through IT transformation, simplification and process improvement_**

We will continue focusing on our cost transformation program to meet our ambition of making eir “best
in-class” in the European telecom sector. We want to create a more agile company that can better respond to
customer demands and expectations. We believe this can be achieved through simplification and digitalization of
our business, operations and processes, which in turn will enable faster decision-making and better
communication, without compromising our ambitions to be a leader in customer experience.

We are implementing a simplification program in phases and to date we have already made significant

progress on three key pillars:

##### • Product streamlining: we have meaningfully reduced the number of products offered and will maintain
a lean product offering, resulting in simplification for many parts of our organization and we will
continue offering exciting new propositions to our customers at competitive pricing;

##### • Investing in and rebuilding our IT stack: we have identified and will retire many of our legacy IT systems,
designing and building a new customized IT stack, removing redundant applications and generating
meaningful savings; and

##### • Process simplification: we will continue to review our organization structure and processes on an ongoing
basis to identify further simplification opportunities.

In addition, our focus on our efficient cost structure will generate additional savings, as we continue to

negotiate vendor contracts through a comprehensive review of all existing agreements, and in some instances look
to create multi-vendor support agreements.

**_Maintain financial discipline and deliver sustainable growth, creating an attractive cash flow and deleveraging_**
**_profile_**

The management and our shareholders are focused on making our company “best-in-class” and future
proofing our fixed and mobile infrastructure by continuing our investments over the next few years. We aim to
continually improve cash flow organically and by implementing our efficiency and simplification program and,
among other initiatives, pursuing smart growth opportunities available to us in a manner that generates high
incremental return on both our capital and commercial investments to drive increased EBITDA. Our key priorities
are to develop our growth areas, improve customer service and increase revenues, while focusing on process
simplification, cost efficiency and achieving operationally driven deleveraging in the medium term through
growth in EBITDA.

**History**

In July 1999, the Irish government privatized Bord Telecom Éireann plc (at the time Ireland’s primary,

and state owned, telecommunications company) in line with the EU requirement to liberalize the
telecommunications industry. Further to the Irish government’s decision to privatize, Bord Telecom Éireann plc
was floated on the Irish, London and New York stock exchanges, and then changed its name to eircom plc.

In 2001, we disposed of our mobile phone segment and were taken private by the Valentia consortium.

In 2004, we re-floated on the Irish and London stock exchanges. In 2005, we re-entered the mobile phone market
with the acquisition of Meteor, and were owned successively by the Australian investment group Babcock and
Brown Limited (2006-2010) and Singapore Technologies Telemedia (2010-2012).

In March 2012, we entered examinership, a court protection system that allowed us to restructure our

debt. We exited examinership in June 2012, and under the scheme of arrangement endorsed by a majority of our
creditors, we were controlled by an entity ultimately controlled by our lenders under our then senior facilities
agreement.

During May 2013, we launched high speed broadband services over our NGA network and were the first

to market with “quad-play” in January 2014 enabled by the launch of our IPTV offering, which we subsequently
upgraded through the launch of eir TV in October 2019. Following the Irish spectrum auction in November 2012,
we commenced the roll-out of our 4G (LTE technology) network, and, in September 2013, became the first mobile


-----

operator to commercially launch 4G services in Ireland. In September 2015, we launched our roll-out fiber to the
home (“FTTH”) program, offering superfast broadband with speeds up to 1 Gbp/s.

On April 9, 2018, Toohil Telecom Holdings Limited (“Toohil”), a company that is majority controlled

by NJJ Boru SAS (“Boru”), a subsidiary of NJJ, an investment vehicle of Xavier Niel, and Iliad SA, an investment
vehicle of Xavier Niel, acquired 100% of Wexford Ltd. (“Wexford”). NJJ and Iliad have an indirect investment
interest in Toohil of 32.9% and 31.6%, respectively. Anchorage Capital Group LLC and Davidson Kempner
Capital Management LP, hold an indirect minority investment interest in Toohil of 26.6% and 8.9% respectively.

In 2019, we launched GoMo, a new online SIM-only mobile network, as well as Ireland’s largest 5G

network, with 5G outdoor population coverage across 600 towns and cities from 1,675 sites across all counties as
of March 31, 2024.

On March 1, 2021, we acquired Hibernia Services Limited from the Evros Technology Group, a “best
in-class” IT services provider in Ireland, and launched our eir evo brand, providing integrated connectivity and
ICT solutions to large and medium businesses.

In January 2022, we established a joint venture partnership with InfraVia, a leading independent private

equity firm specializing in infrastructure and technology investments, to help accelerate the pace of expansion of
our FTTH program through a newly established subsidiary, FNI.

We have also recently entered into an arrangement with a large OAO to sell our broadband from

September 2024 onwards.

**Our Brand**

On March 20, 2024, following a €1.2 billion five-year investment in our infrastructure and customer care,

we unveiled “eir for all,” a new modern, inclusive and accessible brand identity, representing our first major brand
refresh since 2015. Bridging our heritage with our pivotal role in contemporary Irish society, “eir for all”
underscores our enduring commitment to enhancing connections across Ireland. Through “eir for all,” we
showcase our efforts in fostering inclusivity and accessibility, reinforcing our vision of a connected and integrated
community.

**Our Converged Service Platform**

Our existing fixed line network provides widespread customer reach in Ireland. We have invested

approximately €2 billion since 2017 in an NGA network and provided fiber-based services to customers through
the deployment of a combination of FTTC and FTTH to over approximately 2.1 million premises or approximately
93% of the total in Ireland.

As of March 31, 2024, we have passed 2.1 million homes and premises with NGA fiber, with a

penetration rate of 42%. We have a total fiber active customer base of 873,000. Our NGA network enables us to
offer to our customers a quad-play bundle of services including fixed line voice and broadband, mobile voice and
IPTV services providing linear and on-demand TV. Our advanced retail billing system, which was launched in
conjunction with our NGA services, delivers integrated fixed and mobile billing capabilities, which are critical to
the delivery of triple- and quad-play bundles.

We have invested in the development of bundles and convergence building on the emergence of fixed

voice, fixed broadband and TV triple-play services, as well as quad-play services incorporating mobile. As of
March 31, 2024, triple or quad-play customers represented approximately 51% of our fixed access households.
This was increase up from 46% for the same period last year.

In addition to the investment being made in our NGA network, we are continuing to invest in our mobile

network. We have invested approximately €250 million updating and expanding our mobile network, with a view
to significantly increasing our high-speed mobile data capabilities, rolling out Ireland’s largest 5G network and
expanding 4G coverage to 99% of the outdoor geography of Ireland, which we believe will make our network one
of the most expansive in the world. We now have 2,750 sites of which 1,675 are 5G enabled. This means we can
offer 5G services across over 600 towns and cities in Ireland.

**Fixed Line and Mobile Services**

As of March 31, 2024, we had 463,000 retail and 485,000 wholesale customers, compared with the

following: March 31, 2023, when we had 447,000 retail and 499,000 wholesale customers, December 31, 2023,
when we had 460,000 retail and 490,000 wholesale customers, September 30, 2023, when we had 455,000 retail


-----

and 492,000 wholesale customers and June 30, 2023, when we had 447,000 retail and 499,000 wholesale
customers.

Our monthly mobile prepay churn for the quarters ending, March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023,

September 30, 2023, June 30, 2023 and March 31, 2023 was 3.4%, 3.7%, 3.8%, 3.2% and 3.2%, respectively,
while our monthly postpay (excluding M2M) churn for the same periods was 0.9%, 1.0%, 0.9%, 0.8% and 0.8%
respectively.

Blended Consumer Fixed ARPU was €47.50 as of March 31, 2024, compared with €46.90 as of March

31, 2023, €48.30 as of December 31, 2023, €48.80 as of September 30, 2023 and €48.90 as of June 30, 2023.
Wholesale WLR ARPU was €16.90 as of March 31, 2024, compared with €16.90 as of March 31, 2023, €16.30
as of December 31, 2023, €16.20 as of September 30, 2023 and €16.40 as of June 30, 2023. Wholesale Bitstream
ARPU was €20.80 as of March 31, 2024, compared with €17.90 as of March 31, 2023, €19.80 as of December
31, 2023, €19.10 as of September 30, 2023 and €18.50 as of June 30, 2023. Mobile blended ARPU was €18.20 as
of March 31, 2024, compared with €18.30 as of March 31, 2023, €18.60 as of December 31, 2023, €18.80 as of
September 30, 2023 and €18.70 as of June 30, 2023.

**_Retail_**

Our retail fixed line business is composed of “consumer” and “business” end customers with whom we

have a direct network and billing relationship. This is distinct from our wholesale business, in which we do not
have a direct relationship with the end customer. As of March 31, 2024, we had 565,000 retail access lines and
463,000 retail broadband customers.

_Consumer_

Our Consumer division is the largest division. We offer fixed and mobile services to approximately 2.4

million customers, comprising 948,000 fixed and 1,451,000 mobile customers as of March 31, 2024. We are the
market leader in fixed line and we had 45.6% of the retail fixed line market as of December 31, 2023, according
to ComReg.

We offer bundles of services and standalone propositions of voice, high speed broadband, TV, and

mobile services to households and individuals. We are focused on maximizing customer lifetime value through
our bundling and convergence strategy and, as of December 31, 2023, we had one of the broadest distribution
networks of all telecommunications operators in Ireland, with 70 stores . We support consumer sales and
marketing programs with direct marketing campaigns through a wide range of media including TV, telephone,
radio, press, outdoor, and the Internet.

_Fixed line_

In line with the trend elsewhere in Europe, the retail voice subscriber base in Ireland has been contracting

due to fixed-to-mobile substitution, albeit the rate of this decline has begun to slow. In response to this trend, we
have focused on retaining our existing customers through re-contracting and promotional offers and attracting
new customers through the sale of “dual-play,” “triple-play” and “quad-play” service offerings comprised of fixed
voice, mobile services, high-speed broadband, TV services to stabilize subscriber numbers and ARPU and grow
RGU’s. As of March 31, 2024, 52% of fixed households were taking three or more services as part of a bundle.
See “—Bundling” below for further details of these offers.

Ireland’s household broadband penetration rate is at 79.2% as of December 31, 2023 (78.3% as of March

31, 2024), and we believe that broadband penetration will grow given the demand for high-speed connectivity and
therefore there exists an opportunity for us to grow our market position. As of March 31, 2024, we had 873,000
eir Fibre customers, representing approximately 92.1% penetration of our consumer broadband base of
approximately 948,000 customers.

_Mobile_

We continue to leverage our significant investment in our Mobile network with an emphasis on

maximizing value. In 2019, we launched GoMo, a new online SIM-only mobile network, as well as Ireland’s
largest 5G network.

_Bundling_

Bundling and convergence is a key part of our strategy to maximize customer lifetime value through

increased RGU’s and reduced churn. We are the only operator that provides the full complement of quad-play
services on its own network and we believe this allows us to offer the best value quad-play packages available in


-----

the market. As of March 31, 2024, we had 52% triple- and quad-play consumer fixed households making use of
either fixed voice, broadband, mobile or TV, which has increased from 46% as of March 31, 2023.

Our bundling strategy continues to deliver growth with higher average revenue per household, lower

churn and greater lifetime value. In addition, the proportion of households with mobile in a bundle increased from
41% as of March 31, 2023, to 47% as of March 31, 2024, which drives further increases in customer retention.
Customers with bundles enjoy discounted rates versus those products sold separately, for example post-pay mobile
subscriptions command a €10 discount within a bundle as compared to a standalone postpay contract. Customers
see the benefit in bundling, which allows them to move all their services under one bill and save money.

In October 2019, we launched our new eir TV with Apple TV 4K service. We are uniquely positioned to

capitalize on growth in IPTV, leveraging our investment in the broadband and mobile networks. Through eir TV,
we offer an innovative service that allows customers to watch up to 100 TV channels, through different digital
devices, which includes features such as 7-day catch-up, pause, rewind and start-over on selected shows, as well
as cloud recording on up to 500 programs. Our eir TV customer base continues to grow, with approximately
106,000 eir Fibre customers taking the eir TV service as of March 31, 2024 compared to 87,000 subscribers as of
March 31, 2023.

_Other_

Our services also consist of providing public payphones and public access Internet terminals at “on

street” and selected internal sites in Ireland.

We provide operator assisted telephone services and a directory enquiry service (“11811”) to customers

on all networks, both fixed and mobile.

_Business (“eir evo”)_

We provide offerings that are configurable according to the specifications of each customer. We

primarily offer connectivity services to small and medium enterprises throughout Ireland. To our enterprise
customers, which include large private sector companies in Ireland and the Irish government, we provide a range
of integrated solutions that combine connectivity with ICT and network infrastructure and services to form
complete enterprise solutions. We also provide ICT services to the public sector in Northern Ireland as well as to
Irish customers with subsidiaries or branches in the United Kingdom.

We strengthened our B2B connectivity and ICT solutions offering with the acquisition of Evros and the

launch of eir evo in March 2021. Shortly after its launch, eir evo was awarded the Microsoft Ireland Country
Partner of the Year Award for 2022 as the best provider in Ireland for its forward-thinking, agility and customer
focus, as well as the Power Apps Partner of the Year 2022, and, in May 2023, eir evo was officially named
Ireland’s first indigenous Microsoft Solutions Partner for Microsoft Cloud, a prestigious accolade that can only
be achieved by attaining all six Microsoft Solutions Partner Designations while meeting stringent criteria across
expertise, customer success, growth of investment and technical readiness.

_Connectivity services_

Connectivity services include voice and data fixed line, wi-fi and mobile services, as well as bundled

offerings for SMEs. We also provide VoIP, data, mobile and wi-fi solutions as well as Internet access
enhancements.

_SIP voice_

SIP voice is part of our Next Generation Voice portfolio and is a converged voice/data service that allows

voice calls to be carried over our data network, removing the need for traditional voice lines. SIP opens
considerable opportunities for Irish businesses, bringing their architecture into the IP world of converged
communications. The proposition targets providing exceptional value by carrying both calls and data over the data
network while at the same time maintaining the call quality customers have come to expect from traditional voice
services. SIP Voice lays the foundation for future services like unified communications and hosted private branch
exchanges.

_Mobile_

We had a business handset subscription base of approximately 60,000 as of December 31, 2023, which

is up 9% compared to the previous year. Having developed end-to-end business processes to support our mobile
offering, we have seen significant momentum, most notably in the Small Business Segment. We are continuing
to invest in our on-boarding, in-life service and roaming experiences to support our penetration of the Enterprise


-----

and Government segments which represent an untapped opportunity for our Business division . We have launched
enhanced propositions that combine mobile, fixed and virtualized services offering customers significant value
beyond basic connectivity. We have a unique opportunity to leverage our infrastructure and extensive customer
relationships to cross-sell these FMC solutions to business customers.

_NGN IP Express_

NGN IP Express, a data network service targeted at medium to large business customers, was launched

in 2015 and leverages our investment in NGA technology. The service provides secure, cost-effective private data
networks for business customers at speeds of up to 100Mbps. customers.

_Hosted Network Services_

Hosted or “Virtualized” Network Services merge broadband connectivity with advanced network

features that add utility and value. Services are delivered from shared, on demand platforms with flexible,
consumption-oriented pricing and offer greater customer control. An example of this service is our hosted
telephony, video calling and cloud infrastructure as a service. We offer a solution to mid- to large-scale
organizations that enables customers to replace premises-based infrastructure with a network-based services
delivered on an opex basis.

_Network integration services_

Network integration services include solutions combining devices/premise infrastructure, network

connectivity and services (e.g., virtual services and network management). Examples of these services include
managed networking solutions, which encompass offerings for designing, deploying and operating connectivity,
network equipment and infrastructure and related services, such as security and Managed Wi-Fi. For example, we
offer an Advantage Managed Wi-Fi solution launched that offers fast, secure, reliable and fully managed onpremises wi-fi services with 24/7 support for a single monthly price. We have also developed a Managed Data
Connectivity offering that combines connectivity, equipment, maintenance and management services.

Network security services have been identified as a growth opportunity for our business. In the past years,

a number of services have been developed in conjunction with partners such as Cisco Umbrella Open DNS public
cloud security service and Next Generation Firewalls and related services.

_Certifications_

The Certification Europe Auditors issued certificates for ISO20000 and ISO270001 to our Business

division. The certifications are valid for a period of three years. Our certifications are unique within the Irish
telecommunications market and set out our business service as a differentiator within the Irish market.

**_Wholesale (“open eir”)_**

Through open eir, we provide communication service providers with open access to eir’s nationwide

fixed network, products and technical expertise. Our wholesale business is a strategic partner of choice for OAOs
providing telecommunication services to households, individuals and business customers.

Our fixed line network infrastructure enables us to offer a range of compelling and high-speed services

to our customers. Through our NGA network and IP network, we can offer high speeds, flexibility and a high
degree of reliability on a national scale. Additionally, our NGA network is driving fiber deeper into our network
and providing significant back-haul capacity to serve our own mobile business and is also serving as a means of
generating incremental revenues by offering this capacity to other MNOs. We also transit and terminate voice and
data traffic on behalf of OAOs.

The price at which we offer wholesale regulated services to our customers is regulated by ComReg, and

as of December 31, 2023, the prices and terms on which we offer the majority of our wholesale products are
regulated under the (i) Reference Interconnect Offer (“RIO”) which details the wholesale offering of our PSTN
and ISDN traffic service, (ii) the Access Reference Offer (“ARO”) which details an offering of unbundled access
service to all access seekers and (iii) the Wholesale Bitstream Access Reference Offer which details the bitstream
offering. Our position in the wholesale market provides us with an opportunity to develop services for OAOs as
well as retain the wholesale component of a significant proportion of business lost to competitors at a retail level.

As of March 31, 2024, we had 582,000 access lines, including SABB (of which 485,000 were wholesale

broadband lines and 1,000 LLU lines). The wholesale customer base as of March 31, 2024 can be analyzed as
follows:


-----

Wholesale line rental ................................. 224,000

Wholesale broadband (bitstream) .............. 485,000

Local loop unbundling (LLU) ................... 1,000

Our proposition for resellers includes managed calls and broadband access services (sometimes called

White Label) that allows our OAO customers to make more extensive use of our network and services instead of
investing in their own infrastructure. Our proposition for mobile operators includes a managed Ethernet service
(sometimes called mobile backhaul) to carry the growing volume of data traffic being generated by customers of
mobile network operators and service providers.

We market and sell to our wholesale customers through our wholesale account management team, which

is our primary sales channel. The account managers are trained to deal with the specific information and
communications technology needs of our wholesale customers and are often assisted by our professional project
management team and appropriate technical experts.

Key services of open eir, as of March 31, 2024, are set out below.

_Interconnect services_

Our wholesale business provides fixed line voice traffic services between us and other operators such as

Vodafone, BT and Three. We provide interconnection services to OAOs in Ireland and to international operators
for incoming international calls. Our interconnection services include both the physical link of our
telecommunications network with that of OAOs and the traffic that passes over the link.

We generate revenue from interconnection services for the termination of incoming international traffic

in Ireland. We also generate revenue from transit services for calls made between two operators, which otherwise
have no physical connection. Our domestic interconnection services include:

##### • call origination and carrier pre-selection, providing OAOs with the ability to carry domestic calls placed
from geographically assigned telephone numbers within our network for termination on the operator’s
network or for onward transmission to other networks;

##### • call termination, which takes calls handed over from OAOs for termination on geographic number ranges
within our network;

##### • transit to OAOs or OAO services, which takes calls which are passed on from an OAO’s network to
geographic and non-geographic number ranges within another OAO’s network; and

##### • ancillary services, such as Freefone and premium rate services, Internet services, and directory enquiry
services.

_Access revenue_

Access and bitstream revenue is generated from the rental of physical lines between a subscriber and an

exchange. Local loop unbundling (LLU) revenue is generated where OAOs install their own equipment in our
exchanges for the provision of access and broadband services.

_Wholesale access channels_

Carrier pre-selection single billing through WLR allows an operator to resell our access service and

provide customers with a single bill for access and call services. We maintain and repair the access line, which
remains connected to our switched network, and bill the operator for the line. The operator bills the end customer
for the operator’s bundled service. This service is only available if the end customer has made a carrier preselection for all call types with the relevant operator.

_Bitstream_

Bitstream is a broadband access product that we offer to OAOs, consisting of a high-speed access link to

the customer’s premises, which we create by installing ADSL equipment and configuring our local access
network. We currently offer a range of IP and NGN (bitstream managed backhaul) based services at a variety of
speeds and levels of contention, and, in line with our regulatory obligations, effectively offer to our wholesale
customers equivalent products to our retail ADSL offerings.


-----

_Next Generation Access_

Our Next Generation Access (NGA) product portfolio consists of FTTC and FTTH products. These

products come with the option of being either a SABB or a POTS Based (Voice plus Broadband) variant. Both of
these have a Bitstream Plus and a Virtual Unbundled Access version. The FTTC variant employs vectoring
technology which allows for speeds of up to 100Mb/s per second. Both FTTC and FTTH come with a multicast
capability which allows for the broadcast of TV.

_Local loop unbundling_

As we are designated by ComReg as having SMP in certain markets, we are required to make our local

networks available to OAOs on a wholesale basis, i.e. share access to unbundled local loops. We are obliged to
provide LLU access services to OAOs and to publish an ARO, describing the access services we offer. Unbundled
local loop access requires the physical co-location of infrastructure owned by OAOs on our premises in order to
permit such operators to access our unbundled local loop services. We are also required to enable an end
customer’s telephone number to migrate to LLU. The prices of these services are regulated through our ARO.

The service also includes several LLU migration products. These products, termed Inter Operator

Migrations, allow customers to move between OAOs and have their underlying wholesale product change from
LLU to SB-WLR or vice versa. Other LLU product offerings include a facility called Intra-Operator Migrations.
This allows an OAO to seamlessly migrate its existing WLR and bitstream customers to LLU.

Line Share allows operators to provide services such as broadband to their customers without the

requirement to take control of the local loop through LLU. The retail customer pays for line rental and calls to the
first operator, and pays for the services delivered over Line Share to the Line Share operator. Line Share prices
are regulated through our ARO.

_Carrier pre-selection_

Carrier pre-selection allows OAOs to compete with us in the provision of call origination services without

having to develop a local access infrastructure, by allowing customers to choose another authorized operator as
the default carrier for some or all calls.

_Wholesale leased lines and partial private circuits_

We provide OAOs with wholesale leased lines, including Partial Private Circuits (“PPCs”), as set out in

the Leased Line Reference Offer, and interconnect paths, which are dedicated leased lines connecting our network
to that of another authorized operator.

Partial private circuits are partial leased lines that connect a customer’s premises to the point of

connection between our network and that of another authorized operator. OAOs that possess a core network can
use partial private circuits, which are priced in accordance with a different tariff schedule, as a substitute for
wholesale leased lines. We also offer NGN Ethernet products. These NGN Ethernet products provide operators
with an access mechanism through Wholesale Symmetrical Ethernet Access and a backhaul mechanism through
to our next generation network. We offer a 1 and 10 Gbit/s uncontended point to point leased line to cater for the
growth in demand for dedicated high bandwidth capacity.

ComReg requires that we enter into service level agreements for the provision of wholesale leased lines,

PPCs and interconnect paths. These agreements contain penalties which we may be subject to for delays in
processing applications for the installation of leased lines and for late delivery of leased lines or interconnect
paths. Our support systems provide full visibility of all steps from ordering services to actual delivery.

_Managed services_

We provide a portfolio of managed services to customers such as resellers and mobile network operators.

Our proposition for resellers includes a managed calls and broadband access service (sometimes called

White Label) that allows customers to make more extensive use of our network and services instead of investing
in their own infrastructure. The main elements of white label agreements are our standard products such as SBWLR and bitstream but also include value add services such as on net calls and managed ISP services. White label
agreements tend to be for a duration of three years and provide a platform to further develop business with these
customers. We have developed White Label versions of NGA services to protect and grow this customer base.


-----

Our proposition for mobile operators includes a managed Ethernet service (sometimes called mobile

backhaul) as well as bespoke network build. Both propositions are used to carry the growing volume of data traffic
being generated by mobile consumers on our network.

**_Group Mobile_**

We are the third largest mobile operator in Ireland in terms of revenue and customers. According to

ComReg, we had a share of approximately 23.3% of the total mobile subscription market (including mobile
broadband and excluding M2M), 23.7% of the mobile subscription market (excluding mobile broadband and
M2M) and 14.7% of the mobile broadband subscription market, as of March 31, 2024. As of March 31, 2024, we
offered services to approximately 1,451,000 mobile subscribers of which 320,000 and 1,131,000 were prepay and
postpay subscribers (including mobile broadband and M2M), respectively.

As of March 31, 2023, we had approximately 1,339,000 mobile subscribers (of which 328,000 were

prepay and 1,011,000 were postpay subscribers), as of December 31, 2023, we had approximately 1,425,000
mobile subscribers (of which 324,000 were prepay and 1,101,000 were postpay subscribers), as of September 30,
2023, we had approximately 1,400,000 mobile subscribers (of which 327,000 were prepay and 1,073,000 were
postpay subscribers) and as of June 30, 2023, we had approximately 1,367,000 mobile subscribers (of which
326,000 were prepay and 1,041,000 were postpay subscribers).

Our customer mix continues to improve and our postpay customer base has experienced growth. Postpay

subscriber numbers (including mobile broadband and M2M), as of March 31, 2024, were 1,131,000, representing
an increase of 120,000 subscribers compared to March 31, 2023. This growth has been assisted by increased
prepay to postpay migrations and the ongoing success of 4G and 5G data offers and increasing take up of mobile
bundles. Our mobile prepay customer numbers (including mobile broadband and M2M) as of March 31, 2024
were 320,000, representing a reduction of 8,000 subscribers compared to March 31, 2023, due to migration to
postpay in line with the overall market trend and increased competition. The prepay and postpay churn rates for
our mobile subscribers were broadly flat for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, with monthly average
churn rates of approximately 3.4% and 0.9%, respectively.

Our mobile service offerings include mobile voice and data services, entertainment and international

roaming. We also offer a range of competitive SIM only plans at all price levels, as well as hardware including
mobile handsets, external USB modems, tablets and wearables. In 2019 we launched GoMo, a new revolutionary
online SIM-only mobile network, as well as Ireland’s largest 5G network.

We offer customers an extensive range of mobile handset makes and models over a wide price range,

subsidized at different levels depending on the price plan chosen by the customer. We also offer customer handset
upgrades based on criteria such as length of tenure and value of the customer. We also offer a range of mobile
broadband modems. These vary based on speed capability and single / multiple user capability.

For a description of our mobile radio network, please see “Networks— Mobile Radio Network” below.

**Central Services**

Our central services unit provides core internal support functions, such as finance, credit and cash

management, human resources, legal services, regulatory support and compliance, logistics and property services.
Non-pay costs comprise mainly power, rent, facilities management, customer services, logistics and
professional & regulatory fees.

**Sales, Marketing and Customer Care**

_Sales and marketing_

We have one of the broadest distribution networks of all telecommunications operators in Ireland, with

70 standalone stores as of December 31, 2023.

We support sales and marketing programs with direct marketing campaigns through a wide range of

media including TV, telephone, radio, press, outdoor, and online.

We have developed a portfolio of data analytics that is unique in the market, which looks at the market

in terms of households. In addition, we have segmented the market into distinct segments to fully understand what
drives customer behavior. This data is used to inform how we sell, communicate and target customers and acts as
a competitive advantage. We have developed a differentiated way to classify our customers based on the product
holdings within the household. To drive our bundling strategy, offers are targeted to drive the addition of more
products to move them incrementally up the value curve to increase ARPU and reduce churn.


-----

We market and sell to business customers through a mix of dedicated field and desk-based account

managers for our larger SME, enterprise and government customers and through outsourced contact center
partners for our smaller SME customers. The dedicated account managers are trained to deal with the advanced
information and communications technology needs of our larger business customers. We have a fully integrated
fixed and mobile sales force within the small business market. This enables us to pursue the customer’s entire
communications spend by leveraging emerging bundled fixed and mobile propositions.

We market and sell to wholesale customers through our wholesale account management team. Account

managers are trained to deal with the specific information and communications technology needs of our wholesale
customers and are often assisted by the professional project management team and appropriate technical experts.

_Customer care and billing_

We have nationwide contact center coverage with sites located in Sligo, Waterford, Cork and Limerick.

We offer our customers a comprehensive level of service, accessible from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday to Saturday
for our mobile customers, and for fixed line customers between 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. weekdays as well as 24/7
broadband technical support via webchat or between 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily by phone.

Our customer support channel strategy is continuously evolving, with increasing numbers of contacts

now handled through webchat. Our contact center service is enhanced through the effective use of self-serve
functionality using comprehensive online, ‘My eir’ app and interactive voice response functionality allowing
customers to perform routine transactions, such as view/pay bill or check account balance 24/7, 365 days a year.

Ongoing investment in systems has enabled us to improve our overall service proposition. For example,

we have implemented a converged billing system which enables us to provide quad-play single billed propositions
to the market.

In November 2023, as part of our strategy to streamline operations, provide more meaningful interactions

between our staff and our customers, and improve our overall customer service and on customer satisfaction by
renovating customer experience, we announced a transformative partnership with NTT Data and Genesys, leading
technology firms in Ireland. Through this partnership, we are replacing legacy call center systems with Genesys
Cloud CX, an application programming interface (API)-first experience orchestration platform based on artificial
intelligence and digital functionality, unlocking vastly improved customer experience. Using Genesys Cloud CX,
we can offer customers multi-channel interactions using digital messaging, social channels and other self-service
opportunities, which also works to reduce the volume of inbound calls, so call center agents can spend more time
helping customers with complex issues.

**_Networks_**

Our Networks business unit manages the national transmission, core, IP, fixed and mobile networks

which underpin the services offered by our Consumer, Business and Wholesale business units. Our Networks unit
also operates our field operations (fixed, core and mobile) as well as service management and monitoring. All
significant network infrastructure investment programs are managed within Networks.

Networks develops our technology strategy related to our networks and engages with the Consumer,

Business and Wholesale business units to design, develop and manage their technology requirements. Networks
also evaluates, selects, pilots and deploys future technologies and provides support for every component of the
networks.

_eir Core IP Network_

We have deployed a nationwide core IP Network (“IP Network”), based on technology from Nokia

(formerly Alcatel-Lucent) and Huawei. The network consists of a backbone layer and an aggregation layer, and


-----

is based on IP/MPLS routers using Gigabit Ethernet (GE), 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10GE) and 100 Gigabit Ethernet
links. Connectivity for the IP network is provided by an underlying optical transport network. This network
provides a simple fully integrated network for voice and data services and will in time enable the retirement of
many of our existing data networks.

The IP Network has a number of resilience features including the use of dual-star architecture with most

aggregation nodes diversely connected to two backbone nodes, high-availability routers with non-stop routing in
the event of a processor failure and in-service software upgrades. The network supports IP Quality of Service and
multicast throughout, allowing us to provide multiple services including voice, IPTV, video and business
connectivity as well as consumer broadband.

We also have international IP nodes in London for handling internet peering and transit, and IP VPN

connections to customers with UK addresses. There are also connections to Internet exchanges in Dublin and
Amsterdam along with a number of private peerings.

A mobile packet core network provides access to IP services for our mobile broadband customers and is

based on a standard architecture. Connectivity between mobile packet core network elements is implemented over
the NGN IP network.

_Optical transport and transmission network_

The core optical transport network (“OTN”) is based on an extensive network which provides fiber optic

cables, with approximately 86,000 fiber route kilometers lit using Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing
(“DWDM”) and Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing (“CWDM”) technologies. The core fiber network
consists of over 800,000 optical fiber kilometers supporting transport for high speed internet services.

_Fixed Access network_

We provide broadband services using both ADSL and VDSL2 access technologies, with Gigabit Passive

Optical Network (“GPON”) for FTTH services. ADSL broadband services are provided at over 1,000 exchange
locations with approximately 1.1 million ports deployed. Approximately 97% of all copper paths are connected
to a DSL-enabled exchange.

_PSTN, Fixed Voice networks and Core Network_

The key retail and wholesale products supported include PSTN access, ISDN PRA, and BRA access, carrier

selection and pre-selection/WLR (Wholesale Line Rental), national and international wholesale interconnection
for origination termination and transit, number portability (geographical and non-geographical), number
translation services and VoIP based business type services like SIP Trunking (PRA replacement) and Hosted
Office (Hosted PBX).

The legacy PSTN / fixed voice network consists of an edge layer with remote switching units (“RSUs”) and

a primary and secondary layer with main switching unit (“MSU's”) nodes, supported by tertiary layers. This
network is three years into a four year program to replace all interconnections with IP based ones, to replace all
RSUs with newer IP based access technology and to replace all MSU's with Media Gateway Controllers
(“MGC’s”). All national and international SIP interconnections are handled by dedicated Session Border
Controllers. In addition, there are also two Intelligent Network (“IN”) core nodes providing key functions relating
to number portability and number translation services.

The Mobile Circuit Switched (CS) Core Network carries all voice and SMS traffic for our 2G and 3G

mobile customers. An IP Multimedia Subsystem platform (IMS) was deployed in 2014, supporting business
trunking service for corporate customers, Voice over Broadband service for fixed retail customers and Voice over
WiFi for mobile customers. The Business Voice services are provided in the Republic of Ireland and Northern
Ireland. In 2019, we extended this platform to deploy and support VoLTE, with ~ 70% Voice traffic now on
VoLTE services across our mobile network. We were the first provider in Ireland to launch Wi-Fi calling, which
enables eir mobile customers to use available private and/or public wi-fi access for voice calls and SMS texts.

The Mobile Packet Core Network supports data over 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G. We have continued to expand

our Mobile Packet Core Network to support the exponential growth in mobile data traffic following on from our
mobile network transformation program and sustained customer growth in recent years.


-----

_Fixed Access network_

Our fixed access network consists primarily of copper connections using multi-pair cables. The cables

are placed overhead on poles or underground in ducts. The copper cables emanate from exchange nodes. In urban
areas, these cables are usually connected to cross connection points (“CCPs”) using exchange-side (E-side) cables.
The CCPs are in turn connected to distribution points using distribution-side (D-side) cables. Some urban cables
and most rural cables are directly connected to distribution points (direct-fed network). Almost all of our
underground cables are located in duct lines (primarily multi-way ducts).

_Mobile Radio Network_

We are licensed to operate a mobile network in the following bands: 700MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz,

1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2300MHz and 3600GHz. All licensed bands are technology agnostic and our 4G network
has now expanded to over 99% geographical outdoor coverage enabling VoLTE services and High speed data
nationwide. Our 5G services were launched in 2019 and, through sustained investment, now extend to over 600
cities, towns and villages in Ireland. Our Radio Access Network, with 2,600 sites, has been transformed to deliver
a high availability, low latency voice and data services with a direct fiber connection to over 50% of network sites.

_Next Generation Access (NGA)_

As of March 31, 2024, our NGA network passed over 2.1 million premises (including approximately 1.0

FTTH premises passed), or 93% of all premises in Ireland. This has been achieved by the deployment of VDSL2
technology in roadside cabinets (“cVDSL”) and in our exchanges and the deployment of FTTH services. To date,
we have installed 13,500 kilometers of fiber in 8,000 kilometers of sub-duct, using our existing ducts, to support
our NGA network. By March 31, 2023, we had extended coverage to 2.0 million premises (including
approximately 1.0 FTTH premises passed), or 89% of all premises in Ireland.

_Network and service management_

We operate a Service Management Centre (“SMC”) for fixed and mobile voice, fixed and mobile

broadband, IPTV and internal services and systems. The SMC proactively monitors our end customer services
and networks, including international points of presence.

The network is monitored at all times at the SMC and is supported by expert groups within our operations

and design areas. When on-site work is required, SMC staff dispatch a member of our national field force, which
consists of skilled technicians located throughout Ireland.

_Networks field force_

The build and maintenance of our networks is the responsibility of the field operations organization. The

main activities this group undertakes include nationwide repair and maintenance of all our Networks, Fixed
Access Network, Mobile Radio Network, Core Network, IP and Transmission Network. This group also has
responsibility for building the Fixed Access Network, Core Network, IP and Transmission Network, provisioning
of PSTN, DSL broadband, IPTV and NGA for our business units, and delivery of the NGA infrastructure roll-out
program. The build and provision elements of FTTH program are subcontracted to Ireland’s largest Managed
Service Provider (MSP), KN Circet. The upgrade and expansion work on the mobile network is also undertaken
by contractors.

**_IT_**

IT develops the technology solutions that enhance our products and services and sustain our growth.

Transformation initiatives being delivered across IT include: Business Support Systems transformation

(aimed at delivering a modernized, simplified Business Support Systems and digital environment while retiring
legacy platforms); Wholesale Billing Transformation to completely separate Wholesale and Retail billing
information onto separate IT stacks; and Legacy IT Decommissioning which is focused on consolidating duplicate
legacy solutions and retiring end of life platforms to de-risk and reduce the cost of our IT estate. The IT delivery
philosophy is to favor building solutions internally, retaining intellectual property and controlling future
operational costs rather than sourcing off the shelf products. Operational stability is a constant priority, with close
management of our third party managed service supplier a major focus for the IT Operations team. Cost reduction
is key objective for IT with a particular focus on reducing the cost of license maintenance and operational support
for our legacy IT estate.


-----

**Insurance Cover**

As an integral part of our risk management program, we purchase insurance to mitigate a number of risks

including property damage, employer, public and motor liabilities, director’s and officer’s liabilities, professional
indemnity liabilities, and cyber-attack liabilities insurance. Insurance cover for these risks is provided to eir within
self-insured deductibles for individual claims which may change on policy renewal from time to time. This
program renews automatically on an annual basis. In addition to the above insurance covers which are renewed
annually, we have also purchased “extended director’s and officer’s liability run-off” insurance covers and public
offerings insurances following previous corporate financing transactions, some of which remain in force. We
believe the levels of risks insured, risks retained and the limits of insurance indemnity are broadly in line with
similar companies in the same industry sector.

**Intellectual Property**

No material portion of our business is dependent on eir specific or unique patents, licenses, industrial,

commercial or financial contracts or new manufacturing processes, other than those generally found in similar
telecommunications businesses.

**Properties**

As of December 31, 2023, we occupied approximately 1215 properties for principally telephone

exchanges, area engineering headquarters, offices, standalone mast/radio sites and cable stations. Of these
properties, 937 are freehold, 65 are held under long-term leases (leases with a term in excess of 50 years), 56 are
held under short-term leases or licenses (leases with a term of less than 50 years), 143 are properties owned by
the Irish State (in which we have rights to remain in occupation), and 14 are owned by the Irish postal service, An
Post, and are occupied by us based on statutory rights granted to us under the Postal and Telecommunications
Services Act, 1983.

As of December 31, 2023, our mobile division also occupied approximately 2,600 mast sites. We occupy

licensed space on other third-party structures owned or operated by tower and infrastructure companies for
example Phoenix Tower International, Cellnex, Towercom, Electricity Supply Board, Office of Public Works and
other various third-party telecommunication infrastructure providers held under license (typically for a term of
less than 20 years).

As of December 31, 2023, we lease 71 retail outlets under various lease agreements, 70 with less than

ten years remaining to the next break and 1 with more than ten years remaining as of December 31, 2023. From
time to time, we buy, sell and exchange our properties as market conditions and operations needs evolve.

**Employees and Industrial Relations**

The total number of persons (Full Time Equivalents) employed by us as of December 31, 2022 and 2023

were as follows:

**As of December 31,**
**Fixed line** **2022** **2023**

Operational/technical ............................................................................... 1,593 1,461

Sales/customer support ............................................................................. 1,163 1,036

Administration ......................................................................................... 346 340

**Total fixed line .......................................................................................** **3,102** **2,837**

Mobile ...................................................................................................... 323 333

**Total fixed line and mobile ...................................................................** **3,425** **3,170**

We are one of the largest employers in Ireland, and the substantial majority of our employees are

employed in Ireland.

We have a well-developed collective bargaining relationship with our trade unions. We employ graded

staff who are employed on collectively negotiated terms and conditions, and non-graded staff, who are employed
on a personal contract/service agreement basis. Graded employees’ terms and conditions are the subject of
collective bargaining agreements, primarily, but not exclusively, negotiated through the Joint Conciliation Council
which is our main collective bargaining forum. The trade unions who participate in this forum are the
Communications Workers Union (the main union in the Group) and Forsa.


-----

**Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)**

We have a long-term commitment to Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) initiatives, best

demonstrated by our independent certification to the The Business Working Responsibly Mark, which is Ireland’s
Environmental, Economic, Social and Governance (EESG) standard. Third-party verified by the National
Standards Authority of Ireland, it is the standard for sustainability that fosters a culture of continuous
improvement, ongoing accountability, and leadership. To achieve The Mark, organizations go through a rigorous
audit-based process that embeds a strategic management system which facilitates internal organizational
collaboration and supports the integration of environmental and social imperatives into core business practices. In
2023, eir was certified with the Mark for the third consecutive time since 2016 and the certification will be valid
until the end of 2026, and is one of only 39 organizations in Ireland to be accredited to the Mark. eir also maintains
the internationally recognized ISO standards 14001 (Environmental Management System) and 45001
(Occupational Health & Safety Management System). Furthermore, eir's long term record and commitment
to ESG is demonstrated by the company’s 39-year partnership with Special Olympics Ireland. This is the longest
sustained charity-corporate relationship in Ireland.

**Legal Proceedings**

Except as disclosed below or as disclosed in “Regulation—The Regulatory Regime,” we are not engaged

in or, so far as we are aware, have pending or threatened, any government, legal or arbitration proceedings which
may have, or have had in the last twelve months, a significant effect on our financial position or results of
operations.

**_ComReg Section 61 application_**

In September 2023, following an unannounced inspection carried out by ComReg in May 2023 in relation

to an investigation into our discounting policies, certain documents were seized by ComReg, some of which were
either subject to legal privilege or irrelevant and potentially outside the scope of the investigation. Following a
period of correspondence between us and ComReg in relation to these materials, ComReg applied to the Irish
High Court, as they were required to do by section 61 of the Communications Act 2002 (as amended by the
Communications Regulation and Digital Hub Development Agency (Amendment) Act 2023), for an order
directing how it should handle the documents it seized from our offices during the unannounced inspection. In
January 2024, the Irish High Court ruled that a “step plan” proposed by ComReg for document review should be
adopted subject to certain amendments. An amended step plan was finally approved by the court on February 22,
2024. The investigation continues and no finding of any non-compliance has been made.

**_ComReg Passive Access Records case_**

In August 2022, ComReg initiated proceedings under Regulation 19 of the Access Regulations 2011,

alleging that we did not fully comply with our obligations to provide access to our passive access records (“PAR”).
ComReg is seeking a fine of €5.4 million. We are defending this case on the grounds that we did provide all
necessary information to our wholesale customers.

**Regulatory Appeals**

**_Access Network Model appeal_**

We have appealed a ComReg Decision of December 20, 2021, to fix lower prices for certain regulated

broadband products using a new cost model, the Access Network Model (“ANM”). Following an application for
a stay of the decision, the court determined that our position could be protected by means of an undertaking from
the notice parties, Vodafone and Sky, to pay us the price difference, if the appeal is successful. In addition to
impacting our broadband revenues, we have argued it will lead to under recovery of costs in the regulated market.
The appeal was heard in July 2022, and a ruling is awaited from the Irish High Court. No date has been given for
this ruling.

**REGULATION**

**Overview**

The basic framework for regulation of the Irish telecommunications market derives from the EU

European Electronic Communications Code (“EECC”). The main policy objectives of the EU Regulatory
Framework are to promote the roll-out of Very High Capacity Networks, protect customers including through
Universal Service Obligations imposed on one or several operators, to facilitate market entry by simplifying
authorization and licensing conditions, and to use a market-focused mechanism for assessing and designating
operators with SMP (a concept akin to the competition law concept of dominant position) and subject to specific
obligations (which may extend in certain specific circumstances to functional separation). The EECC provides
operators with procedural rights including recourse to challenge the decisions of national regulatory authorities
(“NRAs”) and NRAs are subject to procedures in imposing SMP designations and obligations.

This basic framework for regulation of the Irish telecommunications market is laid out in a series of

legislative acts and statutory instruments (“SIs”), which have facilitated the development of competition,
principally through the implementation of various EU directives relating to telecommunications. The principal
relevant legislation includes the Communications Regulation Act 2002, the Communications Regulation
(Amendment) Act 2007, the Communications Regulation (Premium Rate Services and Electronic
Communications Infrastructure) Act 2010, the Communications Regulation and Digital Hub Development
Agency (Amendment) Act 2023 and the European Union (Electronic Communications Code) Regulations 2022
(SI No. 444 of 2022). Parties affected by ComReg’s decisions and regulations may exercise a right of appeal in
the Irish High Court.

The aim of the EU Regulatory Framework is, over time, to allow the transition of the governance of

electronic communications networks from sector specific ex ante regulation to general competition law. In the
long term, the amount of regulation should lessen as competition within the sector continues to grow. In the short
to medium term, however, ex ante sector specific regulation is expected to remain the predominant form of
regulation.

**The Regulatory Regime**

**_ComReg_**

Present legislation vests all responsibility for regulating the electronic networks and services and

premium rate services sectors in Ireland in ComReg, with certain minor residual functions having been retained
by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications. The Minister may also, in the interest of
proper and effective regulation of the electronic communications market, give policy directions to be followed by
ComReg in the exercise of its functions. ComReg is led by a commission comprised of up to three commissioners
and Chairperson of ComReg is appointed by the Minister. There are currently three commissioners.

Broadcasting content services fall outside the remit of ComReg and are regulated by the Coimisiún na

Meán Online Safety and Media Regulation Act 2022 (OSMR Act 2022).The OSMR Act 2022 was enacted on 10
December 2022. The OSMR Act 2022 amended the Broadcasting Act 2009 to establish Coimisiún na Meán and
dissolve the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.

ComReg regulates electronic communications networks and services principally through a system of

general authorization (ComReg 03/81R6, dated June 1, 2018), licenses for premium rate services (content, data
services and value-added services that are charged to a customer’s telephone bill), licenses for radio frequency
and rights of use for numbers.

We operate our telecommunications business in Ireland under this regime. The most important

authorization under which we operate our business is the General Authorization published by ComReg (ComReg
03/81R6) which sets out the terms and conditions that all providers of electronic communications services and
networks must comply with in Ireland. We also hold various individual radio frequency licenses under the
Wireless Telegraphy Act 1926 including mobile spectrum licenses.

**_Enforcement powers_**

ComReg has the power to request information to enable it to verify compliance with license and general

authorization conditions, including SMP conditions. ComReg also has enforcement powers under the 2023 Act
which has established a new enforcement regime including imposing administrative financial sanctions, and
updates to ComReg’s investigative powers.


-----

The 2023 Act introduced a multi-stage civil enforcement process, including a new system of adjudication

for determining breaches and imposing remedies. Adjudicators in the civil enforcement process may make
compliance orders including the imposition of a financial penalty. The maximum financial penalty an adjudicator
may impose on a company is the greater of €5 million or 10% of the company’s turnover in the state during the
financial year preceding the year in which the regulatory breach last occurred. For a natural person, the maximum
penalty is the greater of €500,000 or 10% of their annual income in the year preceding the year in which the
regulatory breach last occurred. An adjudication will only take effect once confirmed by High Court.

ComReg will continue to have responsibility for enforcement of the provisions relating to electronic

communications services under the Consumer Rights Act 2022. In addition, the Competition (Amendment) Act
2022 (the “Competition Amendment Act”) provides that ComReg has the power to impose the following range
of administrative fines:

  - Civil fines for a breach of competition law up to a maximum of €10 million or 10% of world-wide
turnover in the preceding financial year, whichever is the greater;

  - Civil fines for breach of a procedural requirement up to a maximum of €1 million or 1% of world-wide
turnover in the preceding financial year; and

  - Periodic penalty payments for non-compliance with up to 5% of average daily total world-wide turnover
in the preceding financial year per day during which failure to comply is ongoing.

These powers remain subject to court oversight. The Competition Amendment Act provides that the level

of a fine must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive and will depend on the gravity and duration of the
infringement.

ComReg has the power to carry out investigations, on its own initiative or following a complaint, and to

collect and publish information accordingly. In addition, ComReg has the power to suspend or withdraw an
authorization, license or right of use where, in its opinion, there has been serious or repeated non-compliance with
the conditions attached to such general authorization, license or right of use, or failure to meet a specific obligation
relating to SMP or universal service. ComReg may amend authorizations, licenses and rights of use from time to
time “where objectively justifiable, and in a proportionate manner.” ComReg may also apply to the High Court
to seek the immediate suspension of premium rate services which it considers to be in breach of the relevant
license conditions.

There are currently three outstanding opinions of non-compliance in relation to eir. Case 1384 which

relates to upfront duct access charges (ComReg 21/82), Case 1389 which relates to Passive Access Records
(ComReg 21/19 & ComReg 22/16), and Case 1384 which relates to access to Exchange chambers (ComReg
21/82). The commercial court hearing for Case 1384 is set for December 3, 2024. There are no updates on the
other two cases.

The Data Protection Commission is entrusted with the enforcement of a number of obligations to which

we are subject under the Privacy and Electronic Communication Regulations (SI 337 of 2011). The Data
Protection Commission is also responsible for enforcement of the Data Protection Acts 1988 to 2018, to which
we are also subject.

**_Competition and Consumer Protection regulation_**

ComReg also has powers, concurrent to those of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission

(CCPC), to investigate anti-competitive practices, including anti-competitive agreements and concerted practices
and abuses of a dominant position in the marketplace related to the provision of electronic communications
services and networks. The Irish Competition Act 2002 (as amended) regulates competition generally by
prohibiting anti-competitive arrangements and abuse of a dominant position, and by providing for pre-approval
of certain mergers and acquisitions. The CCPC is responsible for the administration and enforcement of the
Competition Act and consumer protection legislation (both of which we are subject to). A person found guilty of
an offence under the Competition Act may be liable for fines of up to the greater of €10 million or 10% of turnover
and/or imprisonment for up to ten years. As noted above, the Competition Amendment Act introduced a system
for the imposition of administrative fines that operates alongside the existing criminal enforcement regime, as
well as a process of adjudication for cases where administrative fines may potentially be imposed. Sanctions can
also be imposed for breaches of consumer protection legislation. ComReg has the authority to conduct on its own
initiative investigation into anti-competitive behavior or regarding a formal complaint of such behavior. A body
convicted of competition offences may also have to pay the costs of investigation and court proceedings.
Amendments to the Act since July 3, 2012 make it easier for private individuals affected by anti-competitive


-----

practices to prove an action for damages against a cartelist, once public enforcement proceedings have
successfully been taken. The European Union (Actions for Damages for Infringements of Competition Law)
Regulations 2017 (S.I. No. 43/2017) apply to actions for damages for infringements of competition law that occur
on or after 27 December 2016. In addition to the above, we are also subject to EU competition law. Enforcement
of EU competition law is undertaken by the European Commission as well as national authorities including, in
Ireland, ComReg and the CCPC.

**_General Authorizations, Licenses and Rights of Use_**

We are not permitted to delegate, grant or otherwise transfer any right, interest or entitlement in our

general authorization to another person. ComReg has extensive powers to enforce or modify conditions to general
authorizations, licenses or rights of use, and to issue directions under those conditions. It is an offence to fail to
comply with the conditions of a general authorization, license or right of use.

**_Levies_**

_ComReg levy and Spectrum Usage Fees_

All authorized entities, including eir, are required under their respective general authorizations to pay an

annual levy, equal to 0.2% of relevant annual turnover, to ComReg to defray its administrative costs. “Relevant
annual turnover” is defined as turnover excluding VAT for the provision of electronic communications services
or networks and includes turnover from electronic communications networks and services provided to other
authorized operators and their subsidiaries. Until such time as the relevant annual turnover for a financial year is
known, the quarterly instalments paid to ComReg are based on the most recent relevant annual turnover statement
available.

_Premium Rate Services_

Network providers that facilitate the provision of premium rate services, and premium rate service

providers pay a levy of 1.8% of premium rate services revenue (equally divided between the premium rate services
provider and the host network operator). This levy applies to retail revenue for premium rate services, and is “ring
fenced” from the general electronic communications networks and services levy.

**_Numbering_**

The use of national numbering resources is governed by ComReg’s Numbering Conditions of Use

(ComReg 15/136R3) last updated in April 2024. The conditions of use allow for the automatic withdrawal of
rights of use of both code and number range where an undertaking’s premium rate services license, authorization
or other approval to operate is suspended or withdrawn for compliance failures.

**_Access to the emergency services_**

All electronic communications services providers which provide end users with a service for originating

national calls to a number or numbers in the national numbering scheme, including VoIP providers, must ensure
that such end-users, including disabled end-users, are able to call the emergency service free of charge. Providers
of publicly available telephone services must also take all necessary measures to ensure uninterrupted access to
emergency services.

The Communications Regulation (Amendment) Act 2007 allows the Minister for Environment, Climate

and Communications to award a contract for the operation of the Emergency Call Answering Service (“ECAS”),
i.e. the “999” and “112” services. Following a tender process, the contract to provide the ECAS was awarded to
BT for an initial five-year period, and since September 2010, BT handles all calls to the ECAS. A call handling
fee, subject to a ceiling reviewed annually by ComReg, is payable to BT by operators, including eir, on whose
networks a “999/112” call originates.

**_Consumers_**

Under the European Union (Electronic Communications Code) Regulations 2022 (SI No. 444 of 2022),

the provision of publicly available electronic communications services to consumers and certain end-users must
be done in accordance with a contract which must include a number of specific provisions. Any modification to
the contractual conditions must be communicated to the customers concerned at least one month in advance of
implementation together with a notice of their right to withdraw without penalty from such contract if they do not
accept the modification. The European Union (Electronic Communications Code) Regulations set limits as to the
maximum minimum term period for contracts, namely 24 months, and require that subscribers are able to
subscribe to a contract of a maximum duration of 12 months. Without prejudice to minimum contractual period,


-----

providers must ensure that their conditions and procedures for contract termination do not act as a disincentive to
a consumer changing service provider.

The European Union (Electronic Communications Code) Regulations also provide for the right of

subscribers to retain their numbers independently of the service provider that they choose. Geographic number
portability permits a customer with a telephone number that was assigned based on geographic location to retain
that telephone number when changing local service providers, provided the customer’s telephone line remains
physically located within the same geographic area. Non-geographic number portability permits customers with
numbers that are standard throughout the country, including Freefone and premium rate service customers, to
migrate to another service provider without changing their telephone number. Number portability is intended to
remove the significant barrier to competition believed to result from customers having to change their telephone
numbers if they wanted to change service providers.

Under the European Union (Electronic Communications Code) Regulations, the porting of numbers and

subsequent activation is required to be carried out in the shortest possible time and in any event within one working
day after the subscriber has concluded an agreement to port the number with loss of service during the porting
process to be minimized and not to exceed one working day.

The General Authorization contains a number of Consumer Protection Rules including the requirement

that all fixed line operators place certain references on a consumer’s bill. These include the customer telephone
number, customer account number and the circuit reference number for LLU lines. This requirement seeks to
facilitate switching between providers on our network including win-backs for us. In addition, in 2013, specific
requirements were included in the General Authorization concerning Itemized Billing and Billing Mediums,
including obligations to issue bills free of charge and within a reasonable period in advance of each payment due
date; the obligation to provide a customer with fully itemized bill or non-itemized bill and not change the level of
itemization provided without the Customer’s consent; and certain restrictions on the use of medium other than
paper on which bills are issued.

On May 29, 2014, ComReg adopted its Decision D04/14 (ComReg 14/52) imposing on all authorized

operators providing publicly available telephone services obligations to adopt some measures to ensure
equivalence in access and choice for disabled users including accessible complaints procedures, an accessible topup facility for prepay mobile end-users, accessible directory enquiries, accessible billing and an accessible facility
to test the compatibility of terminal equipment or an appropriate returns policy. In addition, providers are required
to ensure that the information concerning products and services, including information provided to the majority
of end-users is accessible to disabled end users. They are also required to establish and maintain a facility to enable
disabled users to register their requirements. We are also subject to a code of practice for Tariff Transparency
(ComReg Decision D11/04) which ComReg introduced with the stated objective of ensuring that service providers
present tariff information that is accurate, comprehensive and accessible. The code of practice applies to standard
tariffs covering access, all types of usage charges and maintenance charges, including details of standard discounts
applied and special and targeted schemes. Moreover it is an offence under section 45 of the Communications
Regulation Act 2002 (as amended in 2007) to charge for supplying an electronic communications service an
amount that exceeds the amount specified in the provider’s published tariffs or in a written statement previously
given to the customer, or for supplying a service that was not requested by the consumer or for a service that was
requested by a consumer but not supplied. ComReg has taken a number of enforcement actions generally under
the provisions of section 45 of the Communications Regulation Act.

We must maintain a Code of Practice for Complaint Handling under which we must seek to resolve

customer complaints within 10 working days. The minimum requirements for the Code of Practice are set out in
ComReg Decision D04/17 (ComReg 17/62).

ComReg has established an interactive website for consumers, www.callcosts.ie. This website covers

mobile, fixed line and broadband services.

**_Measures to reduce the costs of deploying high-speed public communications networks_**

The European Union (Reduction of Cost of Deploying High-Speed Public Communications Networks)

Regulations 2016 (SI No. 391 of 2016) adopted in July 2016 provide for a number of measures designed to reduce
the costs of deploying high-speed broadband networks by facilitating access to existing physical infrastructure. In
particular, public network operators are required to make available information regarding their physical
infrastructure, meet reasonable requests for access to the physical infrastructure of their networks, coordinate civil
works upon request from another operator and facilitate access to property where required by another operator to
install connections to high-speed networks. The Regulations provide for a dispute resolution process before
ComReg. The legal regime is in transition following the adoption in April 2024 of the Regulations of the European


-----

Parliament and of the Council on measures to reduce the cost of deploying gigabit electronic communications
networks (Regulation (EU) 2014/1309, amending Regulation (EU) 2015/2120 and repealing Directive
2014/61/EU (Gigabit Infrastructure Act)), which is intended to lower further the costs of deployment of
communications infrastructure and facilitating terms of access on fair and reasonable terms..

**_USO Regime_**

In order to ensure that all users in Ireland have access to a defined set of basic telephony services

independent of their geographical location and at an affordable price, ComReg may under the Universal Service
Regulations designate Universal Service Providers (“USP”) tasked with the provision of relevant services,
whether or not the provision of those services is economic.

ComReg consultation 23/02 proposed that eir should be designated as USP for voice services at a fixed

location for 5 years beyond June 30, 2023. However, no decision was made by ComReg and eir’s USP designation
expired on June 30, 2023. There is currently no operator designated as the USP.

_Compensation_

eir has not received compensation for fulfilling the USO. The establishment of a sharing mechanism,

including in the form of a fund, is required under the EU Universal Service Directive of 2002 and the Irish
Universal Service Regulations where the net cost of the USO is found to amount to an unfair burden on the USP.
On May 31, 2011, ComReg published Decision D04/11 (ComReg 11/42) on the methodology for costing USO
and the requirements which we must meet in applying for funding. Our USO funding application for the period
2009/2010 submitted in May 2012 in the amount of €6.22 million (ComReg Information Notice 12/57) was
refused by ComReg by way of ComReg Decision D01/14 (ComReg 14/03). ComReg found that the net cost of
the USO for eir’s financial year ending June 30, 2010 was €5.1 million and that it did not represent an unfair
burden for us. We lodged an appeal with the Irish High Court which we subsequently settled out of Court. It was
agreed between the parties that no precedent had been set as regards in particular the determination of what
constitutes an unfair burden. There are currently six applications for USO funding before ComReg in respect of
the periods 2010/2011, 2011/2012 and 2012/13, 2013/2014, 2014/2015 and 2015/2016.

ComReg previously issued consultations in response to five of the applications for funding and has found

that a net cost exists but the level of cost is not an unfair burden to eir. The applications in total amount to
€58 million. On April 18, 2019, ComReg published six decisions in relation to our applications for funding, in
which ComReg did not accept that the cost was an unfair burden on eir. On May 15, 2019, eir issued proceedings
in the High Court appealing these ComReg decisions relating to €43 million in costs. On June 24, 2019, the
proceedings were admitted to the Commercial Court, with directions issued for the filing of pleadings and reports
by the parties. After an initial hearing in November 2020, on July 1, 2021, the Commercial Court Judge issued an
order for referral to the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”) for a preliminary ruling. In November
2022 the CJEU ruled in favor of eir on the question of how ComReg should assess unfair burden. The case was
remanded to the Irish High Court and on July 10, 2023, the court made orders which amongst others required that
ComReg’s decisions be remitted for review to take into account the decision of the CJEU. On December 6, 2023,
ComReg published a consultation on the unfair burden assessment of eir’s 2010/2011 universal service funding
application. ComReg’s preliminary view was that the adjusted €7.9 million funding application did not represent
an unfair burden (ComReg 23/113). No decision has yet been published by ComReg.

In 2011, ComReg consulted on principles that could govern cost sharing if it was found that there was a

net cost for us in providing the USO which amounted to an unfair burden (ComReg 11/77). ComReg proposed
that operators contribute to a USO fund in proportion to their revenue subject to a minimum threshold of
€0.5 million. ComReg has not yet published a final decision.

**_SMP Regime_**

The EU Regulatory Framework provides for the designation by NRAs of operators with SMP in markets

that meet certain criteria for ex ante regulation. An operator will be designated as having SMP in a particular
market if it has a dominant position in that market, as determined in a manner consistent with competition law
practice. Once an operator has been designated as having SMP in a market, the NRA is obliged to impose at least
one of the obligations listed in the EECC and must impose all such obligations on that operator as are considered
appropriate, which may include the regulatory remedies of access, transparency, non-discrimination, accounting
separation and cost accounting, and price control/cost orientation. Furthermore, where an NRA finds that these
obligations have failed to achieve effective competition and that there are important and persisting competition
problems or market failures identified in relation to the wholesale provision of certain access product markets, it
may impose an obligation of functional separation, subject to the European Commission’s approval.


-----

Markets that are susceptible to ex ante regulation are listed in a Recommendation of the European

Commission revised from time to time. In December 2020, following a review, the European Commission revised
the list to two markets, the market for Wholesale Local Access at a fixed location and the market for Wholesale
Dedicated Capacity. The European Commission noted that NRAs may also consider whether a separate market
for Physical Infrastructure Access exists NRAs are obliged to conduct a market analysis of the markets listed by
the European Commission and designate operators with SMP as appropriate and impose obligations, following
prior notification to the European Commission. The European Commission may object to the definition of a
relevant market and the designation of the SMP operator but it cannot veto the remedies chosen by the NRA.
NRAs may regulate other markets but the European Commission may veto such a decision.

The European Regulatory Framework requires the review of regulated markets every five years and that

a market analysis is carried out to determine whether or not there is in fact effective competition in that market.
New remedies may not be imposed without such a review, nor may existing remedies be removed without a market
analysis, even where a regulated market is removed from the European Commission’s list of markets susceptible
to ex ante regulation.

The following table lists the seven markets recommended by the EU in November 2007 along with the

equivalent 2020 recommended markets, and the operators designated with SMP by ComReg.

NTL Communications (Ireland) Limited and Chorus Communications Limited (now UPC); Colt Telecom Ireland Limited; Smart Telecom;
and Magnet Networks Limited.

(3) Equivalent to Wholesale Fixed Broadband Access market in the 2007 list.

ComReg’s most recent review of the markets for WLA and WCA and for PIA were concluded in January

2024. While the market reviews reaffirmed that remain subject to ex ante regulatory measures in the WLA market
(subject to certain adjustments), the WCA market is no longer subject to _ex ante regulation and the regulatory_
measures previously imposed in the WCA market no longer apply. In addition, ComReg found that we have
significant market power in relation to the market for access to certain physical infrastructure (such as poles and
ducts) and has therefore maintained ex ante regulation for access to those products and services.

**_Rate of return_**

On August 11, 2009, ComReg published a Decision (ComReg D03/09) on our regulatory assets lives,

extending the lives of the major asset classes. The decision took effect with respect to the 2009/2010. The change
in asset lives resulted in a difference in the treatment of assets in the regulatory accounts when compared with the


-----

statutory accounts. The regulatory accounts are used to set regulated wholesale prices. The effect of the decision
was to reduce our depreciation costs to be included in the regulatory accounts and potentially wholesale prices.

On June 23, 2023, ComReg published the fixed line WACC to 4.93% to be used in respect of our fixed

line regulated activities and a WACC of 5.08% in respect of eir’s mobile regulated activities (ComReg 23/56).
Any obligations imposed on us relating to cost recovery and price controls (including regulated wholesale prices)
imposed prior to the Effective Date and calculated using a previous WACC set by ComReg continue to apply
until such time as a price review is conducted and a new regulated price set.

**_Accounting separation_**

We are subject to an obligation of accounting separation in respect of the wholesale markets in which we

have been designated with SMP. Following consultation, ComReg published its Decision D08/10 (ComReg
10/67) in August 2010, directing measures relating to the content, format and level of granularity of our regulated
(separated) accounts. Our annual separated accounts are prepared in line with the requirements of this decision.

**_Key Performance Indicators_**

In June 2022, following a consultation process, ComReg published its Final Decision D04/22 (ComReg

22/49) directing that we report on a quarterly basis on key performance indicators for provision and repair in the
following regulated markets: (i) Regional WCA; and (ii) WLA. The key performance indicators must be published
on eir’s website on a quarterly basis. In January 2024, ComReg published its Final Decision D04/24 (ComReg
24/06) directing that we report on a quarterly basis on key performance indicators for physical infrastructure
assets. The key performance indicators must be published on eir’s website on a quarterly basis.

**_open eir Wholesale Regulatory Governance Model_**

The Independent Oversight Body published its Third and final annual report in May 2024. The IOB report

notes that eir’s governance arrangements are found to be adequate and eir is compliant with all aspects of the
RGM Undertakings as set out in the Settlement Agreement. The IOB will conclude in June 2024 and eir is
currently working on in-housing the functions of the IOB within eir.

**_Compliance_**

ComReg and other regulatory bodies occasionally make enquiries and conduct investigations concerning

our compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

**_Regulation of mobile services_**

_Mobile spectrum rights_

eir operates its mobile network using two mobile spectrum licenses. All licenses utilized by eir operate

on a technology agnostic basis.

In 2012, Meteor acquired rights under an additional license to use spectrum for the following spectrum:

      - 2x10MHz in the 800MHz band to 12 July 2030;

      - 2x10MHz in the 900MHz band to 12 July 2030; and

      - 2x15MHz in the 1800MHz band to 12 July 2030.

On June 1, 2017, ComReg published the results of the 3.6GHz band spectrum award (ComReg 17/46).

We successfully purchased a package of spectrum blocks including 85MHz of spectrum in the main urban areas
(Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford) and 80MHz of spectrum in the remainder of the country. The
total cost of the spectrum purchase for eir was €11.5 million.

In January 2023, Meteor acquired rights under an additional license for €56.7m to use spectrum for the

following spectrum until February 13, 2042:

      - 2x10MHz in the 700MHz band;

      - 2x5MHz in the 2100MHz band and 2x15MHz in the 2100MHz band to commence on expiry of

eir’s existing Licence from March 12, 2027, meaning that eir now has access to 2x20MHz of liberalized spectrum
in this band; and

      - 60MHz in the 2300MHz band.


-----

**_Mobile Termination Rates_**

Mobile Termination Rates (“MTRs”) are subject to price control based on a BU Pure LRIC model, where

the MTRs are set at the cost of the increment of the wholesale voice call termination service to the exclusion of a
mark-up for any common costs.

On December 18, 2020, the European Commission adopted the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU)

2021/654 supplementing Directive (EU) 201/1972 of the European Parliament and of the Council setting a single
maximum Union-wide mobile voice termination rate and a single maximum Union-wide fixed voice termination
rate (the “Delegated Act”). The Delegated Act took effect in Ireland from July 1, 2021 resulting in an amended
price control glidepath for MTRs to 0.20 cpm from January 1, 2024

**_International roaming tariffs_**

On November 25, 2015, Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2120 was adopted by the European Parliament and

the European Council. From June 15, 2017, roaming providers may no longer apply roaming tariffs to customers
throughout the European Union (known as Roam Like At Home), subject to a “fair use” policy applied in
accordance with the rules set out in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) (No. 2016/2286) of December
15, 2016 and possible derogations where the roaming provider demonstrates that the abolition of retail roaming
surcharges undermines the sustainability of its domestic charging model. Roam Like At Home measures also a
glide path in wholesale roaming price caps applicable from July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2032.

**_Overview_**

On April 18, 2017, EHIL and certain of its subsidiaries entered into the Senior Facilities Agreement with,

among others, certain financial institutions as “original lenders” as defined therein and Wilmington Trust
(London) Limited as agent (the “Senior Facility Agent”) and security agent (the “Security Agent”), which was
amended and restated by way of amendment and restatement agreements on August 27, 2019 and October 10,
2023.

The Senior Facilities Agreement comprises the following committed facilities:

##### • a €546 million senior secured term loan facility B (“Facility B”) (reduced from €1,450 million pursuant
to prepayments and amendments from time to time and fungible with a €200 million additional facility
availed pursuant to an additional facility notice dated February 8, 2024);

##### • a €600 million senior secured term loan facility B3 (“Facility B3”) (raised pursuant to an additional
facility notice dated March 25, 2024 and comprising approximately €445 million of cashlessly rolled
commitments from lenders under Facility B and approximately €155 million in new commitments); and

##### • a senior secured revolving credit facility of €50 million (reduced from €100 million pursuant to the
amendment and restatement agreement dated October 10, 2023, the “Revolving Facility” and, together
with Facility B and Facility B3, the “Facilities” and each a “Facility”).

The following is a summary of certain of the principal terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement. For the

purposes of this summary of the Senior Facilities Agreement, the term “Group” refers to EHIL and each of its
“restricted subsidiaries” from time to time.

**Structure**

The “original borrower” for each of Facility B, Facility B3 and the Revolving Facility, respectively, is

Eircom Finco S.à r.l. (“Finco”). Certain members of the Group may become an additional borrower under the
Revolving Facility, subject to meeting certain conditions as set out in the Senior Facilities Agreement.

Facility B and Facility B3 are denominated in euro. The Revolving Facility may be utilized in euro,

sterling, U.S. dollars and certain other currencies with the consent of all the lenders participating in the relevant
utilization under the Revolving Facility.


-----

The Revolving Facility may be utilized until the date falling one month prior to the “termination date”

of the Revolving Facility (such termination date being October 19, 2028).

**Interest and Fees**

The term loans made available under Facility B bear cash pay interest at a rate per annum equal to

EURIBOR (subject to a floor of zero), plus a margin of 3.25% per annum. The term loans made available under
Facility B3 bear cash pay interest at a rate per annum equal to EURIBOR (subject to a floor of zero), plus a margin
of 3.5% per annum The margins for Facility B and Facility B3 are each subject to a margin ratchet linked to certain
senior secured net leverage levels.

Loans under the Revolving Facility bear cash pay interest at rates per annum equal to, for revolving

utilizations denominated in currencies other than euro, LIBOR (subject to a floor of zero) or, for revolving
utilizations denominated in euro, EURIBOR (subject to a floor of zero), plus a margin of 2.75% per annum, subject
to a margin ratchet linked to senior secured net leverage levels.

Default interest on each of Facility B, Facility B3 and the Revolving Facility will, generally, be calculated

as an additional 1% on the overdue amount.

In respect of the Revolving Facility:

##### • a “commitment fee” is payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of the Revolving
Facility from (and including) April 19, 2017 to the end of the availability period applicable to the
Revolving Facility at a rate of 35% of the applicable margin for the Revolving Facility. Such commitment
fee is, generally, payable quarterly in arrears, on the last day of the availability period applicable to the
Revolving Facility and, if cancelled in full, on the cancelled amount of the relevant Revolving Facility
lender’s commitment at the time the cancellation becomes effective; and

##### • a “utilization fee” is payable in respect of each outstanding loan under the Revolving Facility at a rate of
(i) 0.50% per annum on the amount of each Revolving Facility lender’s participation in each outstanding
Revolving Facility loan on each day on which the applicable base currency amount of all outstanding
Revolving Facility loans is greater than 66 2/3% of the total Revolving Facility commitments and (ii)
0.25% per annum on the amount of each Revolving Facility lender’s participation in each outstanding
Revolving Facility loan on each day on which the applicable base currency amount of all outstanding
Revolving Facility loans is greater than 33 1/3% of the total Revolving Facility commitments but less
than or equal to 66 2/3% of the total Revolving Facility commitments. Such utilization fee is, generally,
payable quarterly in arrears, on the termination date for the Revolving Facility and, in respect of any
Revolving Facility lender whose participation in all outstanding Revolving Facility loans is being repaid
in full, on the day on which such Revolving Facility lender’s participation in all outstanding Revolving
Facility loans becomes repayable. No utilization fee is payable where the aggregate base currency amount
of all outstanding Revolving Facility loans is less than 33 1/3% of the total Revolving Facility
commitments.

EHIL is required to pay customary agency fees to each of the Senior Facility Agent and the Security

Agent in connection with the Senior Facilities Agreement.

**Repayments**

Facility B has a final maturity date of May 15, 2026.

Facility B3 has a final maturity date of May 15, 2029.

“—Permitted Hedge Counterparty Enforcement after Insolvency Event” below.

The term “Permitted Hedging Payment,” generally, refers to any Payment by a Debtor to any Hedge

Counterparty in respect of the Hedging Liabilities which is then due to that Hedge Counterparty under any
Hedging Agreement in accordance with the terms of that Hedging Agreement:

(a) if the Payment is a scheduled Payment arising under the relevant Hedging Agreement;

(b) to the extent that the relevant Debtor’s obligation to make the Payment arises as a result of the

(iii) any provision of a Hedging Agreement which is similar in meaning and effect to any
provision listed in paragraphs (A) or (B) above (if the Hedging Agreement is not
based on an ISDA Master Agreement);

(c) to the extent that the relevant Debtor’s obligation to make the Payment arises from a Non
Credit Related Close Out;

(d) to the extent that:

(i) the relevant Debtor’s obligation to make the Payment arises from a Credit Related
Close Out in relation to that Hedging Agreement; and

(ii) no Senior Event of Default or Senior Secured Notes Event of Default is continuing at
the time of that Payment;

similar or equivalent action by a member of the Group and:


-----

(i) such close-out, termination or other similar or equivalent action is not prohibited by
any Secured Debt Document; and

(ii) no Senior Event of Default or Senior Secured Notes Event of Default is continuing at
the time of that Payment; or

(g) generally, if the Instructing Group gives prior consent to the Payment being made,

_provided that a Payment contemplated to be made to a Hedge Counterparty will not be a Permitted_

Hedging Payment if any scheduled Payment due from that Hedge Counterparty to a Debtor under a Hedging
Agreement to which they are both party is due and unpaid.

Failure by a Debtor to make a Payment to a Hedge Counterparty which results solely from the restriction

on the Debtor making that Payment where there is a scheduled payment due from a Hedge Counterparty, as
described in the proviso in the paragraph above, shall not result in a default (howsoever described) in respect of
that Debtor under that Hedging Agreement or any other Senior Secured Finance Document or Second Lien
Finance Document (as applicable).

_Amendments and waivers: Hedging Agreements_

The Hedge Counterparties are not permitted to amend or waive any term of the Hedging Agreements

unless the amendment or waiver is in accordance with the terms of that Hedging Agreement and does not breach
any term of the Intercreditor Agreement.

_Security and Guarantees: Hedge Counterparties_

The Hedge Counterparties may not take, accept or receive the benefit of any Security, guarantee,

indemnity or other assurance against loss from any member of the Group in respect of the Hedging Liabilities
other than:

##### • the Transaction Security;

 • any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss contained in, generally:

###### • the Intercreditor Agreement or any substantially equivalent provision in a Permitted Senior
Secured Facility Agreement;

###### • any Common Assurance; or

 • the relevant Hedging Agreement as long as it is no greater in extent than any of those referred
to in the foregoing two points above;

##### • to the extent such Security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss has (or could have) been
granted in compliance with or as otherwise contemplated as generally set out under the caption “—
_Restrictions Relating to Senior Secured Creditor Liabilities—Security and Guarantees: Senior Secured_
_Creditors” above; and_

##### • the indemnities contained in the ISDA Master Agreements (in the case of a Hedging Agreement which
is based on an ISDA Master Agreement) or any indemnities which, in terms of the rights to which they
give rise, are similar in meaning and effect to those indemnities (in the case of a Hedging Agreement
which is not based on an ISDA Master Agreement).

_Restriction on Enforcement—Hedge Counterparties_

Other than as generally described below under the captions “—Permitted Hedge Counterparty

_Enforcement” and “—Required Hedge Counterparty Enforcement,” Hedge Counterparties are not permitted to_
take any Enforcement Action in respect of the Hedging Liabilities or any hedging transactions under the Hedging
Agreements at any time.

_Permitted Hedge Counterparty Enforcement_

In certain circumstances as set out in the Intercreditor Agreement a Hedge Counterparty is entitled to

terminate or close out a hedging transaction prior to its stated maturity.

In addition, if a Debtor has defaulted on a Payment due under a Hedging Agreement and the default has

continued unwaived for more than 5 Business Days after notice of the default has been given to the Security


-----

Agent, the relevant Hedge Counterparty may, to the extent it is able to do so under the relevant Hedging
Agreement, terminate or close out in whole or in part any hedging transaction under that Hedging Agreement,
and, until such time as the Security Agent has given notice to that Hedge Counterparty that the Transaction
Security is being enforced (or that any formal steps are being taken to enforce the Transaction Security), shall be
entitled to exercise any right it might otherwise have to sue for, commence or join legal or arbitration proceedings
against any Debtor to recover any Hedging Liabilities due under that Hedging Agreement.

To the extent permitted under applicable law, after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to

any Obligor or Material Subsidiary, each Hedge Counterparty shall be entitled to exercise any right it may
otherwise have in respect of that member of the Group to:

##### • prematurely close out or terminate any Hedging Liabilities of that member of the Group;

 • make a demand under any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss given by that member of
the Group in respect of any Hedging Liabilities;

##### • exercise any right of set off or take or receive any Payment in respect of any Hedging Liabilities of that
member of the Group; or

##### • claim and prove in the liquidation of that member of the Group for the Hedging Liabilities owing to it.

_Required Hedge Counterparty Enforcement_

Generally, and subject to certain exceptions as set out in the Intercreditor Agreement, a Hedge

Counterparty shall promptly terminate or close-out in full any hedging transaction under all or any of the
Hedging Agreements to which it is party prior to their stated maturity, following:

(a) the occurrence of a Senior Acceleration Event or a Senior Secured Notes Acceleration Event
and delivery to it of a notice from the Security Agent that a Senior Acceleration Event or
Senior Secured Notes Acceleration Event (as applicable) has occurred; and

(b) delivery to it of a subsequent notice from the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of an
Instructing Group) instructing it to do so.

If a Hedge Counterparty is entitled to terminate or close out any hedging transaction due to a payment

default as described in the second paragraph under the caption “—Permitted Hedge Counterparty Enforcement”
above, but the Hedge Counterparty has not terminated or closed out the hedging transaction, that Hedge
Counterparty is required to promptly terminate or close out in full the relevant hedging transaction upon the
request of the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of the Instructing Group).

**_Restrictions relating to Second Lien Liabilities_**

Until the Senior Secured Discharge Date, EHIL shall not (and shall ensure that no member of the

“—Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing of Claims” below) exercise any right it may otherwise have in respect of
that member of the Group to:

(a) accelerate any of that member of the Group’s Subordinated Liabilities or declare them
prematurely due and payable or payable on demand;

(b) make a demand under any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss given by that
member of the Group in respect of any Subordinated Liabilities;


-----

(c) exercise any right of set-off or take or receive any Payment in respect of any Subordinated
Liabilities of that member of the Group; or

(d) claim and prove in the liquidation, administration or other insolvency proceedings of that
member of the Group for the Subordinated Liabilities owing to it,

but shall not take any other Enforcement Action.

**_Restrictions on Intra-Group Liabilities_**

Prior to the Final Discharge Date, the Debtors shall not, and shall procure that no other member of the

Group will, make any Payment of the Intra-Group Liabilities at any time unless:

(a) that Payment is permitted as generally described under the caption “—Permitted Intra-Group
_Liabilities Payments” below; or_

(b) the taking or receipt of that Payment is permitted as generally described under the caption “—
_Permitted Intra-Group Lender Enforcement” below._

_Permitted Intra-Group Liabilities Payments_

The Debtors may, directly or indirectly, make Payments in respect of the Intra-Group Liabilities

(whether of principal, interest or otherwise), including by way of set-off or conversion to equity of the relevant
member of the Group, at any time, provided that Payments in respect of the Intra-Group Liabilities may not be
made if, at the time of the Payment, an Acceleration Event has occurred and is continuing, unless:

(a) an Instructing Group consents to that Payment being made;

(b) in relation to each Prior Ranking Financing Agreement that prohibits the Payment being made,
the Required Creditor Consent has been obtained; or

(c) that Payment is made to facilitate the Payment of:

(i) prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Senior Secured Creditor Liabilities,
the Hedging Liabilities, the Agent Liabilities or the Arranger Liabilities;

(ii) on or after the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Second Lien Creditor Liabilities
and the Second Lien Agent Liabilities; or

(iii) Liabilities owed to the Security Agent.

_Security and Guarantees: Intra-Group Liabilities_

Prior to the Final Discharge Date, the Intra-Group Lenders may not take, accept or receive the benefit of

any Security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of the Intra-Group Liabilities unless:

##### • that security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss is not prohibited by the Prior Ranking
Financing Agreements; or

##### • to the extent prohibited, the Required Creditor Consent has been obtained.

_Permitted Intra-Group Lender Enforcement_

After the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, each Intra-Group Lender may (unless otherwise directed

by the Security Agent or unless the Security Agent has taken, or has given notice that it intends to take, action on
behalf of that Intra-Group Lender), exercise any right it may otherwise have against that member of the Group to:

##### • accelerate any of that member of the Group’s Intra-Group Liabilities or declare them prematurely due
and payable or payable on demand;

##### • make a demand under any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss given by that member of
the Group in respect of any Intra-Group Liabilities;

##### • exercise any right of set off or take or receive any Payment in respect of any Intra-Group Liabilities of
that member of the Group; or


-----

##### • claim and prove in the liquidation, administration or other insolvency proceedings of that member of the
Group for the Intra-Group Liabilities owing to it.

**_Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing of Claims_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, among other things, after the occurrence of an Insolvency

Event, any party to the Intercreditor Agreement entitled to receive a distribution out of the assets of that Obligor
or Material Subsidiary in respect of Liabilities owed to that party shall, to the extent it is able to do so, direct the
person responsible for the distribution of the assets of that member of the Group to pay that distribution to the
Security Agent until the Liabilities owing to the Secured Parties have been paid in full. In this respect, the Security
Agent shall apply distributions paid to it as generally described under the caption “—Application of Proceeds”
below.

Subject to certain exceptions as set out in the Intercreditor Agreement, to the extent that any member of

the Group’s Liabilities are discharged by way of set-off (mandatory or otherwise) after the occurrence of an
Insolvency Event, any Creditor which benefited from that set-off shall pay an amount equal to the amount of the
Liabilities owed to it which are discharged by that set-off to the Security Agent for application as generally
described under the caption “—Application of Proceeds” below.

If the Security Agent or any other Secured Party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in

respect of any of the Liabilities, the Liabilities will not be reduced by that distribution until and except to the
extent that the realization proceeds are actually applied towards the Liabilities.

Generally, after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, each Creditor irrevocably authorizes the

Security Agent, on its behalf, to:

(a) take any Enforcement Action (in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement)
against that member of the Group;

(b) demand, sue, prove and give receipt for any or all of that member of Group’s Liabilities;

(c) collect and receive all distributions on, or on account of, any or all of that member of Group’s
Liabilities; and

(d) file claims, take proceedings and do all other things the Security Agent considers reasonably
necessary to recover that member of Group’s Liabilities.

Generally, each Creditor will (i) do all things that the Security Agent reasonably requests in order to give

effect to the matters referred to in this “—Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing of Claims” section and (ii) if the
Security Agent is not entitled to take any of the actions contemplated by this “—Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing
_of Claims” section or if the Security Agent requests that a Creditor take that action, undertake that action itself in_
accordance with the instructions of the Security Agent or grant a power of attorney to the Security Agent (on such
terms as the Security Agent may reasonably require) to enable the Security Agent to take such action.

**_Turnover_**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that if any Creditor receives or

recovers from any member of the Group:

(a) any Payment or distribution of, or on account of, or in relation to, any of the Liabilities which
is not a payment permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement or made in accordance with the
provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement generally described under the caption “—
_Application of Proceeds” below;_

(b) other than as referred to in the second paragraph under the caption “—Effect of Insolvency
_Event; Filing of Claims” above, any amount by way of set-off in respect of any of the_
Liabilities owed to it which does not give effect to a payment permitted under the Intercreditor
Agreement:

(c) any amount:

(i) on account of, or in relation to, any of the Liabilities after the occurrence of a
Distress Event or as a result of any other litigation or proceedings against a member
of the Group (other than after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event); or


-----

(ii) by way of set-off in respect of any of the Liabilities owed to it after the occurrence of
a Distress Event,

other than, in each case, any amount received or recovered in accordance with the provisions
set out below under the caption “—Application of Proceeds;”

(d) the proceeds of any enforcement of any Transaction Security except as generally described
under the caption “—Application of Proceeds” below; or

(e) other than as referred to in the second paragraph under the caption “—Effect of Insolvency
_Event; Filing of Claims” above, any distribution in cash or in kind or Payment of, or on_
account of or in relation to, any of the Liabilities owed by any member of Group which is not
in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement as generally described under
the caption “—Application of Proceeds” below and which is made as a result of, or after, the
occurrence of an Insolvency Event,

that Creditor will, subject to certain exceptions: (i) in relation to receipts and recoveries not received or recovered
by way of set-off (x) hold an amount of that receipt or recovery equal to the Relevant Liabilities (or if less, the
amount received or recovered) on trust for the Security Agent and promptly pay that amount to the Security Agent
for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and (y) promptly pay an amount equal
to the amount (if any) by which the receipt or recovery exceeds the Relevant Liabilities to the Security Agent for
application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and (ii) in relation to receipts and
recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an amount equal to that recovery to the Security
Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Enforcement of Security_**

_Enforcement Instructions_

The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security unless instructed otherwise by:

(i) the Instructing Group; or (ii) if required under the provisions described in the third paragraph of this caption
_“—Enforcement Instructions” below, the Second Lien Agent or Second Lien Notes Trustee (acting on the_
instructions of the Majority Second Lien Creditors as applicable).

Subject to the Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms: (i) the

Instructing Group; or (ii) to the extent permitted to enforce or to require the enforcement of the Transaction
Security prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date as generally described under the caption “—Restrictions
_Relating to Second Lien Liabilities—Permitted Second Lien Enforcement,” a Second Lien Agent or Second Lien_
Notes Trustee (acting on the instructions of the Majority Second Lien Creditors), may give or refrain from giving,
instructions to the Security Agent to enforce, or refrain from enforcing, the Transaction Security as they see fit.

Prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date: (i) if the Instructing Group has instructed the Security Agent

not to enforce or to cease enforcing the Transaction Security; or (ii) in the absence of instructions from the
Instructing Group, and, in each case, the Instructing Group has not required any Debtor to make a Distressed
Disposal, the Security Agent shall give effect to any instructions to enforce the Transaction Security which the
Majority Second Lien Creditors are then entitled to give to the Security Agent as generally described under the
caption “—Restrictions Relating to Second Lien Liabilities—Permitted Second Lien Enforcement” above.

No Secured Party shall have any independent power to enforce any Transaction Security or to exercise

any rights or powers arising under the Security Documents except through the Security Agent.

_Manner of Enforcement_

If the Transaction Security is being enforced as set forth above under the caption “—Enforcement

_Instructions,” the Security Agent shall enforce the Transaction Security in such manner (including, without_
limitation, the selection of any administrator of any Debtor to be appointed by the Security Agent): (a) as an
Instructing Group shall instruct; (b) prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date, generally, if the Security Agent
has received instructions from the Majority Second Lien Creditors and the Instructing Group has not given
instructions as to the manner of enforcement of the Transaction Security, as the Majority Second Lien Creditors
shall instruct; or, (c) in the absence of any such instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit.

_Exercise of Voting Rights_

Each Creditor and each Subordinated Creditor agrees (to the fullest extent permitted by law at the relevant

time) with the Security Agent that it will cast its vote in any proposal put to the vote by, or under the supervision


-----

of, any judicial or supervisory authority in respect of any insolvency, pre-insolvency or rehabilitation or similar
proceedings relating to any member of the Group as instructed by the Security Agent. Generally, the Security
Agent shall give instructions for the purposes of this paragraph as directed by an Instructing Group.

_Waiver of Rights_

To the extent permitted under applicable law and subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement,

each of the Secured Parties and the Debtors waives all rights it may otherwise have to require that the Transaction
Security be enforced in any particular order or manner or at any particular time, or that any sum received or
recovered from any person, or by virtue of the enforcement of any of the Transaction Security or of any other
security interest, which is capable of being applied in or towards discharge of any of the Secured Obligations, is
so applied.

_Consultation Period_

Subject to the following paragraph, before giving any instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the

Transaction Security or take any other Enforcement Action, the Agent(s) of the Creditors represented in the
Instructing Group concerned (and, if applicable, any relevant Hedge Counterparties) shall consult with each other
Agent, each other Hedge Counterparty and the Security Agent in good faith about the instructions to be given by
the Instructing Group for a period of up to ten (10) Business Days from the date on which details of the proposed
instructions are received by such Agents, Hedge Counterparties and the Security Agent (or such shorter period as
each other Agent, each Hedge Counterparty and the Security Agent shall agree) (the “Consultation Period”), and
only following the expiry of a Consultation Period, shall the Instructing Group be entitled to give any instructions
to the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security or take any other Enforcement Action.

No Agent or Hedge Counterparty shall be obliged to consult as contemplated in the paragraph above

and an Instructing Group shall be entitled to give any instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the
Transaction Security or take any other Enforcement Action prior to the end of a Consultation Period (in each
case provided that such instructions are consistent with any applicable requirements of the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Security Documents) if:

(a) the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an Insolvency Event; or

(b) the Instructing Group or any Agent of the Creditors represented in the Instructing Group
determines in good faith (and notifies each Agent, each Hedge Counterparty and the Security
Agent) that to enter into such consultation and delay the commencement of enforcement of the
Transaction Security could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on (x) the
Security Agent’s ability to enforce any of the Transaction Security or (y) the realization
proceeds of any enforcement of the Transaction Security.

**_Proceeds of Disposals_**

_Non-Distressed Disposals_

Generally, the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized and instructed to, in respect of a disposal of, or

in respect of, an asset of a Debtor or an asset which is subject to Transaction Security:

(a) release any Transaction Security and/or any other claim (including relating to a Debt
Document) over the asset; and

(b) where the asset consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor, release any Transaction Security
and/or any other claim (including relating to a Debt Document) over that Debtor or its assets
and (if any) the Subsidiaries of that Debtor and their respective assets,

_provided that, generally, such disposal is not a “Distressed Disposal” (as defined below) (a “Non-Distressed_
Disposal”).

The Security Agent is irrevocably authorized and instructed to enter into and deliver such documentation

as the Security Agent considers necessary to give effect to any release described in the paragraph above.

If any proceeds from a Non-Distressed Disposal are required to be applied in mandatory prepayment of

any of the Secured Obligations or to be offered to Secured Parties pursuant to the terms of the relevant Debt
Documents then such proceeds shall be applied in or towards Payment of such Secured Obligations or shall be
offered to the relevant Secured Parties in accordance with the terms of the relevant Debt Documents and the
consent of any other party to the Intercreditor Agreement shall not be required for that application.


-----

_Distressed Disposals_

A “Distressed Disposal” is a disposal of an asset or shares of, or other financial securities issued by, a

member of the Group which is, generally, (a) being effected at the request of an Instructing Group in circumstances
where the Transaction Security has become enforceable, (b) being effected by enforcement of Transaction
Security or (c) effected after the occurrence of a Distress Event by a Debtor to a person or persons which is not a
member of the Group.

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected, the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (at the cost of

the relevant Debtor or EHIL):

(a) to release the Transaction Security or any other claim over that asset and execute and deliver
or enter into any release of that Transaction Security or claim and issue any letters of noncrystallization of any floating charge or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of
the Security Agent, be considered necessary or desirable;

(b) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor to release:

(i) that Debtor and any Subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its Borrowing
Liabilities, its Guarantee Liabilities and its Other Liabilities;

(ii) any Transaction Security granted by that Debtor or any Subsidiary of that Debtor
over any of its assets; and

(iii) any other claim of an Intra-Group Lender, a Subordinated Creditor or another Debtor
over that Debtor’s assets or over the assets of any Subsidiary of that Debtor,

on behalf of the relevant Creditors and Debtors;

(c) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any Holding Company of a
Debtor, to release:

(i) that Holding Company and any Subsidiary of that Holding Company from all or any
part of its Borrowing Liabilities, its Guarantees Liabilities and its Other Liabilities;

(ii) any Transaction Security granted by that Holding Company or any Subsidiary of that
Holding Company over any of its assets; and

(iii) any other claim of an Intra-Group Lender, a Subordinated Creditor or another Debtor
over the assets of that Holding Company or any Subsidiary of that Holding
Company,

on behalf of the relevant Creditors and Debtors;

(d) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding
company of a Debtor and, generally, the Security Agent decides to dispose of all or any part of
the Liabilities or the Debtor Liabilities owed by that Debtor or Holding Company or any
Subsidiary of that Debtor or Holding Company:

(i) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does
not intend that any transferee of those Liabilities or Debtor Liabilities (the
“Transferee”) will be treated as a Secured Creditor or a Secured Party for the
purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement), to execute and deliver or enter into any
agreement to dispose of all or part of those Liabilities or Debtor Liabilities, provided
that, notwithstanding any other provision of any Debt Document, the Transferee shall
not be treated as a Secured Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the
Intercreditor Agreement; and

(ii) (if the Security Agent does intend that any Transferee will be treated as a Secured
Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement), to
execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of all (and not part only)
of the Liabilities owed to the Secured Creditors and all or part of any other Liabilities
and the Debtor Liabilities, on behalf of, in each case, the relevant Creditors and
Debtors;


-----

(e) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding
company of a Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Security Agent decides to transfer to
another Debtor (the “Receiving Entity”) all or any part of the Disposed Entity’s obligations or
any obligations of any subsidiary of that Disposed Entity in respect of the Intra-Group
Liabilities or the Debtor Liabilities, to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to:

(i) agree to the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those Intra-Group
Liabilities or Debtor Liabilities on behalf of the relevant Intra-Group Lenders and
Debtors to which those obligations are owed and on behalf of the Debtors which owe
those obligations; and

(ii) (if the Receiving Entity is a Holding Company of the Disposed Entity which is also a
guarantor of Secured Liabilities) to accept the transfer of all or part of the obligations
in respect of those Intra-Group Liabilities or Debtor Liabilities on behalf of the
Receiving Entity or Receiving Entities to which the obligations in respect of those
Intra-Group Liabilities or Debtor Liabilities are to be transferred.

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of Liabilities or

Debtor Liabilities disposed of in accordance with paragraph (iv) above) shall be paid to the Security Agent for
application as generally described under the caption “—Application of Proceeds” below as if those proceeds were
the proceeds of an enforcement of the Transaction Security and, to the extent that any disposal of Liabilities or
Debtor Liabilities has occurred, as if that disposal of Liabilities or Debtor Liabilities had not occurred.

In the case of a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of Liabilities in accordance with paragraph (iv) above),

effected by, or at the request of, the Security Agent, the Security Agent shall take reasonable care to obtain a fair
market price in the prevailing market conditions (though the Security Agent shall not have any obligation to
postpone any such Distressed Disposal or disposal of Liabilities in order to achieve a higher price).

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Second Lien Creditors are entitled

to give, and have given, instructions under the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement generally described in
the third paragraph under the caption “—Enforcement of Security—Enforcement Instructions” above, or the
provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement generally described under the caption “—Enforcement of Security—
_Manner of Enforcement” above, the Security Agent is not authorized to release any Debtor, Subsidiary or Holding_
Company from any Borrowing Liabilities or Guarantee Liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor unless
those Borrowing Liabilities or Guarantee Liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities will be paid (or
repaid) in full following that release.

If, before the Second Lien Discharge Date, a Distressed Disposal is being effected such that the Second

Lien Liabilities and Transaction Security over shares in a Second Lien Borrower or issuer of Second Lien Notes
or assets of a Second Lien Borrower, issuer of Second Lien Notes or Second Lien Guarantor will be released as
contemplated under paragraphs (i)-(v) above of this “—Distressed Disposals” section, it is a further condition to
the release that either:

(a) each Second Lien Agent and each Second Lien Notes Trustee (as applicable) has approved the
release; or

(b) where shares or assets of a Second Lien Borrower, issuer of Second Lien Notes or a Second
Lien Guarantor are sold:

(i) the proceeds of such sale or disposal are in cash (or substantially in cash) and/or
other marketable securities or, if the proceeds of such sale or disposal are not in cash
(or substantially in cash) and/or other marketable securities, the requirements of
paragraph (C)(2) below are satisfied; and

(ii) all claims of the Senior Secured Creditors (other than in relation to performance
bonds or guarantees or similar instruments) against a member of the Group (if any)
all of whose shares are pledged in favor of the Secured Parties are sold or disposed of
pursuant to such Enforcement Action, are unconditionally released and discharged or
sold or disposed of concurrently with such sale (and are not assumed by the
purchaser or one of its Affiliates), and all Security under the Security Documents in
respect of the assets that are sold or disposed of is simultaneously and
unconditionally released and discharged concurrently with such sale, provided that in
the event of a sale or disposal of any such claim (instead of a release or discharge):


-----

(A) where the Senior Secured Creditors (or any group or class of Senior Secured
Creditors) constitute the Instructing Group, the Senior Agent(s) and Senior
Secured Notes Trustee(s):

(I) determine acting reasonably and in good faith that the Senior
Secured Creditors will recover more than if such claim was
released or discharged but is nevertheless less than the outstanding
Senior Secured Liabilities; and

(II) serve a notice on the Security Agent notifying the Security Agent
of the same; and

(B) where the Second Lien Creditors constitute the Instructing Group, the
Second Lien Agent(s) and the Second Lien Notes Trustee(s):

(I) determine, acting reasonably and in good faith, that the Secured
Parties (collectively) will recover more than if such claim was
released or discharged but is nevertheless less than the outstanding
Priority Secured Liabilities; and

(II) serve a notice on the Security Agent notifying the Security Agent
of the same,

in which case the Security Agent shall be entitled immediately to sell and
transfer such claim to such purchaser (or an affiliate of such purchaser) and
the consideration for such sale or transfer may be in the form of non-cash
consideration by way of: (x) where the Senior Secured Creditors constitute the
Instructing Group, the Senior Secured Creditors bidding by an appropriate
mechanic all or part of the Senior Secured Liabilities (such that the Senior
Secured Liabilities would, on completion, be discharged to the extent of an
amount equal to the amount of the offer made by the relevant Senior Secured
Creditors); or (y) where the Second Lien Creditors constitute the Instructing
Group, the Second Lien Creditors bidding by an appropriate mechanic all or
part of the Second Lien Liabilities (such that the Second Lien Liabilities
would, on completion, be discharged to the extent of an amount equal to the
amount of the offer made by the relevant Second Lien Creditors); and

(C) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is made:

(I) pursuant to a competitive sales process; or

(II) where an independent investment bank or an internationally
recognized firm of accountants or a reputable independent third
party professional firm which is regularly engaged in providing
valuations in respect of the relevant type and size of the assets
concerned, in each case selected by the Security Agent, has
delivered an opinion (including an enterprise valuation of the
Group which can be relied upon by the Security Agent and
disclosed to the Senior Secured Creditors and the Second Lien
Creditors on a non-reliance basis) in respect of such sale or
disposal that the amount received in connection therewith is fair
from a financial point of view taking into account all relevant
circumstances including the method of enforcement provided that
the liability of such investment bank or internationally recognized
firm of accountants in giving such opinion may be limited to the
amount of its fees in respect of such engagement.

For the purposes of the actions described in paragraphs (iv) and (v) of the second paragraph of this “—

_Distressed Disposals” section and those described in the fourth and sixth paragraphs of this “—Distressed_
_Disposals” section, the Security Agent shall act: (a) if the relevant Distressed Disposal is being effected by way_
of enforcement of the Transaction Security, in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement


-----

generally described under the caption “—Enforcement of Security—Manner of Enforcement” above; and (b) in
any other case, in such manner as an Instructing Group shall instruct or, in the absence of any such instructions,
as the Security Agent sees fit.

**_Application of Proceeds_**

_Order of Application_

The Intercreditor Agreement generally provides that all amounts from time to time received or

recovered by the Security Agent pursuant to the terms of any Debt Document or in connection with the
realization or enforcement of all or any part of the Transaction Security (for the purposes of this “—Application
_of Proceeds” section, the “Recoveries”) shall be applied at any time as the Security Agent (in its discretion) sees_
fit, to the extent permitted by applicable law (and subject to the provisions of this “—Application of Proceeds”
section), in the following order of priority:

Liabilities), the Security Agent, any Receiver or any Delegate and any Second Lien Creditor
Representative (in respect of the Second Lien Agent Liabilities) on a pari passu basis;

_Equalization_

The Intercreditor Agreement generally provides that if, for any reason, any Senior Secured Liabilities

remain unpaid after the Enforcement Date and the resulting losses are not borne by the Senior Secured Creditors
in the proportions which their respective exposures at the Enforcement Date bore to the aggregate exposures of
all the Senior Secured Creditors at the Enforcement Date, the Senior Secured Creditors will make such payments
amongst themselves as the Security Agent shall require to put the Senior Secured Creditors in such a position that
(after taking into account such payments) those losses are borne in those proportions.

**_Consents, Amendments and Override_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, subject to certain exceptions (including as described below

under this “—Consents, Amendments and Override” caption) and customary disenfranchisement provisions, the
Intercreditor Agreement and/or a Security Document may be amended or waived only with the written consent
of:

(a) the Senior Facility Agent (acting on the instructions of the requisite Senior Lenders in

Counterparty under the applicable Hedging Agreement, as notified by EHIL to the Security
Agent at the time of the relevant amendment or waiver); and

(g) EHIL.

Any amendment, waiver or consent that only affects one or more classes of Creditors, and which does

not materially and adversely affect the interests of the other classes of Creditors, may be approved only with the
consent of the Agent, a Hedge Counterparty or Agents or Hedge Counterparties (as the case may be) acting on
behalf of the affected class or classes, and EHIL

Any term of the Intercreditor Agreement or a Security Document may be amended or waived by EHIL

in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the “Securities Act”). See “Notice to Investors.”

The terms of the Notes include those stated in the Indenture and will not incorporate provisions by reference

to, or otherwise be subject to, the Trust Indenture Act. The Notes will be subject to all such terms pursuant to the

From time to time, subject to the Issuer’s compliance with the covenants described under the headings “—

except in respect of any of the following terms which shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate supplied to the
Trustee (“Additional Notes”):

(1) the title of such Additional Notes;

(2) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Notes;

(3) the date or dates on which such Additional Notes have been issued;

(4) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating) at which such Additional Notes shall bear interest

and, if applicable, the interest rate basis, formula or other method of determining such interest rate or rates, the
date or dates from which such interest shall accrue, the interest payment dates on which such interest shall be
payable or the method by which such dates will be determined, the record dates for the determination of holders

(5) the currency or currencies in which such Additional Notes shall be denominated and the currency in

Additional Notes.

The Notes issued in this offering and, if issued, any Additional Notes will be treated as a single class for all

purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to waivers, amendments, redemptions
and offers to purchase and all other matters which are not specifically distinguished for such series. If Additional
Notes are not fungible with the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Additional Notes will have
separate CUSIP and ISIN numbers. Unless the context otherwise requires, in this “Description of the Notes,”
references to the “Notes” include the Notes and any Additional Notes that are actually issued.

**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes**

Principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts (as defined below), if any, on the Global Note

(as defined below) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents; provided that
all such payments with respect to Notes represented by a Global Note registered in the name of or held by a
nominee of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to the account specified by the Holder or Holders thereof.

Principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities (“Definitive

Registered Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents in London,
United Kingdom or Dublin maintained for such purposes. In addition, interest on the Definitive Registered Notes
may be paid by bank transfer to the person entitled thereto as shown on the register for the Definitive Registered
Notes. See “—Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes.”

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents (each a “Paying Agent”) for the Notes in London, United

Kingdom (the “Principal Paying Agent”). The initial Principal Paying Agent for the Notes will be Deutsche Bank
AG, London Branch, in London.


-----

The Issuer will also maintain one or more registrars (each, a “Registrar”) and a transfer agent in London,

United Kingdom. The initial Registrar will be Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. in Luxembourg, and the initial
transfer agent will be Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, in London. The Registrar and the transfer agent will
maintain a register reflecting ownership of Definitive Registered Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and
will make payments on and facilitate transfers of Definitive Registered Notes on behalf of the Issuer, as applicable.
Each transfer agent shall perform the functions of a transfer agent.

The Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or transfer agent for the Notes without prior notice to the

Holders of the Notes. The Issuer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar
in respect of the Notes. For so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange
and the rules of The International Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish a notice of any change of
Registrar or transfer agent, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, on the official website of The
International Stock Exchange (www.tisegroup.com/).

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Notes offered hereby will initially be issued in the form of a registered note in global form without

interest coupons, as follows:

   - The Notes will be sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act and
will initially be represented by a global note in registered form without interest coupons attached (the
“Global Note”).

   - The Global Note will, upon issuance, be deposited with and registered in the name of the common
depositary or a nominee on its behalf for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Note (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have

accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants. Ownership
of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and
certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under “Notice to Investors.” In addition,
transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or participants in Clearstream will be effected
by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules
and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and their respective participants.

Prior to 40 days after the date of initial issuance of the Notes, ownership of Book-Entry Interests in the Global

Note will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or persons who hold interests
through Euroclear or Clearstream, and any sale or transfer of such interest to U.S. persons shall not be permitted
during such period.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon

transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a
Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it
will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of €100,000

aggregate principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the Registrar of
instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Indenture. It
is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, from the participant that owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued
in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the
Issuer to be in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions
on transfer summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer Restrictions.”

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be

transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000 in aggregate principal
amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the
Indenture requires the transferring or exchanging holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements
and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream,
as applicable, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any taxes, duties and governmental charges


-----

in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the
Holder, other than any taxes, duties and governmental charges payable in connection with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer or exchange of the Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of the Notes to be redeemed

in part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date applicable

to the Notes; or

(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of

Control Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent and the Paying Agents will be entitled to treat the

Holder of a Note as the owner of it for all purposes.

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

As of the date of this offering memorandum, all of the Company’s Subsidiaries are Restricted Subsidiaries.

In the circumstances described below under “—Certain Definitions—Unrestricted Subsidiary,” the Company

will be permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries (other than the Issuer and eircom Limited (Jersey)) as
Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the
Indenture.

**Guarantees**

The obligations of the Issuer pursuant to the Notes, including any payment obligation resulting from a Change

of Control, will (subject to the Agreed Security Principles) be guaranteed, jointly and severally on a senior basis,
by the Company and certain subsidiaries of the Company (each a “Guarantor” and such guarantee, a “Guarantee”).
The Guarantors are guarantors under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the 2024 Notes Indenture, the 2026 Notes
Indenture and the 2027 Notes Indenture.

The initial Guarantors will be eircom Holdings (Ireland) Limited, eircom Limited (Ireland), Eircom Finco

S.à.r.l, Irish Telecommunications Investments DAC, Eircom (UK) Limited, Meteor Ireland Holdings LLC, eircom
Limited (Jersey) and Meteor Mobile Holdings Limited.

As of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, the Guarantors, represented 97.11% and 78.07% of

the Group’s consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and assets, respectively.

In addition, as described below under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees” and subject to the

Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, each Restricted Subsidiary of the Company that
guarantees the Senior Facilities Agreement, Public Debt or certain other indebtedness shall also enter into a
supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Notes and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under

the Senior Facility Agreement, the 2024 Notes, the 2026 Notes, the 2027 Notes and the Notes. The Agreed
Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees, where, among other things, such grant would
be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance, corporate benefit,
fraudulent preference, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims and similar matters.

Each Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations

subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or
any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required under the Agreed Security Principles
to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s
obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a


-----

Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our
_Structure—The insolvency laws of Ireland or the jurisdiction of incorporation or formation of each of the_
_Guarantors may not be as favorable to holders of Notes as U.S. insolvency laws or those of another jurisdiction_
_with which you may be familiar.”_

**_Release of Guarantees_**

The Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and release upon:

   - except for the Guarantee given by the Company and eircom Limited (Jersey) (the “Parent Guarantees”),
a sale, disposition, exchange or other transfer (including by way of consolidation, merger, amalgamation
or combination) of ownership interests in the Guarantor (directly or through a parent company) such that
the Guarantor does not remain a Restricted Subsidiary or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all
the assets of the Guarantor (other than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary), in each case, otherwise
permitted by the Indenture;

   - except for the Parent Guarantees, in connection with any sale or other disposition of Capital Stock of that
Guarantor (or Capital Stock of any Parent of such Guarantor (other than the Company and eircom Limited
(Jersey))) to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Company or
a Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale or other disposition does not violate the “Asset sale” provisions of the
Indenture and the Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of the sale or other
disposition;

   - except for the Parent Guarantees, if the Company designates any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor
to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

   - in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement;

   - upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as provided
below under the captions “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

   - upon the full and final payment of the Notes and performance of all Obligations of the Issuer and the
Guarantors under the Indenture and the Notes;

   - in the case only of the Parent Guarantees, pursuant to the provisions described below under “—IPO
_Pushdown”;_

   - as described under the caption “—Amendment and Waivers”;

   - except for the Parent Guarantees, to the extent that such Guarantor is unconditionally released and
discharged from its liability with respect to the Senior Facilities Agreement;

   - in connection with a Permitted Reorganization;

   - as a result of a transaction that would not be prohibited under “Certain Covenants—Merger and
_Consolidation”; or_

   - except for the Parent Guarantees, in connection with a solvent liquidation of such Guarantor pursuant to
which substantially all of the assets of such Guarantor remain owned by the Issuer or a Guarantor.

Substantially all the operations of the Company (and the Issuer) are conducted through its Subsidiaries.

Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors
holding debt and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if
any) of those Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries
over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including Holders of the Notes. The Notes and each
Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred and
minority stockholders of Subsidiaries of the Company (other than the Guarantors).

As of March 31, 2024, after giving effect to the issuance of the Notes and the use of proceeds therefrom, the

total liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries (excluding the Issuer) that will not guarantee the Notes were


-----

€810 million, consisting of drawings under FNI Facilities by Fibre Network Ireland Limited. Although the
Indenture limits the incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries,
the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture does not impose any
limitation on the incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Indebtedness.”_

**Security**

**_The Collateral_**

The Issuer shall take such necessary actions and shall cause its Restricted Subsidiaries to take such necessary

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of security in favor of obligations under the Senior

Facilities Agreement, the 2024 Notes, the 2026 Notes, the 2027 Notes and the Notes. The Agreed Security
Principles include restrictions on the granting of security where, among other things, such grant would be
restricted by corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference or “thin capitalization” laws or
regulations (or analogous restrictions), or where an action would result in a significant risk to the officers of the


-----

relevant grantor of security of contravention of their fiduciary duties and/or of civil and/or criminal liability, or
result in costs disproportionate to the benefit obtained by the beneficiaries of that security.

In addition, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and subject to the Agreed Security Principles, any and all

assets in which a security interest will be granted after the Issue Date pursuant to any Security Document to secure
the obligations under the Indenture, the Notes and/or any Notes Guarantee are, together with the Initial Collateral,
the “Collateral.” All Collateral shall be subject to the operation of the Agreed Security Principles and any
Permitted Collateral Liens. Counterparties to certain Hedging Agreements, and potentially future debt under super
senior revolving credit facilities, will receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral in priority to holders
of the Notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain assets will not be pledged (or the Liens not perfected) in
accordance with the Agreed Security Principles.

The Collateral secures the liabilities under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the 2024 Notes Indenture, the

2026 Notes Indenture, the 2027 Notes Indenture and certain Hedging Agreements and will secure the liabilities
under the Notes and any Additional Notes. Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, any Super Senior RCF or
any Hedging Obligations permitted to be incurred under the covenant “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Indebtedness” will be permitted to be secured on the Collateral on a super priority basis, and will receive priority_
over the Holders with respect to any proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any Collateral. Subject
to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Impairment of Security Interest,” the Company is permitted to grant security over the Collateral in connection_
with future issuances of its Indebtedness or Indebtedness of its Restricted Subsidiaries, including any Additional
Notes, in each case, as permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Administration of Security and Enforcement of Liens_**

The Security Documents and the Collateral will be administered by the Security Agent, in each case pursuant

to the Intercreditor Agreement for the benefit of all holders of secured obligations. The enforcement of the
Security Documents will be subject to the procedures set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement. For a description
of the Intercreditor Agreement, see “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.”

The ability of holders of the Notes to realize upon the Collateral will be subject to various bankruptcy law

limitations in the event of the Issuer’s or a Guarantor’s bankruptcy. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our
_Structure—The insolvency laws of Ireland or the jurisdiction of incorporation or formation of each of the_
_Guarantors may not be as favorable to holders of Notes as U.S. insolvency laws or those of another jurisdiction_
_with which you may be familiar.” In addition, the enforcement of the Collateral will be limited to the maximum_
amount required under the Agreed Security Principles to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and
other laws. As a result of these limitations, the enforceable amounts of the Issuer’s obligation under the Notes
and a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less than the total amounts payable with
respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee.

Subject to the terms of the Security Documents, the Issuer and the Guarantors will have the right to remain

in possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the Notes (other than as set forth in the
Security Documents), to freely operate the Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom.

No appraisals of any of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Issuer in connection with the

issuance of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the proceeds from the sale of the Collateral would be
sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the holders of the Notes, the obligations owed to the holders of the
2024 Notes, the 2026 Notes, the 2027 Notes, the payment of obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement
and any Hedging Obligations. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily
ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral can be sold in a short period
of time or at all.

In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement places limitations on the ability of the Security Agent to cause the

sale of some of the Collateral. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.”

The Indenture will provide that by accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed to have:

   - irrevocably appointed Wilmington Trust (London) Limited, as Security Agent to act as its agent under
the Intercreditor Agreement and the other relevant documents to which it is a party (including, without
limitation, the Security Documents);


-----

   - irrevocably authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and
discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement or other documents to which
it is a party (including, without limitation, the Security Documents), together with any other incidental
rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute each document, waiver, modification, amendment,
renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Security Agent on its behalf; and

   - accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement (as defined below) and each Holder will also be deemed to have authorized the Trustee to
enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Priority_**

The relative priority with regard to the Collateral, as between (a) the lenders under the Senior Facilities

Agreement, (b) the counterparties under certain Hedging Agreements, (c) the trustee and the holders under the
2024 Notes Indenture, (d) the trustee and holders under the 2026 Notes Indenture, (e) the trustee and holders under
the 2027 Notes Indenture, and (f) the Trustee and the Holders under the Indenture, is established by the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, which provide that the obligations under the Notes will
receive proceeds or enforcement of security over the Collateral only after certain Hedging Obligations are
satisfied. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.” In addition, pursuant to the
Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into after the Issue Date, the Collateral
may be pledged to secure other Indebtedness. See “—Security— Release of Liens,” “—Certain Covenants—
_Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens.”_

**_Release of Liens_**

Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, upon receipt of an Officer’s Certificate and opinion of

counsel, the Security Agent shall release, and the Trustee shall, if so requested, direct the Security Agent to release,
without the need for consent of the Holders, Liens over the property and other assets constituting Collateral
securing the Notes and the Guarantees:

(1) in connection with any disposition of Collateral, directly or indirectly, (a) to any Person other than

the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries if such disposition is not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture
(with respect to the Lien on such Collateral), (b) to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (i) consistent with
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (ii) if permitted by the Senior Facilities
Agreement, or (iii) if the relevant property and assets remain subject to, or otherwise become subject to, a Lien in
favor of the Notes following such transfer, sale or disposal, or (c) pursuant to any Permitted Property Transaction;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee (with respect to the Liens securing such

Guarantee granted by such Guarantor) in accordance with the Indenture;

(3) if the Company designates any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (other than the Issuer or eircom Limited

(Jersey)) to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release
of the property, assets and Capital Stock of such Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as

provided below under the captions “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

(5) upon the full and final payment of the Notes and performance of all obligations of the Issuer and the

Guarantors under the Indenture and the Notes;

(6) as described under the caption “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(7) as described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest”;

(8) in connection with an IPO Pushdown, as specified in the Indenture;

(9) automatically without any action by the Trustee, if the Lien granted in favor of the Senior Facilities

Agreement, Public Debt or such other Indebtedness that gave rise to the obligation to grant the Lien over such
Collateral is released (other than pursuant to the repayment and discharge thereof); or


-----

(10) as otherwise provided in the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

Each of these releases will be effected by the Security Agent and the Trustee without the consent of the

Holders. The Indenture will provide that any release of a Lien on Collateral will be evidenced by the delivery by
the Issuer to the Trustee of an Officer’s Certificate.

The Company, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may also, among other things, without any release

or consent by the Trustee or the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to Collateral,
including, without limitation, (i) selling or otherwise disposing of, in any transaction or series of related
transactions, any property subject to the Lien under the Security Documents which has become worn out, defective
or obsolete or not used or useful in the business; (ii) selling, transferring or otherwise disposing of current assets
in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice; and (iii) any other action permitted by the
Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_IPO Pushdown_**

(a) On, in contemplation of, or following an IPO Event, the Company shall be entitled to require (by

written notice to the Trustee (a “Pushdown Notice”)) that the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement shall operate (with effect from the date specified in the relevant Pushdown Notice (the “Pushdown
Date”)) on the basis that: (i) references to the Company and Restricted Subsidiaries (and all related provisions)
shall apply only to the IPO Entity and its Restricted Subsidiaries from time to time, although the Issuer shall
remain the same entity and the pledge of the shares of the Issuer and eircom Limited (Jersey) shall remain in place;
(ii) all financial ratio, basket calculations and financial definitions shall exclude any Holding Company of the IPO
Entity and all reporting obligations shall be assumed at the level of the IPO Entity; (iii) each reference in the
Indenture and/or the Intercreditor Agreement to the “Company” shall be deemed to be a reference to the IPO
Entity (to the extent applicable and unless the context requires otherwise); and nothing in this paragraph (a),
including the deeming construct contemplated by this sub-paragraph (iii) or any action taken by the IPO Entity
prior to it being deemed to be the Company, shall, or shall be deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute or result
in a breach of any covenant or other term in the Indenture or a Default or an Event of Default; (iv) none of the
representations, warranties, undertakings, covenants or Events of Default in the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement or the Collateral Documents shall apply to any Holding Company of the IPO Entity (whether in its
capacity as a Guarantor or otherwise); (v) no event, matter or circumstance relating to any Holding Company of
the IPO Entity (whether in its capacity as a Guarantor or otherwise) shall, or shall be deemed to, directly or
indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any covenant or other term in the Indenture or a Default or an Event
of Default; (vi) each Holding Company of the IPO Entity shall be irrevocably and unconditionally released from
all obligations under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any security granted by any such Holding
Company; and (vii) unless otherwise notified by the Company: (A) each person which is party to the Intercreditor
Agreement as a “Subordinated Creditor” shall be irrevocably and unconditionally released from the Intercreditor
Agreement and all obligations and restrictions under the Intercreditor Agreement (and from the date specified by
the Company that Person shall cease to be party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Subordinated Creditor and
shall have no further rights or obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement as a Subordinated Creditor); and
(B) there shall be no obligation or requirement for any Person to become party to the Intercreditor Agreement as
a Subordinated Creditor; and (viii) in the event that any Person is released from or does not become party to the
Intercreditor Agreement as a Subordinated Creditor as a consequence of this paragraph (a), any term of the
Indenture and/or the Intercreditor Agreement which requires or assumes that any Person be a Subordinated
Creditor or that any liabilities or obligations to such Person be subject to the Intercreditor Agreement or otherwise
subordinated shall cease to apply. An IPO Pushdown Notice may not be delivered if a Default or Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing (disregarding any Default or Event of Default that could be deemed to arise in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this provision).

(b) The Trustee and the Security Agent shall be required to enter into any amendment to the Indenture

or amendment to or replacement of the Intercreditor Agreement or the Collateral Documents required by the
Company in writing and/or take such other action as is required by the Company in order to facilitate or reflect
any of the matters contemplated by paragraph (a) above, provided that such amendment, replacement or other
document or instrument does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent or, in the
opinion of the Trustee or the Security Agent, does not affect the rights, duties, liabilities, indemnifications or
immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent and or such amendment, replacement or other document or
instrument. The Trustee and the Security Agent are each irrevocably authorized and instructed by the Holders of
the Notes (without any consent by the Holders of the Notes) to execute any such amended or replacement


-----

documents and/or take other such action on behalf of the Holders (and shall do so on the request of and at the cost
of the Company).

(c) For the purpose of this covenant, the “IPO Entity” shall be the Company or any Restricted

Subsidiary of the Company notified to the Trustee by the Company in writing as the Person to be treated as the
IPO Entity in relation to the relevant IPO Event; provided that: (i) the IPO Entity shall be a Restricted Subsidiary
which will issue shares, or whose shares are to be sold, pursuant to that IPO Event (or a Holding Company of such
member of the Group); and (ii) the Company may not designate a Subsidiary of eircom Limited (Jersey) as the
IPO Entity.

(d) If the Company delivers a Pushdown Notice to the Trustee pursuant to paragraph (a) above in

relation to a contemplated IPO Event, it shall be entitled to revoke that Pushdown Notice at any time prior to the
occurrence of the relevant IPO Event by written notice to the Trustee. In the event that any Pushdown Notice is
revoked in accordance with this paragraph (d): (i) the provisions of sub-paragraphs (a)(i) to (a)(vii) above shall
cease to apply in relation to that Pushdown Notice; (ii) if any security has been released pursuant to paragraph (a)
above in reliance on that Pushdown Notice, if required by the Trustee by prior written notice to the Company and
subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary shall as soon as
reasonably practicable execute a replacement Collateral Document in respect of that security; and (iii) if any
Person party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a “Subordinated Creditor” has been released from the Intercreditor
Agreement pursuant to sub-paragraph (a)(vii) above in reliance on that Pushdown Notice, if required by the
Trustee by prior written notice to the Company and that Person, that Person shall as soon as reasonably practicable
accede to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Subordinated Creditor.

For the avoidance of doubt: (A) nothing in paragraph (d) above shall prohibit or otherwise restrict the Company
from delivering a further Pushdown Notice in relation to any actual or contemplated IPO Event; and
(B) revocation of a Pushdown Notice shall not, and shall not be deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute or
result in a breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking or other term in the Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement or a Default or an Event of Default (whether by reason of any action or step taken by any Person, or
any matter or circumstance arising or committed, while that Pushdown Notice was effective or otherwise).

**Amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement and Additional Intercreditor Agreements**

In connection with the Incurrence of any Indebtedness by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries

that is permitted to share in the Collateral (and which the Company elects will share in the Collateral), the Trustee
and the Security Agent shall, at the request of the Company, enter into with the Company, the relevant Restricted
Subsidiaries and the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized representatives) one or more
intercreditor agreements or deeds (including a restatement, replacement, amendment or other modification of the
Intercreditor Agreement) (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”), on substantially the same terms as the
Intercreditor Agreement (or terms that are not materially less favorable to the Holders) and substantially similar
as applies to sharing of the proceeds of security and enforcement of security, priority and release of security;
_provided that any Additional Intercreditor Agreement may give super priority ranking to any obligations under a_
Super Senior RCF and Hedging Obligations; provided, further, that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will
not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or adversely affect the personal rights,
duties, liabilities, indemnification or immunities of the Trustee or the Security Agent under the Indenture or the
Intercreditor Agreement. In connection with the foregoing, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee and the
Security Agent such documentation in relation thereto as it may reasonably require. As used herein, a reference
to the Intercreditor Agreement will also include any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

In relation to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee shall consent on behalf of the holders to the payment,

repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations
subordinated to the Notes thereby; _provided, however, that such transaction would comply with the covenant_
described herein under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

The Indenture will also provide that, at the written direction of the Issuer and without the consent of Holders,

the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor
Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the
amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such Intercreditor Agreement that may be Incurred by the
Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries that is subject to any such Intercreditor Agreement (provided that such
Indebtedness is Incurred in compliance with the Indenture), (3) add Guarantors or other Restricted Subsidiaries to
the Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes), (5) make provision for


-----

equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Notes or to implement any Permitted Collateral
Liens or to implement a pushdown in relation to an IPO Event in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, or
(6) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders of Notes in any
material respect. The Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or Security Agent to enter into any amendment
to any Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of
the Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under “—Amendments and Waivers” or as
permitted by the terms of such Intercreditor Agreement, and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee or Security
Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on
the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect their respective
rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under the Indenture or any Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and

accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement (whether then entered into or entered into in the
future pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have authorized the Trustee and the Security Agent to
enter into the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement on each Holder’s behalf.

A copy of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement shall be made available to

the Holders upon request and will be made available for inspection during normal business hours on any Business
Day upon prior written request at the office of the Issuer and, for so long as any Notes are listed on the Official
List of The International Stock Exchange, at the offices of the Listing Agent in the Channel Islands.

**Notes Proceeds Loan**

On or following the issuance of the Notes, the Issuer, as lender, and eircom Limited (Jersey), as borrower,

will enter into a notes proceeds loan agreement, pursuant to which the Issuer will lend the proceeds from the
issuance of the Notes to eircom Limited (Jersey) (the “Notes Proceeds Loan Agreement”)

**Optional Redemption**

**_Optional Redemption of the Notes_**

Except as set forth herein and under “—Redemption for Taxation Reasons,” the Notes are not redeemable at

the option of the Issuer.

At any time prior to      , 2026, the Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole or in part, at its option, upon

not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount
of such Notes _plus the relevant Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional_
Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date.

At any time and from time to time on or after      , 2026, the Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole or in

part, at a redemption price equal to the percentage of principal amount set forth below plus accrued and unpaid
interest to, but not including, the redemption date:

**Twelve month period commencing           in** **Percentage**

2026 ........................................................................................................................... %

2027 ............................................................................................................................ %

2028 and thereafter .................................................................................................... 100.000%

At any time and from time to time prior to      , 2026, the Issuer may redeem the Notes with the net cash

proceeds received by the Issuer from any Equity Offering at a redemption price equal to        % plus accrued
and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date, in an aggregate principal amount for all such
redemptions not to exceed 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes (excluding any Additional
Notes with terms and conditions that are not identical to the terms and conditions of the Notes), provided that:

(1) in each case the redemption takes place not later than 180 days after the closing of the related Equity

Offering; and

(2) not less than 50% of the original principal amount of the Notes being redeemed (excluding any

principal amount of any Additional Notes with terms and conditions that are not identical to the terms and
conditions of the Notes) remain outstanding immediately thereafter.


-----

Notice of any redemption upon any Equity Offering may be given prior to the completion thereof.

**_General_**

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Notes, including a Change of

Control Offer or Asset Disposition Offer, if Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the
applicable outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer,
or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and
not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more
than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase date, to redeem all Notes that
remain outstanding following such purchase at a price equal to the price paid to each other Holder in such tender
offer (other than any early tender or incentive payment), _plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer_
payment, accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon, to, but not including, the
redemption date. In determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the
then outstanding Notes have validly tendered and not withdrawn Notes in a tender offer or other offer to purchase
for all of the Notes, as applicable, Notes owned by an affiliate of the Issuer or by funds controlled or managed by
any affiliate of the Issuer, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such
tender offer or other offer, as applicable.

Any redemption and notice of redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one

or more conditions precedent (including, in the case of a redemption related to an Equity Offering, the
consummation of such Equity Offering). In addition, if such redemption or notice is subject to satisfaction of one
or more conditions precedent, such notice may state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be
delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied or waived by the Issuer (provided, however,
that, in any case, such redemption date shall be no more than 60 days from the date on which such notice is first
given), or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded (no later than the business day prior
to such redemption date) in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied or waived by the
Issuer by the redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed. Notwithstanding anything else in the
Indenture or the Notes to the contrary, redemption notices may be mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption
date if the notice is issued in connection with the defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the
Indenture. In addition, the Issuer may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and
performance of the Issuer’s obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person.

If requested in writing by the Issuer to the Trustee and the Paying Agent (which request may be included in

an Officer’s Certificate), the Paying Agent will distribute any amounts deposited to the Holders prior to the
redemption date; provided that the Holders shall have received at least five Business Days’ notice from the Issuer
of such earlier repayment date (which may be included in the notice of redemption). For the avoidance of doubt,
the distribution and payment to Holders prior to the redemption date as set forth above will not include any
negative interest, present value adjustments, break costs or any other premium on such amounts. To the extent
the Notes are represented by a global note deposited with a clearing system, any payment to the beneficial holders
holding interests as a participant of such clearing system will be subject to the then applicable procedures of the
clearing system. No Trustee, Paying Agent or other applicable party shall be required to incur any costs, fees or
expenses (except as expressly agreed in writing) in relation to such distribution.

If the Issuer effects an optional redemption of the Notes, it will, for so long as the Notes are listed on the

Official List of The International Stock Exchange and rules of The International Stock Exchange Limited so
require, inform The International Stock Exchange of such optional redemption and confirm the aggregate principal
amount of the Notes that will remain outstanding immediately after such redemption.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest

payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is registered at
the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will
be subject to redemption by the Issuer.

The Issuer or its Affiliates may at any time and from time to time purchase Notes. Any such purchases may

be made through open market or privately negotiated transactions with third parties or pursuant to one or more
tender or exchange offers or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as well as with such consideration as
the Issuer or any such Affiliate may determine. Subject to any applicable limitations contained in the agreements
governing our indebtedness, including the Senior Facilities Agreement, the 2024 Notes Indenture, the 2026 Notes
Indenture, the 2027 Notes Indenture, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor


-----

Agreement, any purchases made by the Issuer or the Company may be funded by the use of cash on our balance
sheet or the incurrence of new secured or unsecured debt, including borrowings under our credit facilities. The
amounts involved in any such purchase transaction, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. Any such
purchases may be with respect to a substantial amount of a particular class or series of debt, with the attendant
reduction in the trading liquidity of such class or series.

**Sinking Fund**

The Issuer will not be required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with

respect to the Notes.

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent or the Registrar, as applicable,

will select the Notes for redemption in compliance with the requirements of the principal securities exchange, if
any, on which the Notes are listed, as certified to the Paying Agent or the Registrar, as applicable, by the Issuer,
and in compliance with the requirements of Euroclear or Clearstream, or if the Notes are not so listed or such
exchange prescribes no method of selection and the Notes are not held through Euroclear or Clearstream or
Euroclear or Clearstream prescribe no method of selection, on a pro rata basis or by use of a pool factor; provided,
_however,_ that no Note of €100,000 in aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part and only Notes
in integral multiples of €1,000 will be redeemed. Neither the Trustee, the Paying Agent nor the Registrar will be
liable for any selections made in accordance with this paragraph.

So long as any Notes are listed on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange and the rules of The

International Stock Exchange so require, any such notice to the Holders of the Notes shall, to the extent and in the
manner permitted by such rules, be posted on the official website of The International Stock Exchange
(www.tisegroup.com/) and, in addition to such release, not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days prior to the
redemption date, the Issuer will mail, or at the expense of the Issuer, cause to be mailed, such notice to Holders
by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at their respective addresses as they appear on the registration books of the
Registrar.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state the

portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, in which case a portion of the original Note will be issued
in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note. In the case of a Global Note, an
appropriate notation will be made on such Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to
the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice (including any
conditions contained therein), Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and
after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of them called for redemption.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer or Successor Issuer, as defined below, may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time

upon giving not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice to the Holders of the Notes (which notice will be
irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the outstanding principal amount thereof, together with
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”)
(subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date) and all Additional Amounts (see “—Withholding Taxes”), if any, then due and which will become
due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if any, if the Issuer, Successor Issuer
or Guarantor determine in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated

thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or

(2) any change in, or amendment to, or the introduction of, an official position regarding the application,

administration or interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including a holding, judgment or
order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in official published practice) of a Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction (each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

the Issuer, Successor Issuer or Guarantor are, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Notes would
be, required to pay any Additional Amounts, and the Issuer determines in good faith that such obligation cannot


-----

be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Issuer, Successor Issuer or Guarantor (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable and would not
cause the Issuer to incur additional out-of-pocket costs, but not including assignment or novation of the
obligation to make payment with respect to the Notes). In the case of redemption due to withholding as a result
of a Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction that is a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction at the date of the Offering
Memorandum, such Change in Tax Law must become effective on or after the date of the Offering
Memorandum. In the case of redemption due to withholding as a result of a Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction
that becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction after the date of the Offering Memorandum, such Change in Tax
Law must become effective on or after the date the jurisdiction becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, unless
the Change in Tax Law would have applied to the predecessor of the Successor Issuer. Notice of redemption for
taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under “—Selection and Notice.”
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier than 90 days prior to the
earliest date on which the Payor (as defined below) would be obliged to make such payment of Additional
Amounts if a payment in respect of the Notes were then due and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, such
obligation to pay such Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice
of redemption of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer or Successor Issuer will deliver to the Trustee
(i) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of
facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to redeem have been satisfied and that it would not be
able to avoid the obligation to pay Additional Amounts by taking reasonable measures available to it and (ii) an
opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing to the effect that the Issuer, Successor Issuer or
Guarantor has or have been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax
Law. The Trustee will accept such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of
the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and
binding on the Holders.

The foregoing will apply _mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to the Issuer is_

incorporated or resident for tax purposes or organized or has a permanent establishment or any political
subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by the Issuer, a Successor Issuer or Guarantor (a “Payor”) on the Notes or the Guarantees,

as defined below, will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any
Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding
for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) Ireland or any political subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof or therein having power to

tax;

(2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note or Guarantee is made by the

Issuer, Successor Issuer, Guarantor or their agents, or any political subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof
or therein having the power to tax; or

(3) any other jurisdiction in which the Payor is incorporated or organized, resident for tax purposes, or

any political subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of
clauses (1), (2) and (3), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”),

will at any time be required from any payments made by a Payor with respect to any Note or Guarantee,

including payments of principal, redemption price, premium, if any, or interest, the Payor will pay (together with
such payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net
amounts received in respect of such payments by the Holders or the Trustee, as the case may be, after such
withholding or deduction (including any such deduction or withholding from such Additional Amounts), will
equal the amounts which would have been received in respect of such payments on any such Note or Guarantee
in the absence of such withholding or deduction; _provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be_
payable for or on account of:

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former

connection between the relevant Holder or the beneficial owner of a Note (or between a fiduciary, settlor,
beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder or beneficial owner, if the
relevant Holder or beneficial owner is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or


-----

corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including but not limited to being a citizen or resident or
national or domiciliary of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in or a dependent
agent in, or being physically present in, or having a place of management present or deemed present in, the
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition,
ownership or holding of such Note or the receipt of any payment in respect thereof;

(2) any Taxes that are imposed, deducted or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the

beneficial owner of the Note to comply with any reasonable request of the Payor to provide certification,
information, documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence, identity of or connection with the
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction of the Holder or such beneficial owner (or of or between a fiduciary, settlor,
beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder or beneficial owner, if the
relevant Holder or beneficial owner is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or
corporation) or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any certification, information, documentation
or other reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by applicable law, treaty, regulation or
administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or part of such
Taxes;

(3) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment on or with

respect to the Notes or any Guarantee;

(4) any estate, inheritance, gift, value, use, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

(5) any Taxes imposed in connection with a Note presented for payment (where presentation is

permitted or required for payment) by or on behalf of a Holder or beneficial owner who would have been able to
avoid such Tax by presenting the relevant Note to, or otherwise accepting payment from, another paying agent;

(6) any Taxes which would not have been imposed if the Holder had presented the Note for payment

(where presentation is permitted or required for payment) within 30 days after the relevant payment was first made
available for payment to the Holder (except for Additional Amounts with respect to Taxes that would have been
imposed had the Holder presented the Note for payment within such 30-day period);

(7) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to a payment to a Holder that is a fiduciary or partnership

(including an entity that is treated as a partnership for applicable tax purposes) or any Person other than the sole
beneficial owner of such payment or Note, to the extent that a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary,
a member of such partnership or entity treated as a partnership for applicable tax purposes or the beneficial owner
of such payment or Note would not have been entitled to the Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor,
member or beneficial owner been the actual Holder of such Note;

(8) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to a Note pursuant to Sections 1471 to 1474 of the Code, any

successor law or regulation implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such Sections
or any intergovernmental agreement or any agreement entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b)(1) of the Code;
or

(9) any combination of items (1) through (8) above.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or

withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction to the extent required by applicable law. The Payor will use
reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or
withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, in such form as provided in the ordinary
course by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and as is reasonably available to the Issuer and will provide such
certified copies to the Trustee. Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon request and will be made
available at the offices of the Listing Agent in the Channel Islands if the Notes are then listed on the Official List
of The International Stock Exchange.

If any Payor becomes obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on

any Note or Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee
and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the
amount so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts
to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less
than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as


-----

promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date). The Trustee and the Paying Agent
will be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

Wherever in either the Indenture, the Guarantees or this “Description of the Notes” there are mentioned, in

any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts as described under this heading to
the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay any present or future stamp, court or documentary taxes, or any other property or similar

taxes, charges or levies that arise in any jurisdiction from the execution, delivery, registration or enforcement of
any Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents or any other document or
instrument in relation thereto (other than a transfer or exchange of the Notes) excluding any such taxes, charges
or levies imposed by any jurisdiction that is not a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, and the Payor agrees to indemnify
the Holders for any such taxes paid by such Holders. The foregoing obligations of this paragraph will survive any
termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which
any successor to the Issuer is organized or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Change of Control**

If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms hereof, each Holder will have the right to require the Issuer

to repurchase all or part (equal to €100,000 aggregate principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess
thereof), as the case may be, of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal
amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of
record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided, however,
that the Issuer shall not be obliged to repurchase Notes as described under this “—Change of Control” section in
the event and to the extent that it has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all of the Notes as described
under “—Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived.

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes as described under “—

_Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the date_
that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Issuer will mail a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) to each
Holder of any such Notes, with a copy to the Trustee:

(1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to

require the Issuer to purchase such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal
amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the
right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change
of Control Payment”);

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the

date such notice is mailed) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that

constitute the Change of Control;

(4) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder must

follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and

(5) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of

Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control.


-----

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the

extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all

Notes so tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal

amount of Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer;

(4) in the case of a Global Note, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying Agent the Global Note

in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased
by the Issuer; and

(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar

for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer.

If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the relevant Paying Agent will promptly mail to each

Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee
will promptly authenticate (or cause to be authenticated) and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to
each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Note equal in aggregate principal amount to the unpurchased
portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; _provided that each such new Note will be in an aggregate principal_
amount that is at least €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange and the

rules of The International Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish notices relating to the Change of
Control Offer as soon as reasonably practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date, to the extent and in
the manner permitted by such rules, on the official website of The International Stock Exchange
(www.tisegroup.com/).

The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of

the Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does
not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the
event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Issuer
to repurchase such Holder’s Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from
seeking to acquire the Company or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party

makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements
set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes
validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer.

If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do

not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third-party making a Change of
Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third-party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more
than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control
Offer described above, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash
equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the notes that
remain outstanding to, but not including, the date of redemption (subject to the right of Holders of record on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date that is on or prior to the redemption date).
In determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding
Notes have validly tendered and not withdrawn Notes in a tender offer or other offer to purchase for all of the
Notes, as applicable, Notes owned by an affiliate of the Issuer or by funds controlled or managed by any affiliate
of the Issuer, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer or
other offer, as applicable.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations (or exchange rules) conflict with

provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations (or exchange


-----

rules) and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations, or require a repurchase of the Notes, under the
Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of the conflict. The Issuer may rely on any no-action
letters issued by the SEC indication that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event
a tender offer satisfies certain conditions.

Under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the occurrence of a change of control would require the repayment of

such debt. Future debt of the Company or its Subsidiaries may prohibit the Issuer from purchasing Notes in the
event of a Change of Control or provide that a Change of Control is a default or requires repurchase upon a Change
of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to purchase the Notes could
cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, other debt, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to
the financial effect of the purchase on the Issuer.

Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may

be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will
be available when necessary to make the required purchase of the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to
_Our Structure—We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the_
_Notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control as required by each Indenture and_
_the change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event_
_of certain important corporate events.”_

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and

assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there
is limited case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase
“substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of
uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the
property or assets of a Person. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and
whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as

a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in
outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes under the Indenture.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness

(including Acquired Indebtedness); provided, however, that the Company and any of the Restricted Subsidiaries
may Incur Indebtedness if on the date of such Incurrence and after giving pro forma effect thereto (including pro
forma application of the proceeds thereof), the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio of the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries is less than 5.0 to 1.0.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness:

(1) Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect

thereof in a maximum aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not exceeding (a)(i) €1,950.0 million

(3) Indebtedness of the Company owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a

Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that


-----

(i) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which results in any such Indebtedness
being beneficially held by a Person other than the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company; and
(ii) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person other than the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Company, shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such Indebtedness by
the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be;

(4) Indebtedness represented by (a) the Notes and the proceeds loan in respect thereof (other than any

Additional Notes and any Additional Notes Proceeds Loan), (b) any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness

outstanding not exceeding the principal amount of the 2024 Notes as of the date hereof, (d) Refinancing

(e) Management Advances;

(5) Indebtedness of any Person (i) Incurred and outstanding on the date on which such Person becomes

a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary of the Company or is merged,
consolidated, amalgamated or otherwise combined with (including pursuant to any acquisition of assets and
assumption of related liabilities) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or (ii) Incurred to provide all or any
portion of the funds utilized to consummate the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such
Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was otherwise acquired by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary;
_provided, however, that Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clauses (5)(i) and (5)(ii), in an aggregate amount, will_
not exceed (A) the greater of €160 million and 25% of Consolidated EBITDA, plus (B) unlimited Indebtedness
to the extent that at the time of such acquisition or other transaction (I) the Company would have been able to
Incur €1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant after giving _pro forma_
effect to the relevant acquisition and the Incurrence of such Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (5) or (II) the
Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries would not be greater than it was
immediately prior to giving effect to such acquisition or other transaction;

EBITDA and (ii) Permitted Vendor Financing;

(8) Indebtedness in respect of (a) workers’ compensation claims, self-insurance obligations,

guarantees Incurred in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice (including, without
limitation, for asset rentals and/or purchases of goods or services) or in respect of any governmental requirement,

consistent with past practice, (b) letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances, guarantees or other similar instruments or
obligations issued or relating to liabilities or obligations Incurred in the ordinary course of business or consistent
with past practice or in respect of any governmental requirement, including in relation to a governmental
requirement to provide a letter of credit, guarantee or similar obligation for any spectrum acquisition; _provided,_
_however, that upon the drawing of such letters of credit or similar instruments, the obligations are reimbursed_
within 30 Business Days following such drawing, (c) the financing of insurance premiums in the ordinary course
of business or consistent with past practice, and (d) any customary cash management, cash pooling or netting or

or any Capital Stock of a Subsidiary (other than Guarantees of Indebtedness Incurred by any Person acquiring or


-----

disposing of such business or assets or such Subsidiary for the purpose of financing such acquisition or
disposition); provided that the maximum liability of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in respect of all
such Indebtedness related to a disposition will at no time exceed the gross proceeds, including the fair market
value of non-cash proceeds (measured at the time received and without giving effect to any subsequent changes
in value), actually received by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with such disposition;

(10) (a) Indebtedness arising from the honoring by a bank or other financial institution of a check,

covenant described below under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” to the extent the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries incur Indebtedness in reliance thereon and (ii) any Net Cash Proceeds that are so received
or contributed shall be excluded for purposes of Incurring Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (12) to the extent
the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries makes a Restricted Payment under the first paragraph and
clauses (1), (6) and (10) of the third paragraph of the covenant described below under “—Limitation on Restricted

of any equipment necessary to perform services for such customer; _provided that (A) the repayment of such_
Indebtedness is conditional upon such customer ordering a specific volume of goods and (B) such Indebtedness
does not bear interest or provide for scheduled amortization or maturity.

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular

Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness

described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Company, in its sole discretion, will classify,
and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount and
type of such Indebtedness in one of the clauses of the second paragraph or the first paragraph of this covenant;

(2) all Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date under the Senior Facilities Agreement and under the

FNI Facilities Agreement shall be deemed initially Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of the
description of this covenant and not the first paragraph or clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the description
of this covenant, provided that such Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) may be reclassified by the Company in
any manner that complies with this covenant;

(3) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar

instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of a
particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are

Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1), (7), (11) or (12) of
the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other
similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;

(5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, or

Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or
repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation
preference thereof;

(6) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision

permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other
provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(7) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be

equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS;

(8) for the purposes of determining “Consolidated EBITDA” under this covenant, Consolidated

EBITDA will be measured for the period of the four most recent consecutive fiscal quarters ending prior to such
date for which internal consolidated financial statements of the Company are available; and for purpose of any
calculation under this covenant, Indebtedness shall be measured at the option of the Company on the most recent
date on which new commitments are obtained or the date upon which Indebtedness is incurred (in the case of
revolving facilities);

(9) with respect to Indebtedness Incurred under a Credit Facility or Operating Facility, re-borrowings

of amounts previously repaid pursuant to a “cash sweep” or “clean down” provisions or any similar provisions


-----

under a Credit Facility or Operating Facility that provide that Indebtedness is deemed to have been repaid
periodically will only be deemed for the purposes of the covenant described under this “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness” to have been Incurred on the date such Indebtedness was first Incurred and not on the date of any_
subsequent re-borrowing thereof;

(10) notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in the case of any Refinancing Indebtedness, when

measuring the outstanding amount of such Indebtedness, such amount shall not include any amounts necessary to
pay accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and expenses, including any premium and defeasance costs,
indemnity fees, discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such refinancing;

(11) in the event that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments under

a revolving credit facility, enters into any commitment to Incur or issue Indebtedness or commits to Incur any
Lien pursuant to paragraph (25) of the definition of “Permitted Liens,” the Incurrence or issuance thereof for all
purposes under the Indenture, including without limitation for purposes of calculating the Consolidated Secured
Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, or borrowings and re-borrowings under
any of clauses (1) through (18) (inclusive) of the second paragraph of the description of this covenant (and
including issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will, at the Company’s
option, either: (A) be determined on the date of such revolving credit facility or such entry into or increase in
commitments (assuming that the full amount thereof has been borrowed as of such date) or other Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, and, if the Consolidated Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated
Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, test or other provision of the Indenture is satisfied with respect thereto at such
time, any borrowing or re-borrowing thereunder (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’
acceptances thereunder) will be permitted under the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness”
irrespective of the Consolidated Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, as
applicable, test or other provision of the Indenture at the time of any borrowing or re-borrowing (or issuance or
creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) (the committed amount permitted to be borrowed
or reborrowed (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances) on a date pursuant to
the operation of this sub-paragraph (A) shall be deemed to be Incurred and outstanding under such paragraph(s));
or (B) be determined on the date such amount is borrowed pursuant to any such facility or increased commitment;
_provided that the Company may revoke such determination made pursuant to this paragraph (10) at any time and_
from time to time; and

(12) in the case of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on

any provision of the second paragraph of the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness”
measured by reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA at the time of Incurrence, if such refinancing
would cause the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated based on the
percentage of Consolidated EBITDA on the date of such refinancing, such percentage of Consolidated EBITDA
restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness
does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, _plus premiums (including tender_
premiums), defeasance costs, indemnity fees, upfront fees, any required tax gross-up amounts and other costs,
fees and expenses in connection with such refinancing.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of

original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends
in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments
or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS, including a change of IFRS to U.S. GAAP,
will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “—
_Limitation on Indebtedness” (and in the case of Indebtedness that constitutes the payment of interest in the form_
of additional Indebtedness shall be permitted to be secured by a Lien to the same extent as the Indebtedness to
which the payment of interest relates). The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be
calculated as specified under the definition of “Indebtedness.”

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such

Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company as of such date.

For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of

Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another
currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness
was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or, at the option of the Company, first committed, in the case of
Indebtedness Incurred under a Senior Facilities Agreement; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to


-----

refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro, and such refinancing would cause the
applicable euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in
effect on the date of such refinancing, such non-euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been
exceeded so long as the aggregate principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the
aggregate principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus any amount to pay premiums (including
tender premiums), accrued and unpaid interest, expenses, defeasance costs and fees in connection therewith;
(b) the Euro Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date
shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if any such
Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to the
euro) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in
euro will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the

Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded
solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness
Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being
refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such
Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

or is permitted pursuant to the first paragraph above and/or one or more of the paragraphs contained in the


-----

definition of “Permitted Investments,” the Company will be entitled to classify such Restricted Payment or
Investment (or portion thereof) on the date of its payment or later reclassify (based on circumstances existing on
the date of such reclassification) such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) in any manner that
complies with this the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments,” including as an
Investment pursuant to one or more of the paragraphs contained in the definition of “Permitted Investments.”

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur

or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary
of the Company), whether owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any interest therein or any
income or profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the “Initial Lien”), except (a) in
the case of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral, (i) Permitted Liens or (ii) Liens on property
or assets that are not Permitted Liens if the Notes and the Indenture (or a Guarantee in the case of Liens of a
Guarantor) are directly secured equally and ratably with, or prior to, in the case of Liens with respect to
Subordinated Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so long as such Indebtedness is so
secured, and (b) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Notes pursuant to clause (a)(ii) of the preceding paragraph will be

automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to
which it relates and (ii) otherwise as set forth under “—Security—Release of Liens.”

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time of

the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount (as defined
below) of such Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount
of such Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization
of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms,
accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness
outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of property
securing Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or permit

to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any Restricted
Subsidiary to:

(1) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or pay any

Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Issuer;

(2) make any loans or advances to the Issuer; or

(3) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Issuer,

_provided that (a) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to_
dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (b) the subordination of (including the
application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to
constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the Senior Finance

Documents) or (b) any other agreement or instrument, in each case, in effect at or entered into on the Issue Date,
including the 2024 Notes Indenture, the 2026 Notes Indenture and the 2027 Notes Indenture;

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or relating to any

Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date on which such Person was acquired
by or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, or was
designated as a Restricted Subsidiary or on which such agreement or instrument is assumed by the Company or
any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of assets (other than Capital Stock or Indebtedness


-----

Incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to consummate, the transaction
or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by
the Company or was merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary entered into or in connection with such transaction) and outstanding on such date; provided that, for
the purposes of this clause (2), if another Person is the Successor Company, any Subsidiary thereof or agreement
or instrument of such Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or assumed by the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary when such Person becomes the Successor Company;

Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or instrument referred to in
clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3) (an “Initial Agreement”) or contained in any amendment,
supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this
clause (3); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary
contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less favorable in any material respect to the Holders taken
as a whole than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to
which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as determined in good faith by
the Company), or that the Company determines when such Indebtedness is Incurred that such encumbrances or
restrictions will not adversely affect, in any material respect, the Company’s ability to make principal or interest
payments on the Notes;

(4) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or

asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract, or the assignment or transfer of any lease, license or
other contract;

(b) contained in mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements permitted under the

Indenture or securing Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary permitted under the Indenture to
the extent such encumbrances or restrictions restrict the transfer of the property or assets subject to such
mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements;

(c) contained in any trading, netting, operating, construction, service, supply, purchase, sale or other

agreement to which the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is a party entered into in the ordinary course
of business or consistent with past practice; provided that such encumbrance relates solely to the property or assets
of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary that are the subject to such agreement, the payment rights arising
thereunder or the proceeds thereof and does not extend to any other asset or property of the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary or the assets or property of another Restricted Subsidiary; or

(d) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth in

any reciprocal easement agreements of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Capitalized Lease

the transfer of the assets of the joint venture;

(6) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary (or any of its property or

assets) imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or indirect sale or disposition to a Person of

(11) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument relating to any

Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” if the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such
agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Holders than (i) the
encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement,
together with the security documents associated therewith as in effect on the Issue Date, or (ii) in comparable
financings (as determined in good faith by the Company) or where the Company determines when such
Indebtedness is Incurred that such encumbrances or restrictions will not adversely affect, in any material respect,
the Company’s ability to make principal or interest payments on the Notes;

(12) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any lien permitted under “—Limitation on

_Liens”; or_

(13) restrictions effected in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing that, in the good faith

determination of the Board of Directors of the Company, are necessary or advisable to effect such Qualified
Receivables Financing.

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset Disposition

unless:

(1) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including

by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise)
at least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value to be determined on the date of contractually agreeing
to such Asset Disposition), as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company, of the shares
and assets subject to such Asset Disposition (including, for the avoidance of doubt, if such Asset Disposition is a
Permitted Asset Swap);

(2) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions (except to the extent the Asset

Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap), at least 75% of the consideration from such Asset Disposition (excluding
any consideration by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities,
contingent or otherwise, other than Indebtedness) received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the
case may be, is in the form of cash, Cash Equivalents or Temporary Cash Investments; and

(3) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied by the

Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be:

(a) to the extent the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, elects (or is required

by the terms of any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary), to (i) prepay, repay or purchase (A) any Indebtedness
of a non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiary (in each case, other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary) or (B) any Indebtedness that is secured by Liens on assets which do not constitute Collateral
(in each case other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor or Indebtedness owed to the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary); (ii) to prepay, repay or purchase Pari Passu Indebtedness at a price of no
more than 100% of the principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness plus accrued and unpaid interest to the
date of such prepayment, repayment or purchase, provided, however, that, in connection with any prepayment,
repayment or purchase of Indebtedness pursuant to clause (i) or (ii), the Company or such any Restricted
Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and will cause the related commitment (if any) (except in the case of any
revolving Indebtedness) to be permanently reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid
or purchased; (iii) to purchase the Notes through open-market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions at
market prices (which may be below par), or make an offer to all holders of Notes at a purchase price in cash equal
to at least 100% of the principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the
date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on
the relevant interest payment date), (iv) to redeem Notes as described under _“—Optional Redemption” or_
(v) purchase their Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth below for an Asset Disposition Offer (which
offer shall be deemed to be an Asset Disposition Offer for purposes thereof);


-----

(b) to the extent the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary elects, to (i) invest in or commit to

invest in Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional Assets by a Restricted Subsidiary
with Net Available Cash received by the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary) or (ii) make capital
expenditures, in each case, within 425 days from the later of (A) the date of such Asset Disposition and (B) the
receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however, that any such reinvestment in Additional Assets or capital
expenditure made pursuant to a definitive binding agreement or a commitment approved by the Board of Directors
of the Company that is executed or approved within such time will satisfy this requirement, so long as such
investment or capital expenditure is consummated within 180 days of such 425th day; or

(c) any combination of the foregoing,

_provided that, pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash in accordance with clause (a) or_
clause (b) above, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness or
otherwise invest such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that (1) a distribution of any or all of the Net Available Cash of

any Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary of the Company to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (to
the extent necessary to comply with this covenant) is prohibited or delayed by applicable local law or regulation
(including financial assistance and corporate benefit restrictions and fiduciary and statutory duties of the relevant
directors) or (2) a distribution of any or all of the Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary to
the Company, or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (to the extent necessary to comply with this covenant) could
result in material adverse tax consequences, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion, the portion of
such Net Available Cash so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant.

Any Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or committed to be applied

or invested as provided in the preceding paragraph will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds” under the
Indenture. On the 425th day (or the 606[th] day, as applicable) after an Asset Disposition, or at such earlier date
that the Company elects, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds under the Indenture exceeds the greater of
€96 million and 15% of Consolidated EBITDA in a single transaction, the Company will be required to make an
offer (“Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders of Notes issued under the Indenture and, to the extent the Company
elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum aggregate principal
amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be
purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the
case of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes
and 100% of the principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest,
if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or
the agreements governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, and in minimum denominations of
€100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

To the extent that the aggregate principal amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered

and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Company
may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to the other covenants contained
in the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by
Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of
Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be
purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and Pari Passu
Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness not
denominated in euro, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such aggregate principal amounts
into their Euro Equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Company that is within the Asset Disposition
Offer Period (as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds
will be reset at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a

currency other than the currency in which the Notes are denominated, the amount thereof payable in respect of
such Notes will not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which such Notes are denominated that is
actually received by the Company upon converting such portion into such currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, in so far as it relates to the Notes, will remain open for a period of not less

than 20 Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”). No later than five
Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset Disposition Purchase Date”),


-----

the Company will purchase the aggregate principal amount of Notes and, to the extent they elect, Pari Passu
Indebtedness required to be purchased pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset Disposition Offer Amount”) or, if
less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness
validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer.

On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Company will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment,

on a _pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Notes and Pari Passu_
Indebtedness or portions of Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn and, in the case of the Notes, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples
of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that such
Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Company in accordance with the terms of this
covenant. The Company or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, will promptly (but in any case not later than
five Business Days after termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each tendering
Holder of Notes an amount equal to the purchase price of the Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn
by such Holder, and accepted by the Company for purchase, and the Company will promptly issue a new Note (or
amend the Global Note), and the Trustee or its authenticating agent, upon delivery of an Officer’s Certificate from
the Company, will authenticate (or cause to be authenticated) and mail or deliver (or cause to be transferred by
book-entry) such new Note to such Holder, in an aggregate principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of
the Note surrendered; provided that each such new Note will be in an aggregate principal amount with a minimum
denomination of €100,000. Any Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by
book-entry) by the Company to the Holder thereof.

For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be cash:

(1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness of the Company or Indebtedness of a Restricted

Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company or a Guarantor) and the release of the Company
or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the

Company from the transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash
Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition;

(3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of

such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Company and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from
any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Company (other than Subordinated Indebtedness)

received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; and

(5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in

such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash
Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of
€160 million and 25% of Consolidated EBITDA (with the fair market value of each item of Designated Non-Cash
Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value).

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations (or exchange rules) conflict with

provisions of this covenant, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations (or
exchange rules) and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of any
conflict. The Company may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC
will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfied certain conditions.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, may make any Asset

Disposition Offer prior to the expiration of the 425-day (or 605-day, as applicable) period mentioned in this
covenant.


-----

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter

into or conduct any transaction (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering
of any service) with any Affiliate of the Company (an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate value in excess
of the greater of €64 million and 10% of Consolidated EBITDA unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the

Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable
transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such transaction in
arm’s length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involves an

aggregate value in excess of the greater of €128 million and 20% of Consolidated EBITDA, the terms of such
transaction have been approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company.

Any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in clause (2) of this

paragraph if such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors. If there are no
Disinterested Directors, any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in
this covenant if the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, delivers to the Trustee a
letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is fair to the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary from a financial point of view or stating that the terms are not materially less favorable to the Company
or its relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person on an arm’s length basis.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under “—

_Limitation on Restricted Payments” (other than pursuant to clause (9)(b)(ii) of the fourth paragraph of the_
covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”) or any Permitted Investment (other than
Permitted Investments as described in paragraphs (1)(b), (2), (11) and (18) of the definition thereof);

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities, or

other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or entering into,
or maintenance of, any employment, consulting, collective bargaining or benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and other compensation arrangements, options, warrants or
other rights to purchase Capital Stock of the Company, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent, restricted stock
plans, long-term incentive plans, stock appreciation rights plans, participation plans or similar employee benefits
or consultants’ plans (including valuation, health, insurance, deferred compensation, severance, retirement,
savings or similar plans, programs or arrangements) or indemnities provided on behalf of officers, employees,
directors or consultants approved by the Board of Directors of the Company, in each case in the ordinary course
of business or consistent with past practice;

(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;

(4) any transaction between or among the Company and any Restricted Subsidiary (or entity that

becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among Restricted Subsidiaries;

(5) the payment of reasonable fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary indemnities

(including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension expenses provided on behalf
of, directors, officers, consultants or employees of the Company, any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company or
any Parent (whether directly or indirectly and including through any Person owned or controlled by any of such
directors, officers or employees);

(6) the Transactions and the entry into and performance of obligations of the Company or any of its

Restricted Subsidiaries under the terms of any transaction arising out of, and any payments pursuant to or for
purposes of funding, any agreement or instrument in effect as of or on the Issue Date, as these agreements and
instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed or refinanced from time to time in
accordance with the other terms of this covenant or to the extent not more disadvantageous to the Holders in any


-----

material respect and the entry into and performance of any registration rights or other listing agreement in
connection with any Public Offering;

(7) (a) execution, delivery and performance of any Tax Sharing Agreement or the formation and

maintenance of any consolidated group for tax, accounting or cash pooling or management purposes in the
ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice; and (b) any Permitted Tax Restructuring;

(8) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in each

case in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice, which are fair to the Company or the
relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the reasonable determination by an Officer of the Company or the relevant
Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms no less favorable than those that could reasonably have been obtained at
such time from an unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice between or among

the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Company or an Associate or similar entity that
would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely because the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate
of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any Permitted Holder owns an equity interest in or
otherwise controls such Affiliate, Associate or similar entity (other than any RAN Entity);

(10) (a) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference

Shares) of the Company or options, warrants or other rights to acquire such Capital Stock or Subordinated
Shareholder Funding; and (b) any amendment, waiver or other transaction with respect to any Subordinated
Shareholder Funding in compliance with the other provisions of the Indenture;

(11) without duplication in respect of payments made pursuant to clause (12) hereof, (a) payments by the

Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder (whether directly or indirectly, including through
any Parent) of annual customary management, consulting, monitoring or advisory fees and related expenses in an
aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of €10 million and 1.5% of Consolidated EBITDA per year (with
unused amounts in any calendar year being carried over to the next two succeeding calendar years) and
(b) customary payments by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder (whether directly
or indirectly, including through any Parent) for financial advisory, financing, underwriting or placement services
or in respect of other investment banking activities, including in connection with acquisitions or divestitures,
which payments in respect of this clause (b) are approved by a majority of the Board of Directors of the Company
in good faith;

(12) payment to any Permitted Holder of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses Incurred by such

respect to loans outstanding thereunder; provided that clause (1) of the first paragraph of this covenant shall apply
to any such transaction;

(15) any Permitted Investment described in paragraph (18) of the definition thereof; _provided_ that

clause (1) of the first paragraph of this covenant shall apply to any such Permitted Investment;

(16) any transaction as to which the Company delivers to the Trustee a letter from an Independent

Financial Advisor stating that the transaction is fair to the Company from a financial point of view, or meets the
requirements of clause (1) of the first paragraph of this covenant;

(17) any purchases by the Company’s Affiliates of Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock of the Company

or any Restricted Subsidiary the majority of which Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock is purchased by persons
who are not the Company’s Affiliates; provided that such purchases by the Company’s Affiliates are on the same
terms as such purchases by such persons who are not the Company’s Affiliates;

(18) any:

(a) Investments by Affiliates in securities of the Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries

(and payment of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses Incurred by such Affiliates in connection therewith) so long


-----

as the Investment is being offered by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary generally to other non-affiliated
third party investors on the same or more favorable terms; and

(b) payments to Affiliates in respect of securities of the Company or any of the Restricted

Subsidiaries contemplated in sub-clause (a) above or that were acquired from persons other than the Company

(19) any transition services arrangement, supply arrangement or similar arrangement entered into in

connection with or in contemplation of the disposition of assets or Capital Stock in any Restricted Subsidiary
permitted under “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” or entered into with any Business
Successor, in each case, that the Company determines in good faith is either fair to the Company or otherwise on
customary terms for such type of arrangements in connection with similar transactions.

**_Reports_**

For so long as any Notes are outstanding, the Company will provide to the Trustee the following reports:

(1) within 120 days after the end of the Company’s fiscal year beginning with the first fiscal year ending

after the Issue Date, annual reports containing, to the extent applicable, the following information: (a) audited
consolidated balance sheets of the Company or its predecessor as of the end of the two most recent fiscal years
and audited consolidated income statements and statements of cash flow of the Company or its predecessor for
the two most recent fiscal years, including complete footnotes to such financial statements and the report of the
independent auditors on the financial statements; (b) unaudited pro forma income statement information and
balance sheet information of the Company (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include the provision of
a full income statement or balance sheet to the extent not reasonably available), together with explanatory
footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning
of the most recently completed fiscal year, provided that such pro forma financial information need not comply
with the requirements of Regulation S-X; (c) an operating and financial review of the audited financial statements,
including a discussion of the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and capital resources of the
Company, and a discussion of material commitments and contingencies and critical accounting policies;

Company beginning with the first fiscal quarter ending after the Issue Date, all quarterly reports of the Company
containing the following information: (a) an unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of the end of such
quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income and cash flow for the most recent quarter year-to-date
period ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date, and the comparable prior year periods, together
with condensed footnote disclosure; (b) unaudited pro forma income statement information and balance sheet
information of the Company (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include the provision of a full income

quarter, _provided that such pro forma financial information need not comply with the requirements_
of Regulation S-X; (c) an operating and financial review of the unaudited financial statements, including a
discussion of the results of operations, financial condition and material changes in liquidity and capital resources
of the Company, and a discussion of material changes not in the ordinary course of business in commitments and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of any material acquisition, disposition or restructuring or any senior

executive officer changes at the Company or change in auditors of the Company or any other material event that
the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries announces publicly, a report containing a description of such
event.

All financial statement and pro forma financial information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in

effect on the date of such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on
a consistent basis for the periods presented; provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3)
above may, in the event of a change in applicable IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to such
periods. Except as provided for above, no report need include separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries
of the Company.


-----

At any time that any of the Company’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted

Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, if taken together as one Subsidiary, constitutes a Significant
Subsidiary of the Company, then the annual and quarterly financial information required by clauses (1) and (2) of
the first paragraph of this covenant shall include either (i) a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of
the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the
Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Company or (ii) stand-alone audited or unaudited financial statements, as the case
may be, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary or Unrestricted Subsidiaries (as a group or otherwise) together with an
unaudited reconciliation to the financial information of the Company and its Subsidiaries, which reconciliation
shall include the following items: revenues, EBITDA, net income, cash, total assets, total debt, shareholders
equity, capital expenditure and interest expense.

Substantially concurrently with the issuance to the Trustee of the reports specified in clauses (1), (2) and

(3) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the Company shall also (a) use its commercially reasonable efforts (i) to
post copies of such reports on such website as may be then maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries or
(ii) otherwise to provide substantially comparable availability of such reports (as determined by the Company in
good faith and which shall include, for the avoidance of doubt, any Secured System), or (b) to the extent the
Company determines in good faith that it cannot make such reports available in the manner described in the
preceding clause (a) owing to applicable law or after the use of its commercially reasonable efforts, furnish such
reports to the Holders and, upon request, prospective purchasers of the Notes. The Company will also make
available copies of all reports required by clauses (1) through (3) of the first paragraph of this covenant, if and so
long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange and the rules of the
International Stock Exchange so require, at the offices of the Listing Agent in the Channel Islands or, to the extent
and in the manner permitted by such rules, on the official website of The International Stock Exchange. For the
purpose of this paragraph, “Secured System” shall mean Smartroom, Intralinks or any comparable password
protected online data system requiring user identification and a confidentiality acknowledgement. If the Company
uses the Secured System to satisfy such requirements, it shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make
available any password or other login information relating to the Secured System to Holders, bona fide prospective
investors (each, a “Prospective Investor”), security analysts who have certified to the Company that they are
reputable security analysts employed by a reputable financial institution who regularly cover or intend to cover
the Company and the Notes (each, a “Security Analyst”) and market makers who have certified to the Company
that they are reputable market makers who regularly make or intend to make a market in the Notes (each, a “Market
Maker”), and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make available on an Investor Relations page on its
external website contact information for being provided access to the Secured System to any Holders, Prospective
Investors, Security Analysts or Market Makers and reasonably promptly comply with any such requests for access
to the Secured System to the extent provided for herein. Any Person (other than the Trustee) who requests or
accesses such financial information required by this covenant will be required to represent to the Company (to the
reasonable good faith satisfaction of the Company) that: (i) it is a Holder, a Beneficial Owner of the Notes, a
Prospective Investor, a Market Maker or Securities Analyst; (ii) it will keep such information confidential and
will not communicate the information to any Person; and (iii) it is not a Person (which includes such Person’s
Affiliates) that (1) is principally engaged in a Similar Business or (2) derives a significant portion of its revenue
from operating a Similar Business.

Delivery of any information, documents and reports to the Trustee pursuant to this “Reports” covenant is for

informational purposes only and the Trustee’s receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any
information contained herein including the Company’s compliance with any of its covenants under the Indenture.

The Company may comply with any requirement to provide reports or financial statements under this

covenant by providing any report or financial statements of (x) a direct or indirect Parent of the Company or (y)
any report or financial statements of a direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Company that represents substantially
all the assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries (any entity under sub-clause (x) or (y), a “Financial
_Reporting Entity”), in each case (if such entity is different from the Company) so long as such reports (if an annual_
or quarterly report) (a) meet the requirements (including as to content and time of delivery) of clause (1) and (2)
of this covenant as if references to the Company therein were references to such Financial Reporting Entity and
(b) include (i) in the case of sub-clause (x), condensed consolidated financial information together with separate
columns for: (A) such Parent; (B) the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries on a combined basis; (C) any other
Subsidiaries of the Company on a combined basis; (D) consolidating adjustments; and (E) the total consolidated
amounts and (ii) in the case of sub-clause (y), a brief unaudited description of material differences between the
financial statements of the Financial Reporting Entity and the Company shall be included in such report or


-----

financial statements. Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Company will be deemed to have
complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

Additionally, in the event that, and for so long as, the equity securities of the Company or any Parent or IPO

Entity are listed on a Recognized Stock Exchange and the Company or such Parent or IPO Entity is subject to the
Admission and Disclosure Standards applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted to trading on such
Recognized Stock Exchange, for so long as it elects, the Company will make available to the Trustee such annual
reports, information, documents and other reports that the Issuer or such Parent or IPO Entity is, or would be,
required to file with such Recognized Stock Exchange. Upon complying with the foregoing requirements, and
_provided that (i) such requirements require the Issuer or any Parent or IPO Entity to prepare and file annual reports,_
information, documents and other reports with the Recognized Stock Exchange, and (ii) the Company provides
quarterly earnings report for the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year to the Trustee, the
Company will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that (i) the Company or the Issuer becomes subject to the

reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions,
for so long as it continues to file the reports required by Section 13(a) with the SEC, or (ii) the Company elects to
provide to the Trustee reports which, if filed with the SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the
Company) the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the provision of
U.S. GAAP information, certifications, exhibits or information as to internal controls and procedures), for so long
as it elects, the Company will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other
reports that the Company is, or would be, required to file with the SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d) or,
the Company will be deemed to have furnished such reports referred to above to the Trustee and the Holders if it
has filed (or, in the case of an Item 2.02 or Item 7.01 Form 8-K, furnished) such reports with the SEC and such
reports are publicly available. Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Company will be deemed to
have complied with the provisions contained in this covenant.

**_Merger and Consolidation_**

_The Issuer_

The Issuer will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all

its assets to, any Person, unless:

(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor Issuer”) will be a Person organized and

existing under the laws of any member state of the European Union or the United States of America, any State of
the United States or the District of Columbia, Canada or any province of Canada, Jersey, Norway or Switzerland
and the Successor Issuer (if not the Issuer) will expressly assume (a) by supplemental indenture, executed and
delivered to the Trustee, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Issuer under the
Notes and the Indenture and (b) all obligations of the Issuer under the Security Documents (and, to the extent
required by the Intercreditor Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement);

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an

obligation of the Successor Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Successor Issuer as a result of such transaction as
having been Incurred by the Successor Issuer or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default or
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; and

(3) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel,

each to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply
with the Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental indenture (if any) has been duly
authorized, executed and delivered and is a legal, valid and binding agreement enforceable against the Successor
Issuer (in each case, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee), _provided that in giving an_
Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact, including as to
satisfaction of clauses (1) and (2) above.

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or

substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Issuer, which properties and assets,
if held by the Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the properties and
assets of the Issuer on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the
properties and assets of the Issuer.


-----

The Successor Issuer will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the

Issuer under the Indenture but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets, the predecessor company
will not be released from its obligations under the Indenture or the Notes.

Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2) and (3) and the provisions described below under “—The

_Company” and “—Subsidiary Guarantors” (which do not apply to transactions referred to in this sentence), (a) any_
Restricted Subsidiary of the Company may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or
part of its properties and assets to the Issuer, and (b) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate or otherwise
combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to any other Restricted Subsidiary.
Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2) and (3) (which do not apply to the transactions referred to in this
sentence), the Issuer may consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or
organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of the Issuer, reincorporating the Issuer in another
jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the Issuer.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly,

in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve
“all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant)

will not apply to the creation of a new subsidiary of the Issuer that becomes a parent of one or more of the Issuer’s
Subsidiaries.

_The Company_

The Company will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially

all its assets to, any Person, unless:

(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor Company”) will be a Person organized

and existing under the laws of any member state of the European Union or the United States of America, any State
of the United States or the District of Columbia, Canada or any province of Canada, Jersey, Norway or Switzerland
and the Successor Company (if not the Company) will expressly assume (a) by supplemental indenture, executed
and delivered to the Trustee, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Company
under the Parent Guarantee and (b) all obligations of the Company under the Security Documents (and, to the
extent required by the Intercreditor Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement);

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an

obligation of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the Successor Company as a result of such transaction
as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default
or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Successor Company would be able

to Incur at least an additional €1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (b) the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio of the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries would not be greater than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel,

each to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply
with the Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental indenture (if any) has been duly
authorized, executed and delivered and is a legal, valid and binding agreement enforceable against the Successor
Company (in each case, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee), provided that in giving an
Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact, including as to
satisfaction of clauses (2) and above.

Any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (or that is deemed

to be Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a result of any such
transaction undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and any Refinancing Indebtedness with respect thereto,
shall be deemed to have been Incurred in compliance with the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness.”_


-----

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or

substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Company, which properties and
assets, if held by the Company instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the
properties and assets of the Company on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of,

the Company under the Indenture but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets, the predecessor
company will not be released from its obligations under the Indenture or the Notes.

Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2) and (3) and the provisions described above under “—The Issuer”

and below under “—Subsidiary Guarantors” (which do not apply to transactions referred to in this sentence) and,
other than with respect to the second preceding paragraph, clause (4) of the first paragraph of this covenant, (a) any
Restricted Subsidiary of the Company may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or
part of its properties and assets to the Company and (b) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate or otherwise
combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to any other Restricted Subsidiary.
Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2), (3) and (4) (which do not apply to the transactions referred to in this
sentence), the Company may consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or
organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of the Company, reincorporating the Company in another
jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the Company.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly,

in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve
“all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant)

will not apply to the creation of a new subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company.

_Subsidiary Guarantors_

No Subsidiary Guarantor may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person;

(2) sell, convey, transfer or dispose of, all or substantially all its assets as an entirety or substantially as

an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any Person; or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into such Guarantor, unless

(a) the other Person is the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor (or becomes a

Guarantor concurrently with the transaction); or

(b) (i) either (x) a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting, surviving or

transferee Person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Guarantor under its Guarantee and the Security
Documents (and, to the extent required by the Intercreditor Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement); and

(i) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default has occurred and is

continuing; or

(c) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or

merger) of the Subsidiary Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Subsidiary
Guarantor (in each case other than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the
Indenture.

Notwithstanding the preceding clause (b)(ii) and the provisions described above under “—The Issuer” and

“—The Company,” (which do not apply to transactions referred to in this sentence), (a) any Restricted Subsidiary
may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to a
Subsidiary Guarantor and (b) any Subsidiary Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into
or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to any other Subsidiary Guarantor. Notwithstanding the preceding
clause (b)(ii) (which does not apply to the transactions referred to in this sentence), a Subsidiary Guarantor may


-----

consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of
changing the legal domicile of the Subsidiary Guarantor reincorporating the Subsidiary Guarantor in another
jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the Subsidiary Guarantor.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly,

in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve
“all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

The provisions set forth in this covenant shall not restrict (and shall not apply to) any Permitted

Reorganization.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no Default or

Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then, beginning on that day and
continuing until the Reversion Date, the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following captions will
not apply to such Notes: “—Limitation on Restricted Payments,” “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” “—Limitation
_on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries,” “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions,” “—_
_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock,” “—Additional Guarantees,” “—Impairment of Security_
_Interest,” and the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Merger and_
_Consolidation—The Company,” and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be_
effective and will not be applicable to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries. Such covenants and any
related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the first day on which a Suspension Event
ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to actions of the Company
properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension Event, and the “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”
covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of the Indenture except that no default will be
deemed to have occurred solely by reason of a Restricted Payment made while that covenant was suspended. On
the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be classified,
at the Company’s option, as having been Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Indebtedness” or one of the clauses set forth in the second paragraph of such covenant (to the
extent such Indebtedness would be permitted to be Incurred thereunder as of the Reversion Date and after giving
effect to Indebtedness Incurred prior to the Suspension Event and outstanding on the Reversion Date). To the
extent such Indebtedness would not be so permitted to be incurred under the first two paragraphs of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” such Indebtedness will be deemed to have been outstanding on
the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

**_Financial Calculations_**

When calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the Indenture applicable in connection with

any transaction (including, for the avoidance of doubt and without limitation, any Incurrence or assumption of
Indebtedness or Liens, the making of any Restricted Payment, Permitted Payment or Investment, any Asset
Disposition, any acquisition, merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other business combination, any transaction
requiring the testing of any basket based on the Consolidated EBITDA of the Company), the date of determination
of such basket or ratio and of any Default or Event of Default shall, at the option of the Company, be the date the
definitive agreements for such transaction are entered into, and such baskets or ratios shall be calculated with such
_pro forma adjustments as are appropriate and consistent with the pro forma provisions set forth in the definitions_
of Consolidated EBITDA and Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio after giving effect to such transaction and other
transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of
proceeds thereof) as if they had occurred at the beginning of the applicable period for purposes of determining the
ability to consummate any such transaction (and not for purposes of any subsequent availability of any basket or
ratio), and, for the avoidance of doubt, (x) if any of such baskets or ratios are exceeded as a result of fluctuations
in such basket or ratio (including due to fluctuations in the Consolidated Net Income or Consolidated EBITDA of
the Issuer or that arise from an asset or a target company subject to such transaction) subsequent to such date of
determination and at or prior to the consummation of the relevant transaction, such baskets or ratios will not be
deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether the
transaction is permitted hereunder and (y) such baskets or ratios shall not be tested at the time of consummation
of such transaction or related transactions; provided that if the Issuer elects to have such determinations occur at
the time of entry into such definitive agreement, any such transactions (including any Incurrence of Indebtedness
and the use of proceeds therefrom) shall be deemed to have occurred on the date the definitive agreements are


-----

entered into and be outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets or ratios under the Indenture
after the date of such agreement and before the consummation of such transaction. To the extent the date of
determination of a basket or ratio is tested prior to the date of consummation of a transaction, such basket or ratio
shall be deemed utilized to the same extent until the earlier of the date of consummation of such transaction or the
date such transaction is terminated or expires without consummation, except that in the case of an acquisition,
merger or consolidation, any calculation of Consolidated EBITDA for purposes other than Incurrences of
Indebtedness or Liens or the making of Restricted Payments (not related to such acquisition, merger or
consolidation) shall not reflect such transaction until it has been consummated.

**_Additional Guarantees_**

The Company will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors, directly or

indirectly, to Guarantee any Indebtedness under the Senior Facilities Agreement (or other Indebtedness that is
Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness”) or Public Debt in whole or in part unless such Restricted Subsidiary becomes a Guarantor on the_
date on which such other Guarantee is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a
supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will
provide a Guarantee, which Guarantee will be senior to or pari passu with such Restricted Subsidiary’s Guarantee
of such other Indebtedness.

Future guarantees granted pursuant to this provision may be released in accordance with the Notes Guarantees

release provisions in the Indenture. In addition, future guarantees of the Notes granted pursuant to this provision
shall be released at the option of the Company upon such Guarantor being unconditionally released and discharged
from its liability with respect to the Indebtedness giving rise to the requirement to provide such Note Guarantee,
so long as no other Indebtedness guaranteed by, or incurred by, the relevant Guarantor would have required that
such Guarantor provide a Note Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Indenture immediately after the release of
such Note Guarantee.

A Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor may become a Guarantor if it executes and delivers to the

Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted
Subsidiary will provide a Guarantee.

Each additional Guarantee will be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to

guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial
assistance, corporate purpose, thin capitalization, distributable reserves, capital maintenance or similar laws,
regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to cause such Restricted Subsidiary to

Guarantee the Notes to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Guarantee could reasonably be expected
to give rise to or result in: (1) any violation of applicable law or regulation; (2) any liability for the officers,
directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted
Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners
of such partnership); (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and other than reasonable expenses incurred in connection with any
governmental or regulatory filings required as a result of, or any measures pursuant to clause (1) of this paragraph
undertaken in connection with, such Guarantee, which in any case under any of clauses (1), (2) and (3) of this
paragraph cannot be avoided through measures reasonably available to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary;
or (4) an inconsistency with the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or omit to take any action that

would have the result of materially impairing the security interest with respect to the Collateral (it being
understood that the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially
impair the security interest with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders; provided
that the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur Permitted Collateral Liens and the Collateral may be
discharged, transferred or released in accordance with the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement or the applicable Security Document.


-----

Notwithstanding the above, the Security Documents may be amended, extended, renewed, restated,

supplemented or otherwise modified or released (followed by a substantially concurrent retaking of a Lien of at
least equivalent ranking over the same assets) to (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency therein;
(2) provide for Permitted Collateral Liens; (3) add to the Collateral; (4) for purposes of undertaking a Permitted
Reorganization or a transaction not prohibited by the covenant set forth under “—Merger and Consolidation”;
(5) make any other change thereto that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect as determined
by the Company in good faith; or (6) amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement, replace or otherwise modify or
release any Security Documents followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over
the same asset; provided, however, that, in the case of clauses (5) and (6) above, except where permitted by the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, no Security Document may be
amended, extended, renewed, restated, or otherwise modified or released (followed by an immediate retaking of
a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), unless contemporaneously with such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement or modification or release, the Company delivers to the Security
Agent and the Trustee, either (a) a solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Security
Agent and the Trustee, from an Independent Financial Advisor or appraiser or investment bank of international
standing which confirms the solvency of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect
to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or
release (followed by an immediate retaking of a lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), (b) a
certificate from the chief financial officer or the Board of Directors of the relevant Person which confirms the
solvency of the person granting Liens after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension,
renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement, or (c) an opinion of counsel (subject to any
qualifications customary for this type of opinion of counsel), in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Security Agent and the Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a lien
of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), the Lien or Liens created under the Security Document, so
amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified or released and replaced are valid and perfected
Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such
Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, modification or replacement and to which the new Indebtedness secured by the Permitted
Collateral Lien is not subject.

In the event that the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries comply with the requirements of this covenant,

the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such
amendments without the need for instructions from the Holders.

**_Limitation on Activities of the Issuer_**

The Issuer will not engage in any business activity or undertake any other activity, except any activity

(a) subject to compliance with the terms of the Indenture, related to the offering, sale or issuance of the Notes or
the incurrence of Indebtedness by the Issuer represented by the Notes or any Public Debt, (b) undertaken with the
purpose of, and directly related to, fulfilling its obligations under the Notes, the Indenture and any other document
relating to the Notes (including the Notes Proceeds Loan), the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement,
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Facilities Agreement or any document relating to any
Public Debt, (c) related to reorganizations for bona fide corporate purposes in compliance the covenant described
under “—Merger and Consolidation”; provided that any successor entity resulting from any such reorganization
is subject to this covenant, (d) related to the granting of security interests, indemnities and payment of overhead
costs or taxes and the entry into any Security Document to which it is a party, (e) related to the establishment and
maintenance of the Issuer’s corporate existence, (f) related to using amounts received by the Issuer to make
investments in cash or Cash Equivalents in a manner not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture or (g) reasonably
related to the foregoing. The Issuer will not (i) incur any Indebtedness (except to eircom Limited (Jersey)) other
than, subject to compliance with the terms of the Indenture, the Notes or any Public Debt, or (ii) issue any Capital
Stock (other than to eircom Limited (Jersey)).

The Issuer and the Company will not, and will not permit any of the Company’s Restricted Subsidiaries or

any other Person that is an obligor under the Notes Proceeds Loan Agreement, to amend, modify, supplement or
waive any rights under the Notes Proceeds Loan Agreement in a manner that would adversely affect the rights of
the Issuer or its creditors with respect to the Notes Proceeds Loan Agreement.

The foregoing provisions of this covenant will fall away if the Issuer is consolidated or merged in compliance

with the covenant under the caption “—Merger and Consolidation.”


-----

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an Event of Default under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Note when due and payable,

continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note issued under the

Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration
or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to comply for 60 days after written

notice by the Trustee on behalf of the Holders or by the Holders of 30% (or more) in aggregate principal amount
of the outstanding Notes with its other agreements including those described under “Change of Control” above or
under the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants” above contained in the Indenture;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which

there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) other
than Indebtedness owed to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now
exists, or is created after the date hereof, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at stated maturity on such Indebtedness, immediately upon

the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness (“payment default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the “cross acceleration

provision”);

and, in each case, the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the aggregate
principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the maturity
of which has been so accelerated, aggregates €125.0 million or more;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Company, the Issuer or a

Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy provisions”);

(6) failure by the Company, the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries

that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of
€125.0 million (exclusive of any amounts that a solvent insurance company has acknowledged liability for), which
judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after the judgment becomes final (the
“judgment default provision”);

(7) any security interest under the Security Documents on any Collateral having a Fair Market Value in

excess of €40.0 million shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the
terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture) for any reason other than
the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture or the release or amendment of any such security
interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or such Security Document or
any such security interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary shall assert in writing that any such security interest is invalid or unenforceable and any
such Default continues for 10 days (the “security default provision”); and

(8) any Guarantee of the Company or a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect (other

than in accordance with the terms of such Guarantee or the Indenture) or is declared invalid or unenforceable in a
judicial proceeding or any Guarantor denies or disaffirms in writing its obligations under its Guarantee and any
such Default continues for 10 days (the “guarantee provision”).

However, a default under clauses (3), (4) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until

the Trustee or the Holders of 30% (or more) in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the
Company of the default and, with respect to clauses (3), (4) and (6), the Company does not cure such default
within the time specified in clauses (3), (4) or (6), as applicable, of this paragraph after receipt of such notice.


-----

Notwithstanding any other term of the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Security Document,

no Permitted Reorganization shall (or shall be deemed to) constitute, or result in, a breach of any representation,
warranty, undertaking or other term in the Indenture or any Security Document, or a Default or an Event of
Default.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is continuing,

the Trustee by notice to the Company or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may declare the principal of, premium, if
any, and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on all the Notes to be due and payable.
Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts,
if any, will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an
Event of Default described in clause (4) under “Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration
of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering
such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the
Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full,
within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration
of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing
Events of Default, except non-payment of principal, premium or interest, including Additional Amounts, if any,
on the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived.

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if

any, and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on all the Notes will become and be
immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may

waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to non-payment of principal, premium
or interest, or Additional Amounts, if any) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its
consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate

in connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is cured,
such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default
that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default
or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Certain
_Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the_
Indenture shall be deemed to be cured, upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such
notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the
Indenture.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs

and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the
Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee
indemnity and/or security (including by way of pre-funding) satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability
and/or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may
pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in

writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered in writing the Trustee security and/or indemnity (including by way of

pre-funding) against any loss, liability and/or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request

and the offer of security and/or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the

Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day
period.


-----

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding

Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy
available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture will provide
that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing of which a Responsible Officer of the Trustee
has written notice, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent
person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that
conflicts with law, its fiduciary duties or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the
rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under
the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security (including by way of payment in
advance) satisfactory to it against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.

The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and a Responsible Officer of the Trustee

is informed in writing of such occurrence by the Company, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the
Holders within 90 days after being notified by the Company. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of
principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as a
committee of trust officers of the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the
Holders. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an
Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous
year. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written
notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the
Company is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

The Notes provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only

if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured (including by way of prefunding) to its satisfaction. It may not be
possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the
Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity and/or security (including by
way of prefunding) to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Note Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified

with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding
(including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such Notes)
and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the
consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including
consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such Notes); provided
that, if any amendment, waiver or other modification will only amend one series of the Notes, only the consent of
a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of such series shall be required. However, without
the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% (or, in the case of clause (8), 75%) of the then outstanding
aggregate principal amount of any series of Notes affected, an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any
such series of the Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of such Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Note or change the time at which any

such Note may be redeemed, in each case as described above under “—Optional Redemption”;

(5) make any such Note payable in money other than that stated in such Note;

(6) amend the contractual right of any Holder to bring suit for the payment of principal, premium, if

any, and interest on its Note, on or after the respective due dates expressed or provided for in such Note;

(7) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under “—Withholding Taxes” that

adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Notes in any material respect or amends the terms of such Notes
in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described thereunder or an exemption


-----

from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder unless the Payor agrees to pay Additional
Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(8) release (i) all or substantially all security interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the

Collateral or (ii) all or substantially all of the Guarantors from their obligations under the Note Guarantees or the
Indenture, in each case, other than pursuant to the terms of the Security Document or the Indenture, as applicable,
except as permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(9) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the non-payment of principal, premium or interest

(except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate
principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration); or

(10) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent

described in this sentence.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Company, the Trustee and the other

parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Note Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency, conform any provision of any Note

Document to this “Description of the Notes,” or reduce the minimum denomination of the Notes;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Company, the Issuer or

any Guarantor under any Note Document;

(3) provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes (provided that the

uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code, or in a manner such
that the uncertificated Notes are described in Section 163(f)(2)(B) of the Code) or change the minimum
denomination for the Notes;

(4) add to the covenants or provide for a Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any right

or power conferred upon the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder in any material respect or

that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Holders or the Trustee;

(6) at the Company’s election, comply with any requirement of the SEC in connection with the

qualification of the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act, if such qualification is required;

(7) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Company) for the issuance

of Additional Notes;

(8) to provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Guarantee in accordance with the Covenant

described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Additional
_Guarantees,” to add Guarantees with respect to the Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of the Notes, or to_
confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Guarantee or Lien (including the
Collateral and the Security Documents) with respect to or securing the Notes when such release, termination,
discharge or retaking is provided for under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents;

(9) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture of a successor

Trustee pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee to any Note Document;
or

(10) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest

in favor of the Security Agent in any property which is required to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in
which a security interest is required to be granted, to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a
security interest for the benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of such security interest is not prohibited
by the Indenture and the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” is
complied with.


-----

The Trustee shall be entitled to receive and to rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate

including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed

amendment or supplement of any Note Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the
proposed amendment or supplement. A consent to any amendment or supplement or waiver under the Indenture
by any Holder of Notes given in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by
such tender.

**Acts by Holders**

In determining whether the Holders of the required aggregate principal amount of the Notes have concurred

in any direction, waiver or consent, any Notes owned by the Company or by any Person directly or indirectly
controlled, or controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with, the Company will be disregarded
and deemed not to be outstanding.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all its and each Guarantor’s obligations under the Notes and the

Indenture (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain
obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and
indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning
issuing temporary Notes, registrations of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of
an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the
Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the Security Documents in effect at such time will terminate (other
than with respect to the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate its and the Guarantor’s obligations under the covenants described under

“—Certain Covenants” (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of each of the covenants described under
“—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer,” “—Certain Covenants—Merger and
_Consolidation—The Company” and “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—Subsidiary_
_Guarantors”) and “—Change of Control” and the default provisions relating to such covenants described under_
“—Events of Default” above, the operation of the cross-default upon a payment default, the cross acceleration
provision, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to the Company, the Issuer and its Significant Subsidiaries, the
judgment default provision, the guarantee provision and the security default provision described under “—Events
_of Default” above (“covenant defeasance”)._

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise

of its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes may
not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to the Notes. If the Issuer exercises its covenant
defeasance option with respect to the Notes, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of
Default specified in clause (3) (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of each of the covenants described
under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer,” “—Certain Covenants—Merger and
_Consolidation—The Company” and “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—Subsidiary_
_Guarantors”), (4), (5) (with respect only to the Company, the Issuer and Significant Subsidiaries), (6), (7) or_
(8) under “—Events of Default” above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the “defeasance

trust”) with the Trustee (or such entity designated by the Trustee for this purpose) cash in euro, non-callable
Government Obligations or a combination thereof in such amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a
nationally recognized investment bank, appraisal firm or firm of independent public accountants, for the payment
of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and must
comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel of recognized standing with respect to U.S. federal income tax matters to the

effect that Holders of the Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a
result of such deposit and defeasance (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel must be
based on a ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law
since the issuance of the Notes);


-----

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of

defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer;

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to

customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to
legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with;

(4) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit does not constitute, or is

qualified as, a regulated investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940; and

(5) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee all other documents or other information that the Trustee may

reasonably require in connection with either defeasance option.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Security Document will be discharged

and cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange of the Notes,
as expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all outstanding Notes when (1) either (a) all the Notes previously
authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes and certain Notes for which
provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Company) have
been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or (b) all Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for
cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within
one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for
the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has
irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or such entity designated by the Trustee for this
purpose), euro or non-callable Government Obligations or a combination thereof, in an amount sufficient to pay
and discharge the entire indebtedness on the Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for
principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Notes that have become due and
payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be
paid all other sums payable under the Indenture; (4) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions under the
Indenture to apply the deposited money towards payment of the Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as
the case may be; and (5) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel
each to the effect that all conditions precedent under the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the
Indenture have been complied with, provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to
matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)).

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or

Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Note Documents or for
any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a
Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of
the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is
the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents**

Deutsche Trustee Company Limited has been appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will

provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a Responsible Officer of the Trustee
has received written notice, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in the Indenture.
During the existence of an Event of Default of which a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has received written
notice, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same
degree of care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee
to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or
duty.

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the

Company, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any
such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the
Company and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.


-----

The Indenture sets out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced. Such terms

will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Company
and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is not eliminated or (b) becomes
incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Company may remove the Trustee, or
any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than six months may petition any court for removal of
the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by

the successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, taxes and

expenses incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud on its part, arising out of or in connection
with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

**Notices**

All notices to Holders of Notes will be validly given if mailed to them at their respective addresses in the

register of the Holders of the Notes, if any, maintained by the Registrar. In addition, for so long as any of the
Notes are listed on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange and the rules of The International Stock
Exchange shall so require, notices with respect to the Notes will be published, to the extent and in the manner
permitted by such rules, on the official website of The International Stock Exchange (www.tisegroup.com/). In
addition, for so long as any Notes are represented by a Global Note, all notices to Holders of the Notes will be
delivered, in English, to Euroclear and Clearstream, delivery of which shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements
of this paragraph, each of which will give such notices to the holders of Book-Entry Interests.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more

than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are mailed,
such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh day after being so
mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or
other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed.
Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect
to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether
or not the addressee receives it.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on the Notes will

be prescribed five years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims against the Issuer for the
payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed three years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity**

Euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Company and the Guarantors

under or in connection with the Notes and the relevant Guarantees, as the case may be, including damages. Any
amount received or recovered in a currency other than euro whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a
judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Guarantor or
otherwise by any Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or a
Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the euro
amount which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on
the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date
on which it is practicable to do so).

If that euro amount is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee under any

Note, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such recipient or the Trustee
as a result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient or the Trustee on a joint or
several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency indemnity provision,
it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder of a Note or the Trustee to certify in a
manner reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer (indicating the sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in
making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuer’s


-----

and the Guarantors’ other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply
irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Note or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities
set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a
liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Note, any Guarantee or to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any euro
denominated restriction herein, the Euro Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a non-euro
currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such non-euro
amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since substantially all the assets of the Company are held by Subsidiaries located outside the United States,

except with respect to Meteor Ireland Holdings, LLC, any judgment obtained in the United States against the
Issuer or any Guarantor, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium, if any, interest,
Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Notes or the
Guarantees, may not be collectable within the United States.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture and the Notes

and the Guarantees, the Issuer and each Guarantor have in the Indenture irrevocably submitted to the jurisdiction
of the federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, County and State of New
York, United States.

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

On the Issue Date, the Global Note will be deposited with the common depositary, and registered in the

name of, the nominee of a common depositary, for Euroclear Bank SA/NV (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream
Banking, S.A. (“Clearstream”). Each series of Notes will initially be represented by a global note in registered
form without interest coupons attached (the “Global Note”).

After the closing date, Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only

through, records maintained in book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. Ownership
of interests in the Global Note (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with
Euroclear or Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through those participants. In addition, while the Notes
are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not be considered the owners or “holders” of Notes for
any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and

Clearstream will be considered the sole holder of Global Note for all purposes under the Indenture governing the
Notes. Accordingly, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and indirect
participants must rely on the procedures of the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests, to
transfer the interests or in order to exercise any rights of holders under the Indenture governing the Notes. The
Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note will be issued only in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples
of €1,000 in excess thereof.

Neither we, the Trustee, any Paying Agent, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent, the common depositary

for Euroclear and Clearstream nor any of our or their respective agents will have any responsibility or be liable
for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Issuance of Definitive Registered Notes**

The Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, Euroclear or Clearstream will credit

on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems a participant’s account with the interest
beneficially owned by that participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including some states of the United States,
may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of those securities in definitive form. The
foregoing limitations may impair your ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while
the Notes are in global form, “holders” of Book-Entry Interests will not be considered the owners or “holders” of
Notes for any purpose.

Under the terms of the Indenture governing the Notes, to the extent permitted by Euroclear or

Clearstream, owners of Book-Entry Interests will receive definitive Notes in registered form (“Definitive
Registered Notes”):

##### • if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act and we do not
appoint a successor within 90 days; or

##### • if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through Euroclear or
Clearstream following an event of default under the Indenture and enforcement action is being taken in
respect thereof under the Indenture.

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest

described in the immediately preceding clause, their current procedure is to request that we issue or cause to be
issued Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests.

In such an event, the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names

and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable
(in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from participants
reflecting the beneficial ownership of the Book-Entry Interests). Those Definitive Registered Notes will bear the
restrictive legend described under “Transfer Restrictions” unless that legend is not required at the time by the
Indenture governing the Notes or applicable law.

**Redemption of the Global Note**

In the event the Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear or Clearstream (or their

respective nominees), as applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in that Global Note
from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of the Global Note. The redemption price payable in


-----

connection with the redemption of the Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear or
Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of the Global Note (or any portion thereof). We
understand that, under existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be
redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a
proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or on any other basis that they deem fair and
appropriate (including the pool factor); provided, however, that no book-entry interest of less than €100,000
principal amount may be deemed in part.

**Payments on the Global Note**

Payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Note (including principal, premium, if any,

interest, additional interest and additional amounts) will be made by us in euros to the Principal Paying Agent.
The Principal Paying Agent will, in turn, make payments to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream,
which will distribute those payments to participants in accordance with its procedures. Under the terms of the
Indenture governing the Notes, we, the Trustee, any Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will treat
the registered holder of the Global Note as the owner of the Notes for the purpose of receiving payments and for
all other purposes. Consequently, neither we nor the Trustee, any Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the
Registrar nor any of our or their agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

##### • any aspect of the records of (or maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of) Euroclear,
Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to or payments made on account of a BookEntry Interest; or for monitoring, supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear or Clearstream or
any participant or indirect participant relating to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest;

##### • any other matter relating to the actions and practices of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participants indirect
participants; or

##### • the common depositary, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the

responsibility of those participants, as is the case with securities held for the accounts of customers registered in
“street name.”

To the extent permitted by law, we, the Trustee, any Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar

shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof and no person will
be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Global Note will be evidenced through
registration from time to time at the registered office of the Company, and such registration is a means of
evidencing title to the Notes.

We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the Book-Entry

Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear
and Clearstream.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a

holder of Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the
Global Note are credited and only in respect of the portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes for which
the participant or participants has or have given direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any
discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Note.
However, if there is an event of default under the Notes, each of Euroclear and Clearstream reserves the right to
exchange the Global Note for Definitive Registered Notes in certificated form, and to distribute those Definitive
Registered Notes to its participants.

**Transfers**

The Global Note will bear a legend as described under “Transfer Restrictions.” Book-Entry Interests in

the Global Note will be subject to restrictions on transfer described under “Transfer Restrictions.”

Prior to 40 days after the date of initial issuance of the Notes, ownership interests in Global Note will be

limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or persons who hold interests through
Euroclear or Clearstream and any sale or transfer of interests to U.S. persons will not be permitted.


-----

Transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with

Euroclear and Clearstream rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder requires physical
delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell Notes to persons in jurisdictions which
require physical delivery of securities or to pledge such securities, such holder must transfer its interests in the
Global Note in accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the
procedures set out in the Indenture governing the Notes.

Definitive Registered Notes, if any, may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a

Global Note only pursuant to the terms of the Indenture governing the Notes and, if required, only after the
transferor first delivers to the Trustee or relevant agent (in accordance with the terms of the Indenture governing
the Notes) a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture governing the Notes) to the effect that the
transfer will comply with the appropriate Transfers applicable to those Notes.

**Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book-Entry System**

Application will be made for the Notes to be admitted to trading on the Official List of the Exchange.

The Issuer expects that secondary trading in any certificated Notes will also be settled in immediately available
funds. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the common
depositary.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream are expected to follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate

transfers of interests in the Global Note among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, they are under no
obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or
modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Company, the Trustee, any Paying Agent, the Transfer Agents or
the Registrar will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear or Clearstream, or their respective
participants or indirect participants, of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their
operations.

**_Initial Settlement_**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euros. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or

Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional Eurobonds in registered
form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody account of Euroclear and Clearstream holders
on the business day following the settlement date against payment for value on the settlement date.

**_Secondary Market Trading_**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear and Clearstream, and will settle in

same-day funds. Since the sale determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading
of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement
can be made on the desired value date.

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

We understand the following with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream:

##### • Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations and facilitate the clearance and
settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book- entry
changes in accounts of those participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide to their participants, among
other things, services for safekeeping, administration, clearance and settlement of internationally traded
securities and securities lending and borrowing. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic
securities markets.

##### • Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers
and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear or
Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear
through or maintain a custodian relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly
or indirectly.

**TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

**Irish Taxation**

_The following is a summary of the principal Irish withholding tax consequences for individuals and_

_companies of ownership of the Notes and some other miscellaneous tax matters based on the laws and practice of_
_the Irish Revenue Commissioners currently in force in Ireland and may be subject to change. It deals with_
_Noteholders who beneficially own their Notes as an investment and who are not associated with the Issuer_
_(otherwise than by virtue of holding the Notes). Particular rules not discussed below may apply to certain classes_
_of taxpayers holding Notes, such as dealers in securities, trusts etc. The summary does not constitute tax or legal_
_advice and the comments below are of a general nature only. Prospective investors in the Notes should consult_
_their professional advisers on the tax implications of the purchase, holding, redemption or sale of the Notes and_
_the receipt of interest thereon under the laws of their country of residence, citizenship or domicile._

**Withholding Tax**

In general, tax at the standard rate of income tax (currently 20%), is required to be withheld from payments

of Irish source interest, which should include interest payable on the Notes. Subject to the discussion below, the
Issuer will not be obliged to make a withholding or deduction for or on account of Irish income tax from a payment
of interest on a Note so long as the following conditions are met:

(a) the Notes are quoted Eurobonds, i.e. securities which are issued by a company (such
as the Issuer), which are quoted on a recognized stock exchange which is interpreted
by the Irish Revenue Commissioners to mean an exchange which is recognized by the
appropriate regulatory authorities in the country in which it is located and has
substantially the same level of recognition in that country as the Irish Stock Exchange
has in Ireland, and which carry a right to interest; and

(b) the person by or through whom the payment is made is not in Ireland, or if such person
is in Ireland either:

(i) the Notes are held in a clearing system recognized by the Irish Revenue
Commissioners (DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg are, amongst
others, so recognized); or

(ii) the person who is the beneficial owner of the Notes and the return payable on
the Notes is not resident in Ireland and has made a declaration to a relevant
person (such as a paying agent located in Ireland) in the prescribed form.

Thus, subject to the discussion below, so long as the Notes continue to be quoted on a recognized stock

exchange and are held in a clearing system recognized by the Irish Revenue Commissioners, interest on the Notes
can be paid by any paying agent acting on behalf of the Issuer free of any withholding or deduction for or on
account of Irish income tax. If the Notes continue to be quoted but cease to be held in a recognized clearing
system, interest on the Notes may be paid without any withholding or deduction for or on account of Irish income
tax provided such payment is made through a paying agent outside Ireland.

Interest or other distributions paid out on the Notes which are profit-dependent or any part of which exceeds

a reasonable commercial return could, under certain anti-avoidance provisions, be re-characterized as a nondeductible distribution and so be subject to dividend withholding tax in certain circumstances. However, this
should not apply on the basis of a confirmation by the Issuer that, at the time the Notes were issued, the Issuer
was not in possession or aware of any information, including information about any arrangement or understanding
in relation to ownership of the Notes after that time, which could reasonably be taken to indicate that interest or
other distributions paid on the Notes would not be subject, without reduction computed by reference to the amount
of such interest or other distribution, to a tax in a relevant territory which generally applies to profits, income or
gains received in that relevant territory by persons from sources outside that relevant territory, where the term
“relevant territory” means a member state of the European Union (other than Ireland) or a country with which
Ireland has signed a double tax treaty.

Anti-avoidance rules set out in Section 110 of the Taxes Consolidation 1997 Act (as amended) restrict the

deductibility of interest paid by a qualifying company (such as the Issuer) that is profit dependent or exceeds a
reasonable commercial return to the extent that the interest is associated with a ‘specified property business’


-----

carried on by that qualifying company. The Issuer confirms that it has not held and does not intend to hold
specified mortgages, units in an IREF (within the meaning of Chapter 1B of Part 27) or shares that derive their
value from, or the greater part of their value from, directly or indirectly, Irish land, for the purposes of Section
110 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (as amended), thus these rules should not apply to this transaction.

**Encashment Tax**

Irish tax will be required to be withheld at a rate of 25% from interest on any Note, where such interest is

collected or realized by a bank or encashment agent in Ireland on behalf of any Noteholder. There is an exemption
from encashment tax where (i) the beneficial owner of the interest is not resident in Ireland and has made a
declaration to this effect in the prescribed form to the encashment agent or bank or (ii) the beneficial owner of the
interest is a company which is within the charge to Irish corporation tax in respect of the interest.

**Stamp Duty**

No stamp duty or similar tax is imposed in Ireland on the issue, transfer or redemption of the Notes

provided the Issuer is a qualifying company for the purposes of Section 110 of the TCA and the proceeds of the
Notes are used in the course of the Issuer’s business.


-----

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

The Issuer, the Guarantors and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, Goldman Sachs International and

Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc (the “Initial Purchasers”) will enter into a purchase agreement to be dated
the date of this Offering Memorandum with respect to the Notes.

The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement, including their agreement to

purchase Notes from the Issuer, are several and not joint.

The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes to purchasers at the price indicated on the cover

page of this Offering Memorandum. The Initial Purchasers may from time to time vary the offering price and any
other selling terms without notice. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell Notes through certain of their
affiliates, who are qualified broker-dealers under applicable law.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept

delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by their counsel
and the Issuer’s counsel. The offering of the Notes by the Initial Purchasers is subject to receipt and acceptance
and subject to the Initial Purchasers’ right to reject any order in whole or in part.

The Issuer has agreed to indemnify the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities

under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments which the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in
respect of any such liabilities. The Issuer will pay the Initial Purchasers a commission and pay certain expenses
of the Offering.

The Issuer and the Parent Guarantor have agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, that during the

period from the date hereof through and including the date that is 45 days after the date hereof (if the sale of the
Notes by the Issuer and the Guarantors to the Initial Purchasers shall have occurred), neither the Parent Guarantor
nor any of its subsidiaries will, without the prior written consent provided for in the purchase agreement, directly
or indirectly, pledge, issue, sell, offer to sell, grant any option for the sale of, or otherwise dispose of any debt
securities issued or guaranteed by the Parent Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries having a maturity of more than
one year from the date of issue (other than the Notes and the Guarantees).

No action has been or will be taken in any jurisdiction by us or the Initial Purchasers that would permit

a public offering of the Notes and the Guarantees, or the possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering
Memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for that purpose is
required. Accordingly, the Notes and the Guarantees may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither
this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may
be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules
and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to
purchase or a solicitation of an offer to sell in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful.
Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about, and to
observe, any restrictions relating to the Offering of the Notes, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and
resales of the Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

The Notes are a new issue of securities with no public trading market. The Issuer has been advised by

the Initial Purchasers that the Initial Purchasers intend to make a market in the Notes but are not obligated to do
so and may discontinue market making at any time without notice. No assurance can be given as to the liquidity
of the trading market for the Notes.

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the date specified

on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be the      business day following the date of
pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle being referred to as “T+   ”.

In connection with the Offering, the Initial Purchasers may purchase and sell the Notes in the open

market. These transactions may include short sales, stabilizing transactions and purchases on the open market to
cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the Initial Purchasers of a greater principal
amount of Notes than they are required to purchase in the Offering. The Initial Purchasers may close out any short
position by purchasing Notes in the open market. A short position is more likely to be created if the Initial
Purchasers are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the Notes in the open market after
pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the Offering.

Similar to other purchase transactions, the Initial Purchasers’ purchases to cover the syndicate short sales

may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of the Notes or preventing or retarding a decline in


-----

the market price of the Notes. As a result, the price of the Notes may be higher than the price that might otherwise
exist in the open market.

Neither we nor any of the Initial Purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or

magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the Notes. In addition,
neither we nor the Initial Purchasers make any representation that these transactions will be engaged in or that
these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.

These activities by the Initial Purchasers, as well as other purchases by the Initial Purchasers for their

own accounts, may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the Notes. As a result, the price of
the Notes may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. If these activities are
commenced, they may be discontinued by the Initial Purchasers at any time. These transactions may be effected
in the over-the-counter market or otherwise.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes, and

other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price
set forth on the cover page hereof.

The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in

various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory,
investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The Initial Purchasers
and their respective affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may in the future perform, various financial
advisory and investment banking services for the Issuer or its affiliates, for which they received or will receive
customary fees and expenses. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates are lenders under the
Senior Facilities, part of which will be prepaid using the proceeds of the Notes. In addition, some of the Initial
Purchasers or their respective affiliates may act as counterparties in any hedging arrangements with us or our
affiliates entered into in connection with the Offering or otherwise, and will receive customary fees for their
services in such capacities.

In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their respective

affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related
derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts
of their customers and may at any time hold long and short positions in such securities and instruments. Such
investment and securities activities may involve securities and instruments of the Issuer.

The Notes (including the Guarantees) have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act,

and may not be offered or sold except to non-U.S. persons in offers and sales that occur outside the United States,
in reliance on Regulation S, and in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any state or territory of the
United States or any other jurisdiction. Accordingly, each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that it has
not offered or sold, and will not offer or sell, any of the Notes (including the Guarantees) as part of its allocation
at any time other than outside of the United States in accordance with Regulation S. Transfer of the Notes
(including the Guarantees) will be restricted and each purchaser of the Notes (including the Guarantees) in the
United States will be required to make certain acknowledgements, representations and agreements, as described
under “Transfer Restrictions.”

In the United Kingdom, this Offering Memorandum is for distribution only to persons who (i) have

professional experience in matters relating to investments falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services
and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005, as amended (the “Financial Promotion Order”), (ii) are
persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (“high net worth companies, unincorporated associations etc.”) of
the Financial Promotion Order, or (iii) are persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment
activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the FSMA) in connection with the issue or sale of any securities may
otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons together being referred to
as “relevant persons”). This Offering Memorandum is directed only at relevant persons and must not be acted on
or relied on by persons who are not relevant persons. Any investment or investment activity to which this Offering
Memorandum relates is available only to relevant persons and will be engaged in only with relevant persons.

Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that:

##### • it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of
section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of the Notes in circumstances
in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer;


-----

##### • it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything
done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom;

##### • it has not offered, sold or otherwise made available and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available
any Notes to any retail investor in the EEA. For the purposes of this provision, the expression “retail
investor” means a person who is one (or more) of the following (i) a retail client as defined in point (11)
of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive,
where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of
MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation; and

##### • it has not offered, sold or otherwise made available and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available
any Notes to any retail investor in the United Kingdom. For the purposes of this paragraph, the expression
“retail investor” means a person who is either (or both) of the following: (i) a retail client, as defined in
point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the
European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the
provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU)
2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article
2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,

sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a
person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU
(as amended, “MiFID II”), (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (as amended), where that
customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II, or (iii) not
a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently no key information document required
by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or
otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling
the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPS
Regulation.

Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of any relevant Initial Purchaser that considers

itself a manufacturer (each a “Manufacturer”), the target market assessment in respect of the Notes described in
this Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible
counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of
the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering,
selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the Manufacturer’s target
market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market
assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the Manufacturer’s target market assessment)
and determining appropriate distribution channels.

Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of the Initial Purchasers that considers itself a

manufacturer pursuant to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK
MiFIR Product Governance Rules”) (the “UK Manufacturer”), the target market assessment in respect of the
securities has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the securities is only eligible counterparties, as
defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook, and professional clients, as defined in Regulation
(EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“UK
MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the securities to eligible counterparties and professional clients
are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the notes (a “UK distributor”) should
take into consideration the UK Manufacturer’s target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the UK
MiFIR Product Governance Rules is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of
the securities (by either adopting or refining the UK Manufacturer’s target market assessment) and determining
appropriate distribution channels.

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

The following restrictions will apply to the Notes. You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to

making any offer, resale, pledge or transfer of the Notes. See “Description of the Notes.”

**General**

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act, or the

securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold except pursuant to
an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and
securities laws of any other applicable jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Notes offered hereby are being offered and
sold only outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under
the Securities Act.

We have not registered and will not register the Notes or the Guarantees under the Securities Act and,

therefore, the Notes may not be offered or sold within the United States or to U.S. persons except pursuant to an
exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Accordingly,
we are offering and selling the Notes to the Initial Purchasers for re-offer and resale only outside the United States
in an offshore transaction in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

We use the terms “offshore transaction,” “U.S. person” and “United States” with the meanings given to

them in Regulation S under the Securities Act.

**Important Information about the Offering**

Each purchaser of Notes, by its acceptance thereof, will be deemed to have acknowledged, represented to and
agreed with the Issuer and Guarantors and the Initial Purchasers as follows:

(1) You understand and acknowledge that the Notes and the Guarantees have not been registered
under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other applicable jurisdiction and that the
Notes are being offered for resale in transactions not requiring registration under the Securities
Act or any other securities laws, and, unless so registered, may not be offered, sold or
otherwise transferred except in compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities
Act or any other applicable securities laws, pursuant to an exemption therefrom or in any
transaction not subject thereto and in each case in compliance with the conditions for transfer
set forth in paragraphs (4) and (5) below.

(2) You are neither the Issuer’s “affiliate” (as defined in the Securities Act), nor acting on its
behalf, and you are a non-U.S. person purchasing the Notes outside the United States in an
offshore transaction in accordance with Regulation S, and, if you are in a member state of the
EEA or the United Kingdom, you are not a retail investor. The expression “retail investor” in
relation to any Member State of the EEA means a person who is one (or more) of the
following: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the
meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97, as amended, (the “IDD”) where that customer would not
qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not
a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation. The expression “retail investor”
in relation to the United Kingdom means a person who is one (or more) of the following: (i) a
retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms
part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; (ii) a customer within the meaning of the
provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made thereunder to implement the IDD,
where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of
Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the
EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the UK Prospectus Regulation.

(3) You acknowledge that neither we, nor any of the Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers, nor any
person representing any of them, has made any representation to you with respect to the Issuer
and its subsidiaries or the offer or sale of any of the Notes, other than the information
contained in this Offering Memorandum, which Offering Memorandum has been delivered to
you and upon which you are relying in making your investment decision with respect to the
Notes. You acknowledge that no person other than the Issuer make any representation or
warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of this Offering Memorandum. You have had
access to such financial and other information concerning us and the Notes as you have
deemed necessary in connection with your decision to purchase any of the Notes, including an
opportunity to ask questions of, and request information from, us and the Initial Purchasers.


-----

(4) You are purchasing the Notes for your own account, or for one or more investor accounts for
which you are acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not with a view
to, or for offer or sale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities
Act or any other applicable securities laws, subject to any requirement of law that the
disposition of your property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all
times within its or their control and subject to your or their ability to resell such Notes
pursuant to Regulation S or any other exemption from registration available under the
Securities Act.

(5) You agree on your own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which you are

**LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND SECURITY**

**INTERESTS AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS**

Set forth below is a summary of certain limitations on the enforceability of the Guarantees and the

security interests in the jurisdiction in which the Guarantees and security interests in the collateral are being, or
are expected to be, provided.

**European Union**

The Issuer and a number of the Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of member states of the

European Union (each, a “Member State”).

On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom voted in favor of withdrawing from the European Union in a

referendum and, on March 29, 2017, the UK Government exercised its right under Article 50 of the Treaty on the
European Union to notify the European Union of the United Kingdom’s intention to withdraw from the European
Union.

There remains considerable uncertainty (and there is likely to be uncertainty for some time to come) as

to the impact the UK’s withdrawal from the EU will have on the regulatory environment in the EU and the United
Kingdom, and on the applicability of EU law in the United Kingdom. In a ‘no deal’ Brexit scenario in particular,
it will likely be harder for UK office holders and UK restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognized
in Member States and to effectively deal with assets located in those other Members States. Much depends upon
the private international rules in the particular Member State and the need may well arise to open parallel
proceedings, increasing the element of risk. In particular, in cases where the appointment of a UK office holder
has been made in reliance on a UK domestic approach, it is much less certain that there will be recognition in the
relevant Member State even if UK jurisdiction is taken on the grounds of UK COMI or establishment (where such
concepts are retained as a matter of UK domestic law). The below guidance as to COMI and any cross-border
proceedings within Europe should be construed as a description of the current law as at the date of this Offering
Memorandum.

Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015

on insolvency proceedings (recast), as amended (the “Recast Insolvency Regulation”), which applies within the
European Union, other than Denmark, to insolvency proceedings opened on or after 26 June 2017 the court which
shall have jurisdiction to open the main insolvency proceedings in relation to a company (subject to certain
exceptions) is the court of the Member State (other than Denmark) in which the relevant company’s center of
main interests (“COMI”) (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation) is situated.

COMI is not a static concept and may change from time to time, but is determined for the purposes of

deciding which court has competent jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings at the time of the request
to open insolvency proceedings: moreover, the determination of where a debtor has its COMI is a question of fact
on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. Article 3(1),
second sentence, of the Recast Insolvency Regulation states that a company’s COMI “shall be the place where the
debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties.”
Under Article 3(1) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation there is, in most cases, a rebuttable presumption that a
corporate debtor has its center of main interests in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the
absence of proof to the contrary. The presumption only applies if the registered office has not been moved to
another Member State within the three month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency
proceedings. Recital 30 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation contains a number of examples of where a
presumption as to COMI may be rebutted: for instance, where the company’s central administration is located in
a Member State other than that of its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant
factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of
management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. In that
respect, the factors that courts may take into consideration when determining the center of main interests of a
debtor can include where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its
business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are established and
where they recognize as being the center of the company’s operations. If the center of main interests of a company
subject to the Recast Insolvency Regulation (a “debtor”), at the time of the request to open insolvency proceedings,
is located in a Member State (other than Denmark), only the courts of that Member State have jurisdiction to open
the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor under the Recast Insolvency Regulation and accordingly
a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in
Annex A to the Recast Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings commenced in one Member State under
the Recast Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized (subject to any public policy exception) in the other


-----

Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency
proceedings may (subject to certain exceptions) be commenced in another Member State (other than Denmark).

If the center of main interests of a debtor, at the time an insolvency application is made, is in a Member

State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member
State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction (subject to certain exceptions) to commence secondary insolvency
proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings against that debtor only if such debtor has an “establishment”
(as defined in Article 2(10) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member State.
Secondary proceedings may be any insolvency proceeding listed in Annex A of the Recast Insolvency Regulation
and for the avoidance of doubt, are not limited to winding-up proceedings. Territorial proceedings are, in effect,
secondary proceedings which are commenced prior to the opening of main insolvency proceedings. An
“establishment” is defined to mean “any place of operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the
three month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity
with human means and assets.” Accordingly, the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial
insolvency proceedings in another Member State (other than Denmark) will also be possible if the debtor had an
establishment in such Member State in the three month period prior to the request for opening of main insolvency
proceedings.

The effects of those secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings opened in

that other Member State (other than Denmark) are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of
such other Member State. Where main proceedings in the Member State (other than Denmark) in which the debtor
has its center of main interests have not yet been commenced, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be
commenced in another Member State (other than Denmark) where the debtor has an establishment where either
(i) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the debtor’s center of main
interests is situated under the conditions laid down by that Member State’s law; or (ii) the opening of territorial
insolvency proceedings is requested by (a) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the
operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the opening of territorial
proceedings is requested, or (b) a public authority which, under the law of the Member State within the territory
of which the establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings. When main
insolvency proceedings are opened, territorial insolvency proceedings become secondary insolvency proceedings.
Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary or territorial insolvency proceedings,
such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the local
insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor.

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment opening insolvency

proceedings of the court commencing proceedings (subject to any public policy exception). The judgment of the
court commencing main proceedings will produce the same effects in the other Member States (other than
Denmark) as under the law of the Member State (other than Denmark) commencing main proceedings, so long as
no secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other
Member State and subject to certain other exceptions (e.g. rights in rem situated in another Member State remain
subject to the original law governing that right). The insolvency practitioner appointed or confirmed by a court in
the Member State which has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on it
by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (other than Denmark) (such as to remove assets of the
debtor from that other Member State). These powers are subject to certain limitations (e.g. the powers are available
provided that no insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State nor any preservation
measure to the contrary has been taken there further to a request to commence secondary proceedings in that other
Member State where the debtor has assets).

In addition, the concept of “group coordination proceedings” has been introduced in the Recast

Insolvency Regulation with the aim of bolstering communication and efficiency in the insolvency proceedings of
several members of a group of companies opened in one or more Member States (other than Denmark). Under
Article 61 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, group coordination proceedings may be requested before any
court having jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of a member of the group, by an insolvency practitioner
appointed in insolvency proceedings opened in relation to a member of the group. Participation in group
coordination proceedings and adherence to the coordinating insolvency practitioner’s recommendations or plan
however is voluntary.

In the event that any one or more of the Issuer or the Guarantors experience financial difficulty, it is not

possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would
be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable laws may affect the enforceability of the
obligations and the security of the Issuer and/or any of the Guarantors (as applicable).

**England and Wales**

eircom (UK) Limited (the “English Obligor”) is a company incorporated under the laws of England and

Wales and is subject to certain English law Collateral.

English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which

investors may be familiar. The obligations under the Notes will be secured by security interests over the collateral,
including over substantially all of the English Obligor’s assets other than: (i) certain leasehold properties located
in Northern Ireland and England; (ii) a general authorization to provide telecommunications services in the United
Kingdom through the Office of Communications and related rights of use for numbers; and (iii) eircom (UK)
Limited’s interests in certain agreements with third parties relating to procurement of telecommunications services
and the provision of education network services. English insolvency laws, as they apply to the English Obligor
and any English law collateral, and other limitations imposed by English insolvency laws could limit the
enforceability of those security interests over the collateral and the enforceability of any guarantees granted which
are governed by English law.

Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and Wales may be initiated in a number of ways,

including by the company or a creditor making an application for administration in court, the company or the
holder of a “qualifying floating charge” in respect of the company’s property (discussed below) making an
application for administration out of court, or by a creditor filing a petition to wind up the company or the company
resolving to do so (in the case of a liquidation).

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to certain

limitations on the guarantees and security interests granted over the collateral. The application of these laws could
adversely affect investors, including their ability to enforce their rights under the collateral securing the Notes and
may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an English law insolvency of an English Obligor. A summary
of these processes is set out below.

**_Formal Insolvency Processes_**

Under the Insolvency Act, certain types of company may file for or become subject to certain formal

insolvency processes. Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and Wales include administration
and liquidation,

The distinction between administration and liquidation is discussed further below but, in essence,

administration is designed to provide a tool to rescue the company or its business as a going concern where the
company is or is likely to become insolvent, whereas liquidation is a termination procedure designed to distribute
the company’s assets to its creditors.

In addition to administration and liquidation, there are two other insolvency regimes under the Insolvency

Act, namely company voluntary arrangements and administrative receivership. Certain secured creditors may also
have the ability to appoint a receiver (in contrast to an administrative receiver) which is a self-help remedy often
granted within the documents granting the security interests over the collateral. Save for receivership and
administrative receivership, all of these insolvency procedures under the Insolvency Act are collective remedies
for the benefit of all creditors.

**_Administration_**

Under the Insolvency Act, it is possible for a qualified insolvency practitioner to be appointed as an

administrator of (i) a company registered under the Companies Act 2006 in England and Wales or Scotland, (ii)
a company incorporated in a member state of the European Economic Area or (iii) a company not incorporated in
a member state of the European Economic Area but having its COMI in an EU member state (other than Denmark)
or in the UK. A court order is not necessarily required for such an appointment.

Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, a court order appointing an administrator can be made

if the court is satisfied that (a) the relevant company is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts” (although
this requirement does not apply if the applicant is a holder of a “qualifying floating charge” in respect of the
company’s property (see “—Qualifying Floating Charge” as to what constitutes a qualifying floating charge in


-----

respect of the company’s property)) and (b) the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the stated
purpose of the administration.

A company is unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (unable to pay its debts as

they fall due) or if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (the value of the company’s assets is less than the
amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities), as per Section 123 of the
Insolvency Act. Such insolvency is presumed if, among other matters, the company fails either to satisfy a
creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 within 21 days of service or to satisfy in full or in part a
judgment debt (or similar court order).

Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, a company, the directors of such company or the

holder of a qualifying floating charge in respect of the company’s property (see “—Qualifying Floating Charge”
as to what constitutes a qualifying floating charge in respect of the company’s property) where the floating charge
has become enforceable, may also appoint an administrator via an out of court process, and different procedures
apply according to the identity of the appointor. If the appointor holds a qualifying floating charge in respect of
the company’s property, there is no requirement that the company is or is likely to become unable to pay its debts.

The administration of a company must achieve one of the following statutory objectives: (1) the rescue of

the company (as distinct from the business carried on by the company) as a going concern (the first objective); (2)
the achievement of a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole than would be likely if the company
were wound up (without first being in administration) (the second objective); or (3) the realization of some or all
of the company’s property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors (the third
objective). An administrator must attempt to achieve the first objective of administration, unless he or she thinks
either that it is not reasonably practicable to achieve the first objective, or that the second objective would achieve
a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole. The administrator cannot pursue the third objective unless
he or she thinks that it is not reasonably practicable to achieve either the first objective or the second objective
and that it will not unnecessarily harm the interests of the creditors of the company as a whole to pursue the third
objective. Subject to this, the administrator must perform his or her functions in the interests of the company’s
creditors as a whole. The order of priority which applies to any distribution to creditors is set out below (see “—
_Priority of Claims”)._

Certain rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are curtailed in an administration pursuant to the

statutory moratorium imposed under the Insolvency Act. For example, upon the appointment of an administrator,
no step may be taken to enforce security over the company’s property except with the consent of the administrator
or leave of the court. The same requirements for consent or permission apply to the institution or continuation of
legal process (including legal proceedings, execution, distress and diligence) against the company or property of
the company. In either case, a court will consider a range of discretionary factors in determining any application
for leave in light of the hierarchy of statutory objectives of administration described above.

Accordingly, if the English Obligor were to enter administration, the collateral granted by that English

Obligor could not be enforced while that English Obligor was in administration without the leave of the court or
consent of the administrator. There can be no assurance that such leave of the court or consent of the administrator
would be obtained.

However, while the restrictions of the statutory moratorium are extensive they are not total. For example,

contractual set-off rights may continue to be exercised, at least until the administrator makes an authorized
distribution. In addition, certain creditors of a company in administration may, in certain defined circumstances,
be able to enforce their security over certain of that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium.
This is by virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to “any security interest created or otherwise
arising under a financial collateral arrangement” (generally, this can include a charge over cash or financial
instruments, such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments and credit claims) under the
Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/3226) (as amended) (the “Financial
Collateral Regulations”) (see “—Financial Collateral Regulations”). If an English Obligor were to enter
administration, it is possible that, to the extent such security is not a financial collateral arrangement, the security
granted by it would not be able to be enforced while it is in administration without leave of the court or consent
of the administrators.


-----

While an administrator is in office, the powers of the directors of the relevant company cease (save for

those powers that do not interfere with the exercise of the administrator’s powers, or where permitted by the
administrator) and the administrator has primary responsibility for managing the company’s affairs. An
administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business of the company to which he or she is appointed and,
subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company in administration
that is either not subject to security, or is subject to a floating charge. In the case of property subject to a fixed
charge, an administrator has no power to dispose of that property clear of the fixed charge without the agreement
of the relevant charge holder or a court order. Such a court order is discretionary and may be made only where the
court thinks the disposal would be likely to promote the purpose of administration. If such an order is made, it
will be conditional upon the administrator applying the net proceeds of the disposal, together with any additional
sum required to produce the net amount the court determines would be realized on a sale at a market value, towards
discharging the sums secured by the fixed charge. The administrator also has the ability to challenge certain
antecedent transactions.

Ordinary corporate administration terminates automatically after a year (albeit the administration may be

extended by court order or, subject to a limit of one year, by consent of the creditors).

A company may exit administration and control will be restored to its directors in certain cases, including

if the administrator is satisfied that the purpose of administration has been sufficiently achieved (upon application
to and order of the court if the administration is pursuant to an administration order). However, it is also possible
for a company to move from administration to liquidation or dissolution. The administrator has the power to
present a winding up petition and, if he or she thinks the purpose of administration cannot be achieved, he or she
must apply to court to end his or her appointment. In addition, a company in administration can move to creditors’
voluntary liquidation (where the administrator thinks that all secured creditors will be paid and there is at least
something remaining available for the unsecured creditors) or dissolution (where the administrator thinks that
there is no property available for distribution to the creditors).

**_Qualifying Floating Charge_**

Where certain companies (see the first paragraph of “—Administration”) grant security constituting a “qualifying
floating charge” in respect of such company’s property to a party, that party may be able to appoint an
administrative receiver (see “—Administrative Receivership and Receivership”) or an administrator out of court
(see “—Administration”).

In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge in respect of the company’s property, the floating charge

must be created by an instrument which: (a) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it; (b) purports
to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company; or (c) purports to empower the holder to
appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by Section 29(2) of the Insolvency Act. A party will
be the holder of a qualifying floating charge in respect of the company’s property if he holds one or more
debentures of the company secured: (a) by a qualifying floating charge which relates to the whole or substantially
the whole of the company’s property; (b) by a number of qualifying floating charges which together relate to the
whole or substantially the whole of the company’s property; or (c) by charges and other forms of security which
together relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the company’s property and at least one of which is a
qualifying floating charge. It is a matter of fact whether the relevant security relates to ‘the whole or substantially
the whole’ of the company’s property and there is no statutory guidance as to what percentage of a company’s
assets should be charged to satisfy this test.

**_Administrative Receivership and Receivership_**

There are, broadly speaking, two different types of receiver: an ‘administrative receiver’ (being a receiver

or manager of the whole or substantially the whole of a company’s property appointed by a holder of a charge
which, as created, was a floating charge, or by such a charge and one or more other securities and who normally
takes over the running of the company’s business) and a receiver (often described as a “fixed charge receiver”).
The latter are not administrative receivers and are mostly used to sell land or other specific assets subject to a
fixed charge.


-----

Administrative receivership as a creditor remedy has been largely abolished and is only available in very

limited circumstances. The ability to appoint an administrative receiver only applies to holders of a qualifying
floating charge in respect of the company’s property (see “—Qualifying Floating Charge”) where such charge
pre-dates 15 September 2003 or falls within one of the exceptions under the Insolvency Act to the prohibition on
the appointment of administrative receivers. The most relevant exception relates to “capital market arrangements”
(as defined in the Insolvency Act), which may apply if the issue of the Notes creates a debt of at least £50.0 million
for the relevant English company during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a
“capital market investment” (which is defined in the Insolvency Act, and includes rated, listed or traded debt
instruments, and debt instruments designed to be rated, listed or traded). If these requirements cannot be satisfied,
the charge holder may not appoint an administrative receiver.

The ability to appoint a receiver over secured assets (in contrast to an administrative receiver) is typically

provided for in English law security documents. There is also a (limited) statutory right under Section 101 of the
Law of Property Act 1925 for the holder of a mortgage or charge created by deed over the assets of a chargor to
appoint a receiver over the charged assets to collect the income of the charged property and apply it in satisfaction
of the secured debt.

A receiver can be appointed in accordance with the terms of the security documentation which typically

provide for the ability to appoint a receiver once the relevant security interests become enforceable in accordance
with their terms. Once appointed, the receiver acts as the agent of the chargor. The charge document pursuant to
which the receiver is appointed will typically set out the powers of the receiver once appointed. Typically, these
powers will include the right to take possession of and sell the charged assets, with the proceeds being used to pay
the relevant secured creditors.

An administrative receiver’s and, typically, a receiver’s primary duty is to realize the secured assets and to

pay the proceeds to the appointer, up to the amount of the secured debt (subject to the requirement to set aside the
prescribed part (see “—Prescribed Part”)). An administrative receiver or receiver does, however, also owe duties
to the chargor, in particular a duty if selling a secured asset to take reasonable care to obtain the best price
reasonably obtainable at the time of sale.

There is no moratorium in receivership or administrative receivership, so creditors can enforce any rights

that are consistent with the priority of the security, including exercising rights of set-off and forfeiture, collecting
goods that are subject to valid retention of title claims and, subject to certain Insolvency Act limitations on the
effectiveness of ipso facto clauses where applicable, terminating contracts.

If a company is already in administration, the moratorium on creditor action will prevent the appointment

of a receiver or administrative receiver unless (in the case of a receiver) the administrator consents or the court
permits the appointment, or an exception to the moratorium applies (see above).

If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and

not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge in respect of the company’s property
using the out of court procedure) and then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents
or the court considers that the security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of
challenge as a transaction at an undervalue, a preference or an invalid floating charge. In contrast, the appointment
of a receiver who is not an administrative receiver does not prevent the appointment of an administrator.

If an administrator is appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate office, and any receiver appointed

over part of the company’s property must resign if required to do so by the administrator unless that receiver was
appointed under a charge created or otherwise arising under a financial collateral arrangement, as per Reg. 8(4)
of the Financial Collateral Regulations.

**_Liquidation_**

Liquidation is a company dissolution procedure pursuant to which the assets of the company are realized

and distributed by the liquidator to creditors in the statutory order of priority prescribed by the Insolvency Act
(see “—Priority of Claims”). Once the liquidator has completed this task, the company will be dissolved and
removed from the register of companies.


-----

There are two forms of winding up: (a) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court; and (b) voluntary

liquidation, by resolution of the company’s members, and which is in turn divided into members’ voluntary
liquidation (“MVL”) and creditors’ voluntary liquidation (“CVL”), in each case by resolution of the company’s
members. Note that while a CVL (other than as an exit from administration) is initiated by a resolution of the
members, not the creditors, once in place it is subject to some degree of control by the creditors.

Companies registered in England and Wales or foreign companies with their COMI in England and Wales,

with their COMI in an EU member state (other than Denmark) and an “establishment” in England and Wales or
which have a “sufficient connection” with England and Wales to justify the court exercising its jurisdiction may
be wound up via compulsory liquidation. Only companies registered in England and Wales may be subject to
voluntary liquidation (save that a foreign company where its COMI is in England and Wales or in an EU member
state (except Denmark) but which has an “establishment” in England and Wales may enter a creditors’ voluntary
liquidation).

A creditor, the company or in certain circumstances a shareholder, among others, can present a winding
up petition to the Court for the compulsory winding-up of a company. The most common grounds for the
compulsory winding up of a company is that either it is unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the
Insolvency Act) or the court is of the opinion that it is just and equitable for the company to be wound up.

The effect of a compulsory liquidation differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary liquidation.

In a compulsory liquidation, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act, any disposition of the relevant company’s
property made after the commencement of the winding up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. However, this
will not apply to any property or security interest subject to a disposition or created or otherwise arising under a
financial collateral arrangement under the Financial Collateral Regulations and will not prevent a close-out netting
provision taking effect in accordance with its terms. Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made for the
winding-up of a company by the court, it is deemed to have commenced from the time of the presentation of the
winding up petition. Once a winding up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company
will be imposed. No action or proceeding may be continued or commenced against the company without
permission of the court and subject to such terms as the court may impose although there is no stay on the
enforcement of security.

In the context of a voluntary liquidation, however, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a

winding-up order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the members’ resolution to wind up. As a result,
there is no equivalent of Section 127 of the Insolvency Act. There is also no automatic stay in the case of a
voluntary liquidation – it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or contributory of the company, to apply for a stay
to prevent the continuation of legal proceedings and enforcement of security.

An MVL is a solvent liquidation that is controlled by the shareholders. It commences when the shareholders

pass a special resolution to place the company into liquidation and there is no involvement by the court. Not more
than five weeks prior to the making of the winding up resolution, the directors must swear a statutory declaration
of solvency stating that, after having made full enquiry into the company’s affairs, they have formed the opinion
that it will be able to pay its debts, including interest and the costs of the MVL process in full, within a stated
period not exceeding twelve months from the start of the liquidation.

A CVL is also commenced by the shareholders resolving to place the company into liquidation and has no

court involvement. In contrast to an MVL, however, the directors do not swear a statutory declaration of solvency
for a CVL (meaning the company can be solvent or insolvent). If the creditors choose a different person to act as
liquidator from that appointed by the shareholders, the creditors’ choice will prevail.

On the appointment of a liquidator, the directors’ powers to bind the company automatically cease, save

for those powers that are sanctioned by the liquidator or creditors (as appropriate). A liquidator has, among other
things, the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry on the business of the
company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up, to sell the company’s property (provided that in
respect of the sale of any property that is secured by a fixed charge in favor of a creditor, if that sale is made
without the secured creditor’s consent, it will be made subject to that security, as the creditor’s consent will be
needed to the release of the security), execute documents in the name of the company and to challenge antecedent
transactions.


-----

Under English insolvency law, with some exceptions a liquidator has the power to disclaim any onerous

property, which includes unprofitable contracts and any other property of the company that cannot be sold, readily
sold or may give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act. A contract may be unprofitable
if it gives rise to prospective liabilities and imposes continuing financial obligations on the company that may be
detrimental to creditors. However, this power does not apply to a contract where all of the obligations have been
performed nor can it be used to disturb accrued rights and liabilities, and if a contract is disclaimed the contractual
counterparty has a right to sue for damages in respect of the terminated contract.

**_Company Voluntary Arrangements_**

A company voluntary arrangement (“CVA”) is a procedure intended to allow companies to avoid

potentially terminal insolvency proceedings and to address their financial difficulties by obtaining a binding
agreement or compromise with their unsecured creditors. Though it does not result in the insolvency of a company,
a CVA is implemented under the supervision of an insolvency practitioner who will act as the “nominee” before
the CVA proposals are approved, and as the “supervisor” afterwards. CVAs may also be used as a tool alongside
a formal insolvency procedure such as administration in order to implement a compromise between the debtor
company and its creditors. Unlike an administration proceeding, a CVA does not automatically trigger a
moratorium of claims or proceedings.

A company is eligible to propose a CVA if it is (i) registered under the Companies Act 2006 in England

and Wales or Scotland (ii) incorporated in a member state of the European Economic Area or (iii) not incorporated
in a member state of the European Economic Area but has its COMI in a member state of the EU (other than
Denmark) or in the UK. The CVA can be proposed by the relevant company’s directors (if the relevant company
is not in administration or liquidation) or, if the relevant company is in administration or liquidation, by the
administrator or the liquidator (as applicable).

The proposal for a CVA would generally include a rescheduling or reduction of the company's unsecured

debts, but may also form part of more complex arrangements that seek to balance the interests of many different
creditor groups.

If the proposals under the CVA are approved by the requisite majority of creditors (i.e. 75% or more in

value of creditors who respond in the decision procedure) and provided that those voting against the proposal do
not include more than 50% in value of creditors who are unconnected with the company whose claims are admitted
for voting, a CVA will bind all unsecured creditors of a company who were entitled to vote on the proposal or
who would have been entitled to vote if they had notice of the decision procedure. However, a CVA will not affect
the rights of secured creditors or preferential creditors unless they agree to the proposals. A wholly-secured
creditor is excluded from CVA voting, but if the debt owed to a creditor is partly secured that creditor is permitted
to vote in respect of the unsecured part of its debt. Shareholders of the company will also be asked to vote on the
CVA but whether or not they vote in favor, the CVA will be implemented if the requisite majority of creditors
approve the proposal.

**_Avoidance of Transactions_**

There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by a company of security and

guarantees, or the entry by a company into a transaction can be challenged. In most cases, this will only arise if
the company is placed into administration or liquidation within a specified period from the relevant act. Therefore,
if during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is appointed to a company, the administrator or
liquidator may challenge the validity of the security or guarantee given, or certain transactions entered into by that
company and, as such, it cannot be certain that, in the event that the onset of a company’s insolvency (as described
below) is within any of the requisite time periods, the grant of a security interest or a guarantee in respect of the
Notes would not be challenged or that a court would uphold the transaction as valid.

**_Relevant Time_**

Whether a transaction at an undervalue was entered into, a preference was given or an invalid floating

charge was granted will depend in part on whether that action took place at the “relevant time.”

In the case of a preference or a transaction at an undervalue, the relevant time is deemed to be:


-----

a) if the preference was in favor of a connected person (other than solely by reason of being an employee

of the company), and in the case of all transactions at an undervalue, the period of two years ending
with the onset of the company’s insolvency (as defined below);

b) if the preference is not given in favor of a connected person, the period of six months ending with the

onset of the company’s insolvency;

c) in either case, at a time between the making of an administration application in respect of the company

and the making of an administration order on that application; or

d) in either case, at a time between the filing of a notice of intention to appoint an administrator and the

making of an appointment,

e) provided that where a company enters into a transaction at an undervalue or gives a preference at a

time mentioned in a) or b) above, that time is not a “relevant time” unless the company was unable
to pay its debts or the company became unable to pay its debts as a result of the transaction at an
undervalue or the transaction in respect of which the preference was given. If the transaction at an
undervalue is entered into in favor of a connected party, there will be a presumption of insolvency
and the connected person must demonstrate that the company was not unable to pay its debts at the
time of the transaction or became unable to do so as a consequence of the transaction.

In the case of a floating charge which is being challenged, the relevant time is deemed to be:

a) if the floating charge is created in favor of a connected person, the period of two years ending with

the onset of the company’s insolvency (as defined below);

b) if the charge is not created in favor of a connected person, the period of 12 months ending with the

onset of the company’s insolvency;

c) in either case, at a time between the making of an administration application in respect of the company

and the making of an administration order on that application; or

d) in either case, at a time between the filing of a notice of intention to appoint an administrator and the

making of an appointment,

e) provided that at the time the charge was granted the company was unable to pay its debts or became

unable to pay its debts as a consequence of the transaction in respect of which the floating charge was
granted.

The date of the onset of insolvency, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and

invalid floating charges (as discussed below), depends on the insolvency procedure in question.

In administration, the “onset of insolvency” is the date on which: (a) the court application for an

administration order is issued; (b) the notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court; or (c)
otherwise, the date on which the appointment of an administrator takes effect.

In a compulsory liquidation the “onset of insolvency” is the date the winding up petition is presented to

court, whereas in a voluntary liquidation it is the date the company passes a winding up resolution. Where
liquidation follows administration, the onset of insolvency will be the same as the initial administration.

**_Connected Persons_**

If the given transaction at an undervalue, preference, or invalid floating charge has been entered into by

the company with a “connected person”, then particular specified time periods and presumptions will apply to any
challenge by an administrator or liquidator (as set out below).

A “connected person” of a company granting a security interest or guarantee for the purposes of

transactions at an undervalue, preferences or invalid floating charges is a party who is: (a) a director of the
company; (b) a shadow director; (c) an associate of such director or shadow director; or (d) an associate of the
relevant company.


-----

The term “associate” is very widely defined; key “associates” are defined below (as set out in Section 435

of the Insolvency Act).

A party is an associate of an individual if they are: (a) a relative of the individual; (b) the individual’s

husband, wife or civil partner; (c) a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner; (d) the husband,
wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual; or (e) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the
individual’s husband, wife or civil partner.

A person is an associate of any person with whom he is in partnership and of the husband, wife or civil

partner or relative of any individual with whom he is in partnership.

A party is associated with a company if they are employed by that company (and in this case directors of

a company are treated as employees of that company). A person is also an associate of any person whom he
employs. A company is an associate of another person if that person has control of it or if that person and persons
who are his associates together have control of it.

A company is associated with another company if the same person has control of both companies, or a

person has control of one and persons who are his associates, or he and persons who are his associates, have
control of the other, or if a group of two or more persons has control of each company, and the groups either
consist of the same persons or could be regarded as consisting of the same persons by treating (in one or more
cases) a member of either group as replaced by a person of whom he is an associate.

A person is to be taken as having control of a company if the directors of the company or of another

company which has control of it (or any of them) are accustomed to act in accordance with his directions or
instructions, or he is entitled to exercise, or control the exercise of, one third or more of the voting power at any
general meeting of the company or of another company which has control of it. Where two or more persons
together satisfy either of these conditions, they are to be taken as having control of the company.

The potential grounds for challenge available under English law that may apply to any security interest or

guarantee granted by a company include, without limitation, the following described below.

**_Transaction at an Undervalue_**

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator could apply to the court for an order to set

aside a security interest or a guarantee (or grant other relief) where the creation of such security interest or
guarantee constituted a transaction at an undervalue under Section 238 of the Insolvency Act. A transaction will
only be a transaction at an undervalue if at the time of the transaction or as a consequence of the transaction, the
company was or became unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act).

A transaction may be set aside as a transaction at an undervalue if the company made a gift to a person, if

the company received no consideration, or if the company received consideration of significantly less value, in
money or money’s worth, than the consideration given by such company in return. In any proceedings, it is for
the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the company was insolvent unless a beneficiary of the
transaction was a connected person (see “—Connected Persons”), in which case there is a presumption of
insolvency and the connected person must demonstrate the solvency of the company in such proceedings. The
transaction must also have occurred at the “relevant time” (see “—Relevant Time”).

A court will not generally set aside a transaction if it is satisfied that the company entered into the

transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were
reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit the company. If the court determines that the
transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court shall make such order as it thinks fit to restore the
company to the position it would have been in had the transaction not been entered into (which may include the
setting aside of any security interests or guarantees granted). An order by the court for a transaction at an
undervalue may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not he is the person
with whom the company entered into the transaction, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property
which was acquired from a person other than the company in good faith and for value, or prejudice any interest
deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good


-----

faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where that person was
a party to the transaction.

**_Preference_**

Under the Insolvency Act, a liquidator or administrator could apply to the court for an order to set aside

the creation of a security interest or a guarantee (or grant other relief) where the creation of such security interest
or such guarantee constituted a preference under Section 239 of the Insolvency Act. A transaction will only
constitute a preference if at the time of the transaction or as a consequence of the transaction the company was or
became unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act).

A transaction may constitute a preference if it has the effect of putting a creditor of the company (or an

existing surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better position (in the event of the
company going into insolvent liquidation) than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in
had that transaction not been entered into. For the court to determine a preference, however, it must be shown
that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect (under Section 239(5) of the
Insolvency Act). The transaction must also have occurred at a “relevant time” (see “—Relevant Time” above).

It is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the company was insolvent at the time and that

the company was influenced by a desire to prefer the counterparty to the transaction, unless the beneficiary of the
transaction was a connected person (other than solely by reason of being an employee of the company), in which
case there is a presumption that the company was influenced by a desire to prefer and the connected person must
demonstrate in such proceedings that the company was not so influenced . The desire to prefer requires a “positive
wish to improve the creditor’s position in the event of the company’s insolvent liquidation” (Re Fairway
_Magazines Ltd 1993 BCLC 643). A preferential effect for a creditor may be foreseen by the company without_
being desired. Where a company is influenced only by “proper commercial considerations” there will be no desire
to prefer and therefore no voidable preference (Re MC Bacon Ltd (No. 1) 1990 BCLC 324).

If the court determines that the transaction was a preference, the court has very wide powers for restoring

the position to what it would have been if that preference had not been given, which could include reducing
payments under or setting aside the relevant Notes, Guarantees and collateral (although there is certain protection
(described below) for a third party who enters into a transaction in good faith and without notice). An order by
the court for a preference may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not he
is the person to whom the preference was given, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which
was acquired from a person other than the company in good faith and for value, or prejudice any interest deriving
from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the preference in good faith and
for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where that person was a party to
the transaction constituting a preference or where the payment is to be in respect of a preference given to that
person at a time when he was a creditor of the company.

**_Transaction Defrauding Creditors_**

Under the Insolvency Act, where it can be shown that a transaction was at an undervalue and the court is

satisfied that it was made for the purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may
make, a claim against a company, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of a person in relation to the claim that
that person is making or may make, the transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction defrauding
creditors. This provision may be used by the relevant company’s liquidator or administrator or (with the leave of
the court if the company is in administration or liquidation) any person who claims to be a “victim” of the
transaction and, subject to certain conditions, the UK Financial Conduct Authority, the UK Prudential Regulation
Authority and the UK Pensions Regulator. There is no statutory time limit under English insolvency legislation
within which the challenge must be made (subject to the normal statutory limitation periods) and the relevant
company does not need to be insolvent at the time of, or as a result of, the transaction.

If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make such

orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into
and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction. The relevant court order may affect the property of,
or impose any obligation on, any person, whether or not he is the person with whom the transaction was entered


-----

into. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other
than the debtor company in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, and will not
require a person who received a benefit from such transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the
relevant circumstances to pay any sum unless such person was a party to the transaction.

**_Extortionate Credit Transaction_**

An administrator or a liquidator can apply to court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction. The court

can review extortionate credit transactions entered into by a company up to three years before the day on which
the company entered into administration or went into liquidation. A transaction is extortionate if, having regard
to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, the terms of it are (or were) such as to require grossly
exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision
of the credit or it otherwise grossly contravened ordinary principles of fair dealing. It is presumed, unless otherwise
proved by the person extending the credit, that a transaction with respect to which an administrator or liquidator
makes an application to set aside an extortionate credit transaction is extortionate. The court can make an order
in relation to extortionate credit transactions entered into by a company up to three years before the day on which
a company entered into administration or went into liquidation. That order may set aside, either in whole or in
part, any obligation created by the transaction (which could include obligations of sureties). It may also vary the
terms of the transaction or the terms of any security for the purposes of the transaction. The court may require any
party to the transaction to repay to the liquidator or administrator sums already paid under the transaction and it
may order the surrender of any security held for the purpose of the transaction. It should be noted that there are
no provisions for the protection of third parties who acquire interests in the extortionate credit transaction (e.g.
assignees of the benefit of the transaction from the person who provided credit under it).

**_Invalid Floating Charges_**

The Insolvency Act provides that, in certain circumstances, a floating charge granted by a company during

the “relevant time” (see “—Relevant Time”) may be invalid in whole or in part if certain conditions are met.
Nevertheless, even if a floating charge is prima facie invalid, it will be valid to the extent of the aggregate of:

a) the value of so much of the consideration for the creation of the charge as consists of money paid, or

goods or services supplied, to the company at the same time as, or after, the creation of the charge;

b) the value of so much of that consideration as consists of the discharge or reduction, at the same time as,

or after, the creation of the charge, of any debt of the company; and

c) interest on any such amount.

Further, the power to avoid a floating charge under Section 245 of the Insolvency Act is disapplied in

respect of a floating charge created or otherwise arising under a security financial collateral arrangement (as
defined in the Financial Collateral Regulations).

If a floating charge is held to be wholly invalid, then it will not be possible for the holder of that charge to

appoint an administrator out-of-court or through the less onerous in-court route for a holder of a qualifying floating
charge in respect of the company’s property or (if the holder would otherwise have been entitled to appoint an
administrative receiver but for the floating charge being held invalid), to appoint an administrative receiver.

**_Limitation on Enforcement_**

The grant of a guarantee or security by an English company in respect of the obligations of another

company must satisfy certain legal requirements. Among other requirements, such a transaction must be allowed
by the respective company’s articles of association. To the extent that these documents do not allow such an
action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee and/or security can be found to be void and the respective
creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with an English
company in good faith; however, the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation.

Further, corporate benefit must be established for the company in question by virtue of entering into the

proposed transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director of a company must act in
the way that he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of that company for the


-----

benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors authorize the company’s entry into a transaction where there is
no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found to be abusing their powers as directors and such a
transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court. Section 172(3) of the Companies Act 2006 additionally
provides that a director’s general duty (as described above) is subject to any enactment or rule of law requiring
directors, in certain circumstances, to consider or act in the interests of the creditors of the company. While the
statutory provisions do not specify the circumstances in which the requirement to consider or act in the interests
of the creditors of the company arises, the UK Supreme Court has held that when an English company is insolvent
or bordering on insolvency, its directors owe a duty to the company to consider the interests of the company’s
creditors as a whole and, if an insolvent liquidation or administration is not inevitable, balance those interests
against the interests of shareholders.

Security and/or guarantees granted by an English Obligor may also be subject to potential limitations to

the extent they would result in unlawful financial assistance contrary to English company law.

_Security Registration_

Under English company law, subject to limited exceptions, a certified copy of any security document

pursuant to which a charging company incorporated in England and Wales grants security (including security
governed by law other than English law) (together with prescribed particulars of the relevant security) should be
delivered to the Registrar of Companies for registration within 21 days after the date of creation of the relevant
security interest (the “Registration Period”). While the Companies Act 2006 does not impose an obligation as
such to register security, security will be deemed to be void against a liquidator, administrator and any creditor of
the applicable charging company if not registered within the Registration Period. When security becomes so void,
the debt which was intended to be secured by such security is deemed to become immediately payable. In limited
circumstances, it may be possible to apply to the English courts for an order to rectify a failure to register and
allow the relevant charge to be registered after the Registration Period has expired.

The Financial Collateral Regulations exempt certain charges over financial collateral from registration with

the Registrar of Companies. Security created by overseas companies over assets in England and Wales similarly
does not need to be registered with the Registrar of Companies, although registration with applicable asset
registries may still be required depending on the nature of the collateral assets.

**_Priority of Claims_**

One of the primary functions of liquidation (and, where the company cannot be rescued as a going concern,

one of the possible functions of administration) under English law is to realize the assets of the insolvent company
and to distribute the cash realizations made from those assets to its creditors. Under the Insolvency Act, creditors
are placed into different classes and, with the exceptions and adjustments noted below, the proceeds from the
realization of the insolvent company’s property applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. With the
exception of the prescribed part (see “—Prescribed Part”), distributions generally cannot be made to a class of
creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior ranking class have been repaid in full. Unless creditors have
agreed otherwise, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the cash is distributed in proportion to the
debts due to each creditor within a class.

The general priority of claims on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority) and subject to

certain circumstances in which super priority is afforded to moratorium debts and priority pre-moratorium debts
in accordance with Section 174A of the Insolvency Act and paragraph 64A of Schedule B1 of the Insolvency Act
(see “—Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020”):

  - **First ranking: holders of fixed charge security, who are entitled to the proceeds of those secured assets**
up to the value of their secured claim, and creditors with a proprietary interest in specific assets in the
possession (but not full legal and beneficial ownership) of the debtor are entitled to the assets in which
they have a proprietary interest;

  - **Second ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate incurred during the relevant insolvency proceedings**
(there is a further statutory order of priority setting out the order in which expenses are paid);

  - **Third ranking: preferential creditors.**


-----

Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in
relation to: (i) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (ii) wages and salaries of
employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per
person; and (iii) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the
termination takes place before or after the insolvency date; and (iv) bank and building deposits eligible
for compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (“FSCS”) up to the statutory limit.
As between one another, ordinary preferential debts rank equally.

Secondary preferential debts rank for payment after the discharge of ordinary preferential debts and
include (a) bank and building deposits eligible for compensation under the FSCS to the extent that claims
exceed the statutory limit, and (b) with respect to all insolvencies commencing on or after 1 December
2020, claims by HM Revenue and Customs in respect of certain taxes including VAT, PAYE income
tax, employee NI contributions and Construction Industry Scheme deductions but excluding corporation
tax and employers’ NI contributions which are held by the company on behalf of employees and
customers, and in each case rank for payment after the discharge of the ordinary preferential debts. As
between one another, secondary preferential debts rank equally;

  - **Fourth ranking: holders of floating charge security to the extent of the realizations from those secured**
assets, according to the priority of their security. This would include any security interest that was stated
to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but which, on a proper interpretation, was rendered a
floating charge (see “—Recharacterization of fixed security interests”). However, before distributing
asset realizations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part (as defined below) must, subject
to certain exceptions, be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors;

  - **Fifth ranking:**

      - first, provable debts of unsecured creditors and any secured creditor to the extent of any
unsecured shortfall, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the
date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. In the case of any unsecured
shortfall for secured creditors, the insolvency officeholder can only use realizations from
unsecured assets and is not permitted to make a distribution from the Prescribed Part (as defined
below) to such secured creditors unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to first pay out all
unsecured creditors;

      - secondly, interest on the company’s debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and
the rate determined in accordance with the Judgments Act 1838 (currently 8% per annum)) in
respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation, or after the commencement of any
administration which had been converted into a distributing administration. However, in the
case of interest accruing on amounts due under the Notes or the Guarantees, such interest due
to the holders of the Notes may, if there are sufficient realizations from the secured assets, be
discharged out of such security recoveries; and

      - thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories
above and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully
paid; and

  - **Sixth Ranking: shareholders. If after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining**
funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company.

Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the

subordination language in the relevant documentation (and provided that such terms do not contravene the
Insolvency Act).

**_Prescribed Part_**

An administrator, receiver (including administrative receiver) or liquidator of the company will be required

to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of assets subject to a charge which was a floating
charge on its creation for the benefit of unsecured creditors (after making full provision for preferential creditors


-----

and expenses out of floating charge realizations and subject to the exception for financial collateral arrangements)
(the “Prescribed Part”). The amount of the Prescribed Part is 50% of the first £10,000 of net floating charge
realizations plus 20% of the remainder over £10,000, subject to an aggregate cap of £800,000 (or £600,000 in the
case of a floating charge created before 6 April 2020). The Prescribed Part must be made available to unsecured
creditors unless the cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors. The Prescribed
Part will not be available for any shortfall claims of secured creditors unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to
first pay out all unsecured creditors.

The requirement for an administrator, liquidator or receiver (including administrative receiver) to set aside

a Prescribed Part of the company's property which is subject to a floating charge, and make it available for
unsecured creditors, will not apply to any charge created or otherwise arising under a financial collateral
arrangement (as described in the Financial Collateral Regulations).

**_Foreign currency_**

Under English insolvency law, where creditors are asked to submit formal proofs of claim for their debts,

any proofs of debt of a company payable in a currency other than pounds sterling must be converted by the
officeholder into pounds sterling by reference to the exchange rates prevailing at the date when the company went
into liquidation or administration (or where a liquidation was immediately preceded by an administration, the rate
prevailing on the date that the company entered administration. If a creditor considers the rate to be unreasonable,
they may apply to the court.

**_Security over Shares_**

English law security over the shares in the capital of an English company commonly takes the form of an

equitable charge rather than a legal charge. An equitable charge arises where a chargor creates an encumbrance
over the property in favor of the chargee but the chargor retains legal title to the property. Remedies in relation to
equitable charges may be subject to equitable considerations or are otherwise at the discretion of the court.

The validity of share security and the ability of secured parties to enforce security interests over shares may

additionally be affected by a failure of the charging company or related parties or (in certain circumstances) the
secured parties to comply within the relevant timeframes with the disclosure and notification obligations under
English company statutes in respect of persons with significant control and relevant legal entities.

**_Security over Bank Accounts_**

With respect to any English law charges over cash deposits (each an “Account Charge”) granted by a

company over any of its bank accounts, the banks with which some of those accounts are held (each an “Account
Bank”) may have reserved their right at any time (whether prior to or upon a crystallization event under the
Account Charge) to exercise the rights of netting or set-off to which they are entitled under their cash pooling or
other arrangements with the chargor. As a result, and if the security granted over those accounts is merely a
floating (rather than fixed) charge, the collateral constituted by those bank accounts will typically be subject to
the relevant Account Bank’s netting and set-off rights with respect to the bank accounts charged under the relevant
Account Charge. Once the floating charge has crystallized and converted into a fixed charge (as typically would
occur on enforcement or the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the chargor) the collateral
will no longer be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s netting and set-off rights, since the Account Bank will
only be entitled to exercise its netting and set-off rights while the bank accounts are subject only to floating
security, except where account banks have expressly reserved set-off rights.

**_Schemes of Arrangement (Part 26)_**

Although it is not an insolvency proceeding, pursuant to Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006, the English

courts have jurisdiction to sanction a scheme of arrangement (a “Scheme”) that effects a compromise or
arrangement between a company and its creditors (or any class of them), including secured creditors, or members
(or any class of them) outside of a formal insolvency process.

An English company may be able to pursue a Scheme in respect of its financial liabilities. In addition, a

foreign company (potentially including a foreign Guarantor) which is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency


-----

Act and has a “sufficient connection” to England and Wales could also pursue a Scheme in certain circumstances.
In practice, a foreign company is likely to satisfy the first limb of this test and the second limb has been found to
be satisfied where, amongst other things, the company’s COMI is in England, the company’s finance documents
are English law-governed, or the company’s finance documents have been amended in accordance with their terms
to be governed by English law. Ultimately, each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances
so previous cases will not necessarily determine whether or not any of the grounds of the second limb are satisfied
in any given case. The English courts will refuse to sanction a Scheme for an unregistered company where to do
so would not be likely to serve any real purpose. Whether the effect of the Scheme will be recognized in the
jurisdiction of incorporation of a foreign company or a company with its COMI in a foreign jurisdiction will
depend on the jurisdiction in question. The English court has previously sanctioned Schemes where expert
evidence was provided showing that there was at least a reasonable prospect that a foreign jurisdiction would
recognize the Scheme in that jurisdiction. However, each case will be considered on its particular facts and
circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine whether or not this test would be satisfied in any
given case.

Before the court considers the sanction of a Scheme at a hearing where the fairness and reasonableness of

the Scheme will be considered (the “Sanction Hearing”), the proposed compromise or arrangement must be voted
on by the affected creditors or members (the convening of which is approved by the court). The affected creditors
or members will vote in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights
of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed Scheme and any new rights that such creditors are given
under the Scheme. Classes must be comprised of those persons whose rights are not so dissimilar as to make it
impossible for them to consult together with a view to their common interest. To proceed to the Sanction Hearing,
the Scheme must be approved by at least 75% in value and a majority in number of those present and voting in
person or by proxy in respect of each class, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds contained in the
finance documents.

If approved by the requisite majorities at the scheme meeting(s), the Scheme must then be considered by

the court again at the Sanction Hearing, at which point the court will consider the fairness of the Scheme and
whether it is reasonable. The court has the discretion as to whether to sanction the Scheme as approved, make an
order conditional upon modifications being made or reject the Scheme. If sanctioned by the court, a Scheme will
be binding on each relevant class of creditors (both secured and unsecured) and members including any dissenting
or abstaining party.

Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a Scheme does not automatically trigger a

moratorium of claims or proceedings.

**_Restructuring Plan (Part 26A)_**

The Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 introduced a new type of restructuring procedure (a

“Restructuring Plan”), which is available under Part 26A of the Companies Act and which is similar to a Scheme
under Part 26 of the Companies Act but with a few key differences, including an ability for a cross-class cramdown
to bind dissenting stakeholders to the proposed Restructuring Plan.

Like a Scheme, a Restructuring Plan is available to any company that is liable to be wound up under the

Insolvency Act, excluding certain financial market participants and any other company excluded by the Secretary
of State. The company must: (i) have encountered, or be likely to encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting,
or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern; and (ii) have proposed a compromise or
arrangement with its creditors or members (or any class of them) for the purpose of eliminating, reducing,
preventing or mitigating the effect of such financial difficulties. There is no financial eligibility criteria other than
the financial difficulties test mentioned in (i) above, thereby making the Restructuring Plan procedure available
to both solvent and insolvent companies (in the latter case, the Restructuring Plan would be proposed by the
incumbent insolvency practitioner). Where a convening application is made within 12 weeks after the end of the
new standalone moratorium (see “—Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020”), any creditors in respect
of “moratorium debts” and “priority pre-moratorium debts” (see “—Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act
_2020”) may not participate in the vote and may not be compromised under the Restructuring Plan without their_
consent.


-----

The overall Restructuring Plan process closely resembles that for a Scheme. As an initial step, the company

will seek leave of the court to convene meetings of the relevant classes of its creditors or members (as applicable).
Creditors and members whose rights against the company would be affected by the Restructuring Plan must be
permitted to participate in a convening meeting ordered by the court, provided that this will not apply in relation
to a class of creditors or members of the company if the court is satisfied that none of the members of that class
has a genuine economic interest in the company (in other words, if that class is “out of the money” under the
relevant alternative for the company if the Restructuring Plan is not sanctioned).

At the relevant class meetings, the Restructuring Plan will be deemed approved by a class if a number

representing at least 75% in value of the class of creditors or class of members (as applicable) present and voting
vote in favor of it. In contrast to a Scheme, there is no requirement that a majority in number must also vote in
favor of the Restructuring Plan. Following the creditors’ or members’ meeting(s), a sanction hearing will be held.
Here, the court will consider if the necessary plan requirements have been met, review the fairness of the
Restructuring Plan and consider whether it is reasonable and decide whether to sanction the Restructuring Plan.
The court has discretion to sanction a Restructuring Plan, even if one or more classes of creditors or members did
not vote in favor of it, thereby “cramming-down” dissenting classes, if: (i) the court is satisfied that none of the
members of the dissenting class would be any worse off under the Restructuring Plan than they would be in the
event of the “relevant alternative” (i.e. what the court considers the most likely to occur in relation to the company
if the Restructuring Plan were not sanctioned); and (ii) the Restructuring Plan has been approved by a number
representing at least 75% in value of a class of creditors or members (as applicable), present and voting, who
would receive a payment, or have a genuine economic interest in the company, in the event of the relevant
alternative referred to in (i) above. A Restructuring Plan sanctioned by the court will be binding on all affected
parties, whether they initially voted in favor of it or not.

As with a Scheme, the commencement of a Restructuring Plan process does not automatically trigger a

moratorium of claims or proceedings.

**_Recharacterization of fixed security interests_**

There is a possibility that a court could find that security interests expressed to be fixed charges created by

the security documents governed by English law properly take effect as floating charges – this is because the
description given to them as fixed charges within the security document is not determinative. Whether the
purported fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating security interests
will depend, among other things, on whether the secured party has the requisite degree of control over the
company’s ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is
exercised by the holder of the security, in practice. Where a company is free to deal with the assets that are the
subject of a purported fixed charge in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee, the court would be
likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be
described as a fixed charge. If a fixed security interest is recharacterized as a floating charge, this will, among
other things, adversely impact the returns of the holder of the charge in an administration, liquidation or
administrative receivership (see “—Priority of Claims”) and prevent the holder relying on that charge to appoint
a receiver.

**_Financial Collateral Regulations_**

The Financial Collateral Regulations apply in respect of certain security interests granted over, and certain

title transfer arrangements in, “financial collateral” (together financial collateral arrangements). Financial
collateral is defined in the Financial Collateral Regulations as cash, financial instruments or credit claims. The
definition of “financial instruments” includes shares in companies and debt instruments such as bonds and claims
under loans made by credit institutions.

If an arrangement qualifies as a financial collateral arrangement under the Financial Collateral Regulations

certain modifications or exclusions to English insolvency law apply which remove restrictions on enforcing
security, disapply provisions relating to the order of payment of creditors and prohibit avoidance by the insolvency
officeholder of the financial collateral arrangement in certain situations. For example, security interests to which
the Financial Collateral Regulations apply are not required to be registered as a registrable charge at Companies
House, and are not subject to the statutory moratorium on enforcement of security that would otherwise apply


-----

when a company enters administration. Furthermore, the Financial Collateral Regulations enable the creditor
holding the security interest to appropriate (i.e. to become the absolute legal owner of) the financial collateral to
which the security interests applies without the need for a court order provided the security interests have become
enforceable in accordance with their terms and provided the creditor has been granted the power to appropriate in
the relevant contract.

**_Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020_**

On June 26, 2020, the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (as amended, “CIGA”) came into

force. CIGA introduced some additional restructuring and insolvency procedures, including the Restructuring
Plan (described above).

**_Moratorium_**

CIGA introduced a moratorium procedure, which is available under Part A1 of the Insolvency Act to

certain legal entities (subject to exclusions in Schedule ZA1 of the Insolvency Act), including companies
registered in England, Wales or Scotland and unregistered companies liable to be wound up under Part 5 of the
Insolvency Act, subject to certain exclusions. The moratorium’s initial duration will be for a period of 20 business
days beginning with the business day after the day on which the moratorium comes into force, but this can be
extended (i) by the directors without creditor consent, for a period of a further 20 business days, (ii) with creditor
consent, for a total period of a year (including the initial 20 business day period), and (iii) by the court, for an
unlimited period.

To obtain the benefit of the moratorium, a director of the debtor must (provided that the company is not an

overseas company or already subject to a winding up petition, in which case the directors must apply to the court
for an order for the moratorium) file certain documents at court to certify that, in their view, the debtor is or is
likely to become unable to pay its debts and a licensed insolvency practitioner must certify that, in their view, a
moratorium would be likely to result in the rescue of the company as a going concern. Despite the existence of a
“payment holiday” in respect of certain pre-moratorium debts which exists throughout the moratorium, the
company will still be expected to pay certain debts incurred while the moratorium is in force under an obligation
incurred before the moratorium commenced (known as “priority pre-moratorium debts”), including the costs of
goods and services, employees and rent, together with all amounts falling due under loan agreements and other
financial services contracts.

The moratorium is not available to a company which on the date of filing (i) is a party to an agreement

which is or forms part of a capital market arrangement, (ii) has incurred or, when the agreement was entered into
was expected to incur, a debt of at least £10 million under the arrangement (at any time during the life of the
capital market arrangement) and (iii) the arrangement involves the issue of a capital market investment. The
definitions of “capital market arrangement” and “capital market investment” in Schedule ZA1 of the Insolvency
Act are broad and are such that, in general terms, any company which is a party to an arrangement which involves
at least £10 million of debt, the granting of security to a trustee, and the issue of a rated, listed or traded debt
instrument, is excluded from being eligible for a moratorium. The Secretary of State may modify the criteria by
reference to which a company otherwise eligible for a moratorium is excluded from being so eligible.

_Ipso Facto Clauses_

CIGA introduced a restriction on the operation and exercise of ipso facto clauses in order to preserve the

continuity of the provision of goods and services to companies undergoing certain insolvency procedures. In
general terms, _ipso facto clauses are provisions in contracts for the supply of goods or services which allow_
suppliers to terminate the contract or supply or take any other action, or provide for the automatic termination of
the contract or supply or the occurrence of any other event, upon the counterparty entering an insolvency
procedure.

Under the Insolvency Act as amended by CIGA, any provision of a contract for the supply of goods or

services which allows for the termination of that contract or the supply, or for the supplier to do “any other thing”,
because the counterparty becomes subject to a relevant insolvency procedure, ceases to apply once the
counterparty becomes subject that procedure. For this purpose, a relevant insolvency procedure includes
administration, liquidation and the restructuring plan procedure, but it does not include a scheme of arrangement.


-----

The supplier may terminate the contract if the court is satisfied that the continuation of the contract would cause
the supplier hardship and grants permission for the termination of the contract or (if the company is in
administration or liquidation) with the consent of the relevant office-holder.

The restrictions do not apply to a range of contracts involving financial services or entities involved in the

provision of financial services, including contracts for the provision of lending, financial leasing or guarantees,
contracts for the purchase, sale or loan of securities or commodities and agreements which are, or form part of,
arrangements involving the issue of a capital market investment (as defined in the Insolvency Act).

**Ireland**

The Issuer and a number of the Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Ireland (such Guarantors

together, the “Irish Guarantors”). Any insolvency proceedings applicable to any of them will be likely to be
governed by Irish insolvency laws, although insolvency proceedings in respect of an Irish company could also be
based in other jurisdictions under certain circumstances (see “—Cross-Border Insolvency” below). Irish
insolvency laws differ from the insolvency laws of the United States and may make it more difficult for holders
of the Notes to recover the amount in respect of the Notes or of the Guarantors’ or an Irish Guarantor’s Guarantee
of the Notes than they would have recovered in a liquidation or bankruptcy proceeding in the United States.

**_Cross-Border Insolvency_**

The Issuer and the Irish Guarantors each have registered offices in Ireland. As a result there is a rebuttable

presumption that their center of main interest, for the purposes of any insolvency proceedings under Regulation
(EU) 2015/848 of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings (recast), is in Ireland and consequently it is likely that
main insolvency proceedings applicable to such companies would be governed by Irish law. However, if any of
the Issuer or the Irish Guarantors has its “centre of main interests” in a Member State of the European Union other
than Ireland, then the main insolvency proceedings for that company may be opened in such other Member State
and will be subject to the laws of that Member State.

**_Preferential Creditors_**

Under Section 621 of the Irish Companies Act 2014, as amended (the “2014 Act”), in a winding-up of

an Irish company, preferential debts are required to be paid in priority to all other debts other than those (a) in
respect of any examiners fees and costs if sanctioned by the court pursuant to Section 554 of the 2014 Act or
(b) secured by a fixed charge, or (c) in respect of the winding up costs pursuant to Section 617 of the 2014 Act.

The preferential debts will comprise, among other things, any amounts owed in respect of local rates and

certain amounts owed to the Irish Revenue Commissioners for income/corporation/capital gains tax, VAT, PAYE,
social security and pension scheme contributions and remuneration, salary and wages of employees and certain
contractors.

Furthermore, in a winding up, the costs of the liquidation and the liquidator’s fees will take priority over

the claims of floating chargeholders in respect of relevant assets that are subject to a floating charge. The
remuneration, costs and expenses of an examiner (if any) appointed to the Irish company which have been
sanctioned by the relevant Irish court as reasonable expenses properly incurred by such examiner in the course of
the examinership (which may include borrowings incurred by an examiner during the period of examinership if
the examiner seeks to have them sanctioned by the relevant Irish court under Section 554 of the 2014 Act) will
also take priority over the claims of floating charge holders.

As a result, if the assets of the relevant company available for the payment of general creditors are

insufficient to pay the preferential debts, they are required to be paid out of the property subject to the floating
charge. Under Section 440 of the 2014 Act, the holder of a floating charge, or a receiver appointed by such a
holder, who takes possession of property subject to the floating charge when the company is not in the course of
being wound up, is required to pay the preferential debts out of that property in priority to principal and interest
secured by the floating charge.

In addition, the remuneration of the examiner and the costs (including legal advisors’ fees) of the

examinership will take priority, not only over unsecured creditors and holders of floating security, but also over
holders of fixed security and any capital gains tax payable on the disposition of an asset of the company by a
liquidator, receiver or mortgagee in possession. Any expenses properly incurred by the company in examinership,
which may include any borrowings made by an examiner to fund the company’s requirements for the duration of
his appointment, that have been certified by the examiner and approved by the Irish courts, will rank ahead of


-----

claims of a floating charge holder (see “—Examinership” below). Finally, all claims in one category will receive
full payment before any balance is distributed to the creditors in the next category. When proceeds are insufficient
to meet the claims in one category in full, payments for that category are distributed on a pro rata basis.

**_Disclaimer of Onerous Property_**

Section 615 of the 2014 Act confers power on a liquidator, with leave of the court, at any time within

twelve months after the commencement of the winding-up or such extended period as may be allowed by the
court, to disclaim any property of the Irish company being wound up which consists of, among other things,
(i) unprofitable contracts or (ii) any property which is unsaleable or not readily saleable by reason of its binding
the possessor to the performance of any onerous act or to the payment of money. The liquidator’s hand may be
forced, in that any person interested in the property may require him to decide whether or not he will disclaim and
if the liquidator wishes to disclaim in such circumstances, he must give notice within 28 days or such further
period as may be allowed by the courts that he intends to apply to court to disclaim.

A liquidator must disclaim the whole of the property, he may not keep part and disclaim part. A

disclaimer shall operate to determine as and from the date of the disclaimer the rights, interest and liabilities of
the company in the contract or the property, but, the disclaimer does not affect the rights or liabilities of any other
person, except in so far as necessary for the purpose of releasing the company from liability. Any person who
suffers damages by the operation of a disclaimer shall be deemed a creditor of the company in the amount of the
damages, and may prove that amount as a debt in the winding-up.

The meaning given to an unprofitable contract is one that is onerous in the liquidation. There must be

some “burden” associated with the contract; the mere fact that the insolvent company’s estate would be better off
by disclaimer is not enough.

**_Examinership_**

In addition, a court protection procedure, known as examinership, is available under the 2014 Act to

facilitate the survival of a company and the whole or any part of its undertaking through the appointment of an
examiner and the formulation by the examiner of proposals for a compromise or scheme of arrangement. Provided
a company can demonstrate viability, and can satisfy certain tests, the High Court appoints an independent
examiner whose function is to supervise the restructuring process. During the protection period the examiner will
formulate, in conjunction with the existing stakeholders and potential investors, proposals for a scheme of
arrangement, which are presented to statutory meetings of all members and creditors and ultimately to the High
Court for confirmation. The scheme will provide for the treatment of creditors claims in the restructuring, the
adjustment of the rights of shareholders, and a structure for the investment underpinning the restructuring. Once
confirmed by the High Court the scheme is binding on the company and all its members and creditors. During the
protection period the day-to-day business of the company remains under the control of the directors of the
company, subject to certain rights of the examiner to apply to the High Court.

If the Issuer or any Irish Guarantor is placed in examinership, you may not be able to enforce your rights

under the Notes or any Guarantee of the Notes.

**_Protection Period_**

Where an examinership petition is presented in relation to a company, that company is deemed to be

under the protection of the Court during the period beginning on presentation of the petition and ending 70 days
later (which period may be extended by a further 30 days where the Court is satisfied that the examiner would not
be able to present his report within 70 days, or by such further unlimited period as the Court may allow where the
Court needs more time to consider the proposals contained in the examiner’s final report). In the event of an appeal
of the High Court’s decision, the protection period is likely to be further extended in order to allow the
determination of the appeal.

**_Effect of Appointment of Examiner_**

The effect of the appointment of an examiner is to suspend most of the rights of creditors for the

protection period. For as long as a company is under the protection of the High Court, no attachment,
sequestration, distress or execution shall be put into force against the property or effects of the relevant company
except with the consent of the examiner.

Section 520 of the 2014 Act provides, among other things:

(a) where any claim against the company is secured by a mortgage, charge, lien or other
encumbrance or a pledge of, on or affecting the whole or any part of the property, effects or


-----

income of the Irish company, no action may be taken to realize the whole or any part of such
security except with the consent of the examiner;

(b) no receiver over any part of the property or undertaking of the Irish company shall be
appointed; and

(c) no proceedings for the winding up of the Irish company may be commenced or resolution for
winding up passed in relation to the company in examinership and any resolution so passed
shall have no effect.

No other proceedings in relation to the company may be commenced except by leave of the court and

subject to such terms as it may impose. In addition, no payment may be made by a company during the period
when it is under protection of the court by way of satisfaction or discharge of the whole or any part of a liability
incurred by the company before the date of presentation of the petition for the appointment of the examiner, except
in limited circumstances.

**_Repudiation of contracts_**

Under Section 537 of the 2014 Act (“Section 537”), where proposals for a compromise or scheme of

arrangement are to be formulated in relation to a company, the company may, subject to the approval of the Court,
affirm or repudiate any contract under which some element of performance other than payment remains to be
rendered both by the company and the other contracting party/parties and where the repudiation is necessary for
the survival of the company as a going concern. Any person who suffers loss or damage as a result of such
repudiation stands as an unsecured creditor for the amount of such loss or damage and is entitled to be treated as
such in any scheme of arrangement as if the loss or damage constituted a pre-petition claim. Where the Court
approves the affirmation or repudiation of a contract under Section 537, it may in giving such approval make such
orders as its thinks fit for the purposes of giving full effect to its approval including orders as to notice to, or
declaring the rights of, any party affected by such affirmation or repudiation.

**_Liability of Guarantors_**

The 2014 Act provides, inter alia, that no proceedings of any sort may be commenced against a guarantor

in respect of the debts of the Irish company in examinership, while the company is in examinership. Post
examinership guarantees can be enforced provided certain statutory provisions have been complied with.

**_Priority of Examiner Payments_**

The 2014 Act allows for the remuneration, costs and expenses of the examiner which have been

sanctioned by an order of the court (other than the expenses that, by virtue of section 529 of the 2014 Act, are
treated as expenses properly incurred by the examiner) to be paid prior to any other claims including secured
claims. Section 529 of the 2014 Act provides that any liabilities incurred by a company in examinership which
are certified by the examiner which have been incurred in circumstances where, in the opinion of the examiner,
the survival of the company under court protection as a going concern during the period would otherwise be
seriously prejudiced, shall be treated as expenses properly incurred for the purposes of Section 554 of the 2014
Act but will rank behind the claims of creditors secured by a mortgage, charge, lien or other encumbrance of a
fixed nature or a pledge. Nonetheless, if the court sanctions borrowings by an examiner as part of the expenses of
the examiner pursuant to Section 554 of the 2014 Act, such borrowings will rank ahead of the claims of both
unsecured creditors and creditors secured by a floating charge of the company under court protection.

**_SCARP process_**

The Companies (Rescue Process for Small and Micro Companies) Act 2021 (the “SCARP Act”) was signed

into law on 22 July 2021, and commenced on 7 December 2021. The SCARP Act provides for a new
administrative rescue process – referred to as the Small Company Administrative Rescue Process (“SCARP”) –
which will be available exclusively to small and micro companies.

A small company (excluding a holding company and ineligible companies) is defined as one fulfilling two or

more of the following requirements in relation to a financial year:

  - the amount of turnover does not exceed €12 million;

  - the balance sheet total of the company does not exceed €6 million; and


-----

  - the average number of employees does not exceed 50.

The comparable conditions to qualify as a micro company are:

  - the amount of turnover does not exceed €700,000;

  - the balance sheet total of the company does not exceed €350,000; and

  - the average number of employees does not exceed 10.

As the Issuer and each of the Irish Guarantors is an Irish company, it could be the subject of a SCARP if it

satisfied the relevant conditions under the SCARP Act and if it qualified as a either a small company or a micro
company (as outlined above);

The SCARP process is similar to examinership (as discussed above) but differs from examinership in some

material ways, including:

  - The Irish Revenue Commissioners (and other state creditors) may object to the inclusion of certain
“excludable liabilities” (pertaining to unpaid taxes and liabilities with respect to the Irish Revenue
Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection and other liabilities arising from the
Redundancy Payments and Protection of Employees Acts).

  - The Issuer and the Irish Guarantors would have no automatic protections against enforcement by their
creditors and would have to apply to the court for protective orders.

  - The SCARP process cannot be initiated by a creditor.

  - The SCARP process is not currently recognized under the New EU Insolvency Regulation.

**_Primary risks for Holders of Notes in a SCARP process_**

The primary risks to the holders of the Notes, under the laws of Ireland, if the Issuer and/or Irish Guarantors

were subject to the SCARP process and where any amounts due under the Notes were unpaid, are as follows: (a)
there may be a delay in enforcing the payment obligations of the Issuer and/or the relevant Irish Guarantors in
respect of the Notes; (b) the potential for a “rescue plan” devised by the “process adviser” (an insolvency
practitioner who must be qualified to act as a liquidator under the Companies Act) being approved which involves
the writing down or rescheduling of the debt due by the Issuer and/or the relevant Irish Guarantors to the holders
of the Notes; (c) the potential for a repudiation of contracts on behalf of the Issuer and/or the relevant Irish
Guarantors where the process adviser considers it necessary for the survival of the Issuer and/or the relevant Irish
Guarantors as a going concern (whilst court approval is not required, the right is subject to certain notice
obligations and the right of claimants to object to the proposed repudiation); and (d) in the event that a rescue plan
is not approved in respect of the Issuer and/or the relevant Irish Guarantors and the Issuer and/or the relevant Irish
Guarantors subsequently goes into liquidation, the process advisor’s remuneration and expenses will take priority
over the moneys and liabilities which from time to time are or may become due, owing or payable by it to the
holders of the Notes.

**_Improper Transfers/Fraudulent Preference_**

Under Section 608 (Power of the court to order the return of assets improperly transferred—liquidator)

of the 2014 Act, Section 443 (Power of the court to order the return of assets improperly transferred—receiver)
of the 2014 Act and Section 557 (Power of the court to order the return of assets improperly transferred—
examiner) of the 2014 Act, if it can be shown on the application of a liquidator, creditor, contributory of a
company, receiver or examiner (as applicable), to the satisfaction of the High Court, that any property of that
company was disposed of (including a disposal by way of charge, security assignment, mortgage or in any way
whatsoever and the effect of such a disposal was to “perpetrate a fraud” on the company, its creditors or members,
the High Court may, if it deems it just and equitable to do so, order any person who appears to have “use, control
or possession” of the property concerned, or of the proceeds of the sale or development of that property, to deliver
it or them, or to pay a sum in respect of it to the liquidator, receiver or examiner (as applicable) on such terms as
the High Court sees fit.


-----

Section 604 (Unfair preference: effect of winding up on antecedent and other transactions) of the 2014

Act provides that any conveyance, mortgage, delivery of goods, payment, execution or other act relating to
property made or done by or against a company which is unable to pay its debts as they become due in favor of
any creditor of the company or any person on trust for any such creditor, with a view to giving such creditor (or
any surety or guarantor of the debt due to such creditor) a preference over the company’s other creditors, shall be
deemed to be an unfair preference of its creditors and be invalid accordingly if a winding up of the company
commences within six months of the doing of the act and the company is, at the date of commencement of the
winding up, unable to pay its debts (taking into account contingent and prospective liabilities).Where the
conveyance, mortgage, delivery of goods, payment, execution or other act is in favor of a “connected person,” the
six month period is extended to two years and the act in question shall be deemed, if the Company is being wound
up and is, at the time that the winding up commences, unable to pay its debts, to have been done with a view to
giving the connected person a preference over the Company’s other creditors, to be an unfair preference, and to
be invalid. Consequently, the burden of proof is on the connected person to show that any such act was not an
unfair preference.

**_Corporate Benefit_**

We believe that in the case of the Guarantees given by the Irish Guarantors, these will be given in good

faith for the purposes of carrying on each of their businesses and that there will be reasonable grounds for believing
that they would benefit each such Irish Guarantor. There can be no assurance, however, that the provision of the
Guarantees by the Irish Guarantors will not be challenged by a liquidator, on the basis that the Irish Guarantors
did not receive any benefit, or that a court would support this analysis.

If the corporate benefit requirement is not met, (a) the directors of the company may be held liable by

the company for negligence in the management of the company; or (b) the validity of the guarantees could be
open to challenge.

**_Financial Assistance_**

The Notes may only be guaranteed by the relevant Irish company to the extent that it would not result in

such guarantee constituting the giving of unlawful financial assistance under Section 82 of the 2016 Act.

**_Recharacterization of a Fixed Charge_**

It is open to a court to find that assignments and charges described as fixed charges constitute floating

charges rather than fixed charges, the description given to them as fixed charges not being determinative and no
opinion is expressed on whether security interests created by a security document are fixed charges or floating
charges. One of the three characteristics of a floating charge is the ability of the chargor to carry on business in
the ordinary way so far as concerns the particular class of assets in question until some further step is taken by or
on behalf of the chargee. Where the chargor is free to deal with the assets, which form the subject matter of the
charge, without the consent of the chargee, or the chargee does not exercise the requisite degree of control over
the assets, or the proceeds of such assets, the court would be likely to hold that the charge in question constitutes
a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge. Irish case law has interpreted the
requisite level of control to a high standard. To the extent that any of the secured assets are not specifically
identified a court may hold that such assets which are expressed to be subject to a fixed charge may in fact be
subject to a floating charge. It should be noted that insofar as any of the security documents purport to create fixed
security over future assets the asset must either be identified as at the date of execution of the security documents
or identifiable as falling within the security purported to be created thereby.

A floating charge is more vulnerable than a fixed charge both to being set aside in a winding-up and to

losing its priority to other rights and interests.

Moreover, amounts received in a winding-up or receivership by realizing assets subject to a floating

charge must first be used to pay certain preferential debts (see “Preferential Creditors” above).

The effectiveness of any crystallization clause in the security documents is unclear although it has been

held by the Supreme Court that a crystallization notice served by the chargee was valid to crystallize the floating
charge and that the floating charge had become a fixed charge and, as such, ranked ahead of preferential creditors
and pari passu with other fixed security over the chargor’s assets. The service of any such notice of crystallization
should, to be effective, occur immediately prior to enforcement or be accompanied by restrictions on the use of
the charged asset consisted with a fixed charge.


-----

**_Limitations on Enforcement of Security_**

A fixed charge on book debts is subject to the provisions of Section 1001 Taxes Consolidation Act 1997

which provides inter alia that on receipt of a notice from the Revenue Commissioners that the chargor is in arrears
on its PAYE (pay-as-you-earn), VAT (value added tax), PRSI (pay-related social insurance) or LPT (local
property tax) payments, the holder of the fixed charge must thereafter pay all sums it receives from the chargor to
the Revenue Commissioners until the arrears (and any further arrears which accrue) of PAYE, VAT, PRSI or LPT
payments (as the case may be) have been discharged in full. However, if within 21 days of execution of the charge,
the Revenue Commissioners receive notice of the prescribed details of the fixed charge over book debts, then
payments to the Revenue Commission will be limited to any arrears accruing after the date of such notice.

Monies held in a bank account of the Company could, notwithstanding any charge or right of set-off over

such account being held by the Security Agent, be subject to Section 1002 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997
which provides inter alia that on receipt of a notice from the Revenue Commissioners that a taxpayer is in arrears
in the discharge of any tax, interest or penalty, a person owing money to the taxpayer (including, without
limitation, a bank holding monies of the taxpayer) must pay such monies to the Revenue Commissioners.

On a disposal of any secured assets on an enforcement of the security created pursuant to the security

documents, the Security Agent may be required to pay any capital gains tax owed in respect of those assets in
priority to the debts secured by such assets.

Failure to register the particulars of the security documents and any other requisite documents in the

Companies Registration Office within 21 days of the date of creation of the security in accordance with the 2014
Act will render the relevant charge void as against any liquidator or creditor of the Company.

To the extent that the legal title (as distinct from the beneficial title) to any of the secured assets is not

held by the Company, then the legal title will not be subject to the security created by the Security Documents.

**Jersey**

**_Insolvency_**

eircom Limited (Jersey), which is one of the Guarantors, is incorporated under the laws of Jersey.

Consequently, in the event of an insolvency of eircom Limited (Jersey), insolvency proceedings may be initiated
in Jersey. There are two principal regimes for corporate insolvency in Jersey: désastre and the “creditors’ winding
up”. The “désastre” procedure in respect of a Jersey company may be instigated by the Jersey Financial Services
Commission, an eligible creditor or the company making an application for an Act of the Royal Court of Jersey
under the Bankruptcy (Désastre) (Jersey) Law 1990, as amended (the “Jersey Bankruptcy Law”) declaring the
property of a debtor to be “en désastre” (a “declaration”). On a declaration of désastre, title and possession of the
property of the debtor vest automatically in the Viscount, an official of the Royal Court (the “Viscount”). With
effect from the date of declaration, a creditor has no other remedy against the property or person of the debtor in
respect of the debt, and may not commence or, except with the consent of the Viscount or the Royal Court,
continue any action or legal proceedings to recover the debt. A secured party may, however, without the consent
of the Viscount and without an order of the court, exercise any power of enforcement it may have under Part 7
(Enforcement of Security Interests) of the Security Interests (Jersey) Law 2012 (the “2012 Law”). To the extent
that the proceeds of such enforcement are insufficient to discharge liabilities owed, that secured party has no other
remedy against the property or person of the debtor in respect of the balance of the debt, and may not commence
or, except with the consent of the Viscount or the Royal Court, continue any action or legal proceedings to recover
the balance of the debt.

There are two forms of “creditors’ winding up” available in respect of a Jersey company pursuant to the

Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, as amended (the “Jersey Companies Law”): (a) a court ordered procedure (a “court
ordered creditors’ winding up”) which is instigated by an eligible creditor of the company making an application
for an order of the Royal Court to commence a creditors' winding up; and (b) a voluntary procedure (a “non-court
ordered creditors’ winding up”) which is instigated by a special resolution of the shareholders of the company.
On a creditors’ winding up, a liquidator is nominated by the creditors applying creditor (in the case of a court
ordered creditors’ winding up) or the shareholders (in the case of a non-court ordered creditors' winding up). The
court (in the case of a court ordered creditors’ winding up) or the creditors (in the case of a non-court ordered
creditors’ winding up) may approve such a liquidator or appoint a different liquidator. In the case of a court
ordered creditors’ winding up, the Royal Court may also appoint a provisional liquidator in the intervening period
between the initial application and the order to commence the creditors' winding up. In the case of a court ordered
creditors’ winding up, the liquidator (including any liquidator appointed provisionally) must, within seven days
of their appointment, give known creditors notice calling a creditors’ meeting to be held 21 days’ after the date of


-----

the relevant order of the Royal Court and, in the case of a non-court ordered creditors’ winding up, the shareholders
must give creditors 14 days’ notice of the meeting to commence the creditors’ winding up, with a meeting of
creditors’ to be held immediately following such commencement meeting. Any liquidator appointed provisionally
will carry out such functions as conferred by, and may have their powers limited by, the Royal Court. Once the
creditors’ winding up has commenced, the liquidator will stand in the shoes of the directors and administer the
winding up, gather assets, make appropriate disposals of assets, settle claims and distribute assets as appropriate.
After the appointment of a liquidator provisionally or the commencement of the creditors’ winding up, no action
can be taken or proceeded with against the company except with the leave of the Royal Court. A secured party
may, however, without the sanction of a liquidator and without an order of the Royal Court, exercise any power
of enforcement it may have under Part 7 (Enforcement of Security Interests) of the 2012 Law. To the extent that
the proceeds of such enforcement are insufficient to discharge liabilities owed, that secured party has no other
remedy against the company, and may not, without leave of the Royal Court, take or proceed with any other action
to recover the balance of the debt. The corporate state and capacity of the company continues until the end of the
winding up procedure, when the company is dissolved. The Jersey Companies Law requires a creditor of a
company (subject to appeal) to be bound by an arrangement entered into by the company and its creditors
immediately before or in the course of its creditors’ winding up if (among other things) three quarters in number
and value of the creditors acceded to the arrangement.

**_Transactions at an Undervalue_**

Under Article 17 of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 176 of the Jersey Companies Law, the court

may, on the application of the Viscount (in the case of a company whose property has been declared “en désastre”)
or liquidator (in the case of a creditors’ winding up), set aside a transaction (including any guarantee or security
interest) entered into by a company with any person (the “other party”) at an undervalue. There is a five-year lookback period from the date of commencement of the winding up or declaration of “désastre” during which
transactions are susceptible to examination pursuant to this rule (the “relevant time”). The Jersey Bankruptcy Law
and Jersey Companies Law contain detailed provisions, including (without limitation) those that define what
constitutes a transaction at an undervalue, the operation of the relevant time and the effect of entering into such a
transaction with a person connected with the company or with an associate of the company.

**_Preferences_**

Under Article 17A of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 176A of the Jersey Companies Law, the

court may, on the application of the Viscount (in the case of a company whose property has been declared “en
_désastre”) or liquidator (in the case of a creditors’ winding up), set aside a preference (including any guarantee or_
security interest) given by the company to any person (the “other party”). There is a 12-month look-back period
from the date of commencement of the winding up or declaration of “désastre” during which transactions are
susceptible to examination pursuant to this rule (the “relevant time”). The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Jersey
Companies Law contain detailed provisions, including (without limitation) those that define what constitutes a
preference, the operation of the relevant time and the effect of entering into a preference with a person connected
with the company or with an associate of the company.

**_Extortionate Transactions, Onerous Property, Disclaimer and Customary Law Fraudulent Dispositions_**

Under Article 17C of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 179 of the Jersey Companies Law, the court

may, on the application of the Viscount (in the case of a company whose property has been declared “en désastre”)
or liquidator (in the case of a creditors’ winding up), set aside a transaction providing credit to the debtor company
which is or was extortionate. There is a three-year look-back period from the date of commencement of the
winding up or declaration of “désastre” during which transactions are susceptible to examination pursuant to this
rule. The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Jersey Companies Law contain detailed provisions, including (without
limitation) those that define what constitutes a transaction which is extortionate.

Under Article 15 of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law, the Viscount may within six months following the date

of the declaration of “désastre” and under Article 171 of the Jersey Companies Law, a liquidator may within six
months following the commencement of a creditors’ winding up, disclaim any onerous property of the company.
“Onerous property” is defined to include any moveable property, a contract lease or other immoveable property
if it is situated outside of Jersey that is unsaleable or not readily saleable or is such that it might give rise to a
liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act, and includes an unprofitable contract.

A disclaimer operates to determine, as from the date it is made, the rights, interests and liabilities of the

company/debtor in or in respect of the property disclaimed and discharges the company/Viscount from all liability
in respect of the property as of the date of the commencement of the creditors’ winding up/from the date of the
declaration but shall not, except so far as is necessary for the purpose of releasing the company/debtor, debtor’s


-----

property and the Viscount from liability, affect the rights or liabilities of any other person. A person sustaining
loss or damage as a result of a disclaimer is deemed to be a creditor of the company to the extent of the loss or
damage and shall have standing as a creditor in the désastre or creditors’ winding up. The Jersey Bankruptcy Law
and Jersey Companies Law contain detailed provisions, including (without limitation) in relation to the power to
disclaim onerous property.

In addition to the Jersey statutory provisions referred to above, there are certain principles of Jersey

customary law (for example, a Pauline action) under which dispositions of assets with the intention of defeating
creditors’ claims may be set aside.

**_Enforcement of Security and Security in Insolvency_**

Under the laws of Jersey, a person incorporated, resident or domiciled in Jersey is deemed to have

capacity to grant security governed by foreign law over property situated outside Jersey, but to the extent that any
floating charge or other security interest governed by a foreign law is expressed to apply to any asset, property
and undertaking of a person incorporated, resident or domiciled in Jersey such floating charge or other security
interest is not likely to be held valid and enforceable by the Courts of Jersey in respect of Jersey situs assets.

The Insolvency Act 1986 (either as originally enacted or as amended, including by the provisions of the

Enterprise Act 2002) does not apply in Jersey and receivers, administrative receivers and administrators are not
part of the laws of Jersey. Accordingly, the Courts of Jersey may not recognize the powers of an administrator,
administrative receiver or other receiver appointed in respect of Jersey situs assets.

However, the Jersey court may, under Article 49(1) of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law assist the courts of

prescribed countries and territories and, applying general principles of comity assist the courts in other
jurisdictions, in all matters relating to the insolvency of any person to the extent that the Jersey court thinks fit.
Further, in doing so, the Royal Court may have regard to the UNCITRAL model law, even though the model law
has not been (and is unlikely to be) implemented as a separate law in Jersey.

If insolvency proceedings have been commenced in another jurisdiction in relation to a Jersey company,

the nature and extent of the cooperation from Jersey is likely to depend on the nature of the requesting country’s
insolvency regime.

In the case of both statutory and non-statutory requests for assistance, it should not be assumed that the

UNCITRAL provisions will automatically be followed. That is a matter for the discretion of the Royal Court. It
would also be wrong to assume that the position reached by the Royal Court, in its discretion, will be in accordance
with EU Insolvency Regulation. Jersey does not form part of the European Community for the purposes of
implementation of its directions. Accordingly, the EU Insolvency Regulation does not apply as a matter of Jersey
domestic law and the automatic test of centre of main interests does not apply as a result.

Enforcement of a security interest against a Jersey company may be further limited by bankruptcy,

insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, re-organization or other laws of general application relating to or affecting
the rights of creditors, and laws in relation to transactions at undervalue, preference, extortionate credit
transactions, disclaimer of onerous property and fraudulent dispositions also apply in Jersey.

Under Jersey law, security over Jersey situs assets is created in accordance with the provisions of Jersey

law. The Jersey situs assets of the Issuer and certain other Obligors will be secured pursuant to Jersey law governed
security interest agreements. The 2012 Law provides that a secured party may enforce security over intangible
movable assets by way of sale or appropriation of the collateral or proceeds. In addition, a secured party may take
certain ancillary actions, including any bespoke enforcement powers included in a security agreement, to the
extent not in conflict with the 2012 Law. More than one enforcement option can be taken, and taking one or more
of the enforcement options specified above does not preclude the exercise of other rights of a secured party. The
power of enforcement is exercisable once an event of default has occurred and written notice specifying the event
of default has been served on the grantor by the secured party. If enforcement is by way of sale or appropriation,
the secured party must give the grantor 14 days’ prior written notice. Importantly, the grantor may agree in writing
to waive its right to notice of appropriation or sale and it is usual to include such a waiver in the security agreement.
The secured party is obliged on sale or appropriation, to give at least 14 days’ prior written notice to: (i) any
person who, 21 days before the sale or appropriation, has a registered security interest in the collateral; and (ii)
any person other than the grantor who has an interest in the collateral and has, not less than 21 days before the
sale or appropriation, given the secured party notice of that interest unless, in each case, the secured party and
such person have otherwise agreed in writing. There are specific carve-outs from the obligation to give notice of
sale. On exercising the power of enforcement by appropriation or sale, the secured party must: (i) take all
commercially reasonable steps to determine or, in the case of a sale, obtain the fair market value of the collateral,


-----

as at the time of the relevant appropriation or sale; (ii) act in a commercially reasonable manner in relation to the
appropriation or sale; and (iii) (in the case of a sale only) enter into any agreement for or in relation to the sale
only on commercially reasonable terms. The duty of the secured party is owed to the grantor and also to any other
person to whom the secured party was required to give notice of sale or appropriation (whether or not they have
agreed in writing to waive the notice requirements). If, in exercising its powers of enforcement, a secured party
appropriates or sells collateral, it must, within 14 days after the day on which the collateral is appropriated or sold,
give certain persons (being the grantor (subject to it having waived this requirement), any person with a registered
subordinate security interest and certain persons claiming an interest in the collateral) a written statement of
account setting out certain information in relation to that appropriation or sale. If a secured party has sold or
appropriated the collateral and the net value or proceeds of appropriation or sale (as appropriate) of the collateral
exceeds the amount of the debt owed to the secured party, the secured party shall pay the amount of any resulting
surplus in the following order: (i) in payment, in due order of priority, to any person who has a subordinate security
interest in the collateral and has registered a financing statement over that security interest (where the registration
remained effective immediately before the appropriation or sale); (ii) in payment to any other person (other than
the grantor) who has given the secured party notice that that person claims an interest in the collateral and in
respect of which the secured party is satisfied that that person has a legally enforceable interest in the collateral;
and (iii) as to the balance (if any) in payment to the relevant debtor grantor. Alternatively, the secured party may
discharge its obligation above with respect to any surplus by paying that amount into the Royal Court. The surplus
may then only be paid out on the order of the Royal Court on application by a person entitled to the surplus.

In the case of the bankruptcy of the grantor of a security interest under the 2012 Law, such security

interest is void against the Viscount (or liquidator of such grantor) and such grantor's creditors unless such security
interest is perfected in accordance with the 2012 Law before such grantor becomes bankrupt.

**Luxembourg**

**_Luxembourg insolvency proceedings_**

Under Luxembourg insolvency laws, the following types of proceedings (together referred to as

Insolvency Proceedings) may be opened against any of the Guarantors being incorporated in Luxembourg (being,
at the date of this Offering Memorandum, Eircom Finco S.à r.l.) (the “Luxembourg Obligor”) to the extent that
such Luxembourg Obligor has its principal establishment (établissement principal) or its centre of main interests
(centre des intérêts principaux) (for the purposes of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in Luxembourg:

##### • bankruptcy proceedings (faillite); 

In addition to these proceedings, the ability of the holders of Notes to receive payment under the Notes

may be affected by a decision of the Luxembourg District Court sitting in commercial matters (Tribunal
_d’arrondissement siégeant en matière commerciale) granting suspension of payments (sursis de paiements) or_
putting the Luxembourg Obligor into judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire) or by a decision of the
Luxembourg business register to proceed with an administrative dissolution without liquidation .

**_Bankruptcy (faillite)_**

_General administration of bankruptcy proceedings_

The opening of bankruptcy proceedings may be requested by the Luxembourg Obligor or by any of its

creditors. Following such a request, the Commercial District Court having jurisdiction may open bankruptcy
proceedings in the event that the Luxembourg Obligor (a) has ceased to make payments (cessation de paiements)
(meaning that the Luxembourg Obligor does not pay its debts as they fall due) and (b) has lost its commercial
creditworthiness (ébranlement de crédit) (meaning that the Luxembourg Obligor no longer has the ability to obtain
financing at normal commercial terms). If the Commercial District Court considers that these conditions are met,
it may open bankruptcy proceedings on its own motion, absent a request made by the Luxembourg Obligor or a
creditor.

If the Commercial District Court declares a company bankrupt, it will appoint one or more bankruptcy

receivers (curateur(s)), depending on the complexity of the proceedings and a supervisory judge (juge_commissaire) to supervise the bankruptcy proceedings._

The period within which creditors must file their proof of claims (déclaration de créance) is specified in

the judgment adjudicating the company bankrupt. Claims filed after such period may nevertheless be taken into
account by the bankruptcy receiver subject to certain limitations as to distributable proceeds.


-----

The bankruptcy receiver takes over the management and control of the company in place of the directors

or the managers. The bankruptcy receiver will realize the company’s assets and distribute the proceeds to the
company’s creditors in accordance with the statutory order of payment and, if there are any funds left, to the
bankrupt company’s shareholders. The bankruptcy receiver represents the company as well as the creditors
collectively (masse des créanciers).

The bankruptcy receiver will need to obtain of the Commercial District Court permission for certain acts,

such as agreeing to a settlement of claims or deciding to pursue the business of the company during the bankruptcy
proceedings.

Bankruptcy is a matter of public policy, which generally delays the process and limits restructuring

options of the group to which the bankrupt company belongs.

On closing of the bankruptcy proceedings, the bankrupt company will normally be dissolved.

**_Effects of bankruptcy proceedings_**

The main effect of bankruptcy proceedings is the suspension of all measures of enforcement against the

Luxembourg Obligor, except, subject to certain limited exceptions, for secured creditors, and the payment of
creditors in accordance with their rank upon the realization of the assets of the Luxembourg Obligor.

As from the judgment declaring the Luxembourg Obligor bankrupt, outstanding debts of the Luxembourg

Obligor (which are not yet due) are accelerated and the creditors of the Luxembourg Obligor can file their proof
of claims with the Luxembourg District Court sitting in commercial matters.

In principle, contracts of the bankrupt company are not automatically terminated on commencement of

bankruptcy proceedings, save for contracts for which the identity or solvency of the company was crucial (intuitu
personae agreements) for the other party. However, certain contracts are terminated automatically by law, such as
employment contracts, unless expressly confirmed by the receiver. Contractual provisions purporting to terminate
a contract upon bankruptcy or the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings are generally held as being valid. The
receiver may choose to terminate contracts of the company subject to the obligations that the Luxembourg Obligor
may have to perform first its obligations (rule of “exceptio non adimpleti contractus”) and the creditors’ interest.

Unsecured claims will, in the event of a liquidation of the Luxembourg Obligor, only rank after the cost

of liquidation (including any debt incurred for the purpose of such liquidation) and those debts of the relevant
entity that are entitled to priority under Luxembourg law. Preferential debts under Luxembourg law include,
among others:

##### • certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg Revenue; 

 • value-added tax and other taxes and duties owed to the Luxembourg Customs and Excise; 

 • social security contributions; and 

 • salaries, wages, and indemnities owed to employees resulting from the execution or the
termination of an employment contract.

Assets over which a security interest has been granted will in principle not be available for distribution

to unsecured creditors of the Luxembourg Obligor (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is realized
and subject to application of the relevant priority rules, liens and privileges arising mandatorily by law). During
insolvency proceedings, all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors of the Luxembourg Obligor are
suspended.

Luxembourg insolvency laws may also affect transactions entered into or payments made by the

Luxembourg Obligor during the pre-bankruptcy hardening period (période suspecte) which is a period of a
maximum of six months (and ten days depending on the transaction in question) preceding the judgment declaring
bankruptcy, except that in certain specific situations the Commercial District Court may set the start of the suspect
period at an earlier date. In particular:

##### • pursuant to article 445 of the Luxembourg code of commerce, some transactions (in particular,
the granting of a security interest for antecedent debts); the payment of debts which have not
fallen due, whether payment is made in cash or by way of assignment, sale, set-off or by any
other means; the payment of debts which have fallen due by any means other than in cash or by
bill of exchange (unless, arguably, that method of payment was agreed from inception);


-----

transactions without consideration or with substantially inadequate consideration entered into
during the suspect period (or the ten days preceding it)) are null and void by operation of law;

##### • pursuant to article 446 of the Luxembourg code of commerce, payments made for matured debts
as well as other transactions concluded for consideration during the suspect period are subject
to setting aside by the Commercial District Court upon proceedings initiated by the bankruptcy
receiver, if they were concluded with the knowledge of the bankrupt’s cessation of payments;
and

##### • pursuant to article 448 of the Luxembourg code of commerce and article 1167 of the
Luxembourg civil code (action paulienne), the bankruptcy receiver (acting on behalf of the
creditors) has the right to challenge any fraudulent payments and transactions, including the
granting of security with an intent to defraud, made prior to the bankruptcy, without any time
limit.

The Luxembourg Law of August 5, 2005 on collateral arrangements, (as amended, the Collateral Act

2005) provides that with the exception of the provisions of the Luxembourg law of January 8, 2013 on overindebtedness (surendettement) (which only apply to natural persons), the provisions of Book III, Title XVII of the
Luxembourg Civil Code, the provisions of Book 1, Title VIII of the Luxembourg Commercial Code, the
provisions of Book III of the Luxembourg Commercial Code and the national or foreign provisions governing
reorganization measures, winding-up proceedings or other similar proceedings and attachments are not applicable
to financial collateral arrangements (such as Luxembourg pledges over shares of Luxembourg private or public
limited companies or receivables) and shall not constitute an obstacle to the enforcement and to the performance
by the parties of their obligations. Certain preferred creditors of the Luxembourg Obligor (including the
Luxembourg tax, social security and other authorities) may have a privilege that ranks senior to the rights of the
secured or unsecured creditors.

**_Reorganization plans_**

The Luxembourg law of 7 August 2023 on business continuity and modernizing bankruptcy law

(hereafter the “Restructuring Law”) has implemented in Luxembourg the Directive (EU) 2019/1023 of 20 June
2019 on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to
increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending
Directive (EU) 2017/1132. The Restructuring Law came into effect on 1 November 2023.

Prior to the Restructuring Law, Luxembourg law offered certain restructuring procedures including

composition with creditors (“concordat”), controlled management (“gestion contrôlée”) and suspension of
payments (“sursis de paiement”). The Restructuring Law has repealed these restructuring procedures which were
considered unsuitable and rarely applied. However, these procedures will temporarily remain in the Luxembourg
legal framework for the sole purpose of the closure of ongoing proceedings.

The main objective of the Restructuring Law is to prevent companies to be declared bankrupt by the

introduction of new measures designed to detect companies in financial difficulties at an earlier stage and to offer
debtors alternatives to restructure their assets or activities either in an extra-judicial agreement with creditors or
under the supervision of the court.

Currently, due to the recent entry into force, the interpretation and application by the Luxembourg courts

of certain provisions of the Restructuring Law to actual cases is still evolving.

_Preventive Measures_

Under the Restructuring Law, the Minister of the Economy (le ministre ayant l’Économie dans ses

_attributions) and the Minister for Small and Medium-sized Businesses (le ministre ayant les Classes moyennes_
_dans les siennes) are responsible, within their respective attributions, for detecting debtors facing financial_
difficulties when such difficulties are likely to jeopardise the continuity of the debtor’s business.

A special Evaluation Committee for Businesses in Difficulties (Cellule d’évaluation des entreprises en

_difficultés) has been established whose members are appointed by the Minister of the Economy including officers_
of the direct and indirect tax and social security administrations.

Preventive measures have been put in place to identify companies in financial difficulties referred to by

the Restructuring Law in order to provide them information on the reorganization measures available to them as


-----

well as conservatory measures in which a company may ask that a conciliator (conciliateur d’entreprise) be
appointed to facilitate the reorganisation of all or part of the assets of the company or its activities, or in the case
of serious and qualified breaches (manquements graves et caractérisés) of the Luxembourg Obligor or one of its
bodies, the Luxembourg district court (tribunal d’arrondissement siégeant en matière commerciale) (the
“Luxembourg Court”) may appoint one or several experts (mandataires de justice) to preserve continuity of the
business.

_Reorganization by mutual agreement (réorganisation par accord amiable)_

The Luxembourg Obligor and/or at least two of its creditors may negotiate and reach an agreement for

purpose of the reorganization of part or all of the Luxembourg Obligor’s assets or activities. The Luxembourg
Obligor may request the appointment of a conciliator whose mission is the conclusion of the agreement and/or to
facilitate the implementation and enforcement of the mutual agreement. The Luxembourg Court, at the request of
the Luxembourg Obligor, certifies the agreement (homologation) after verifying that it has been concluded with
a view to restructure all or part of the Luxembourg Obligor's assets or activities, and declares it enforceable. Once
certified (homologué), the agreement cannot, in principle, be appealed or challenged even if the Luxembourg
Obligor is later declared bankrupt. Neither the agreement itself, nor any of the actions taken in execution thereof
can be challenged in case of bankruptcy, even during the hardening period.

The mutual agreement is confidential and third parties (which are not party to the agreement) may only

get access to the agreement with the express consent of the debtor.

_Judicial Reorganization Proceedings (réorganisation judiciaire)_

The objective of the judicial reorganization proceedings is, under the supervision of the court, to preserve

the continuity of all or part of the Luxembourg Obligor's assets or activities by:

(i) granting a suspension of payments (sursis) to facilitate the conclusion of a mutual agreement (accord
_amiable) within the reorganization by mutual agreement;_

(ii) obtaining the consent of the creditors on a restructuring plan for the Luxembourg Obligor
(réorganisation judiciaire par accord collectif), or

(iii) transferring of all or part of the assets or activities of the Luxembourg Obligorr to one or more third
parties by court decision, which can be initiated either by the Luxembourg Obligor or by the state
prosecutor.

The Luxembourg Obligor may request the opening of a judicial reorganization proceeding by means of

an application (requête) filed with the court if the Luxembourg Obligor’s continuity appears to be jeopardized at
short or longer term, even if the conditions of bankruptcy proceedings are fulfilled. Specific provisions are
applicable in case of repetitive procedures.

Upon filing of the application and until the court has ruled, the Luxembourg Obligor may not be declared

bankrupt and it cannot, in principle, be wound-up by a judicial decision (dissolution judiciaire) nor subject to an
administrative dissolution without liquidation (dissolution administrative sans liquidation), neither can its assets
be realized by enforcement proceedings.

The court maintains a file for the reorganization. The declaration by a creditor of a receivable owed to it

suspends the statute of limitations applicable to such receivable and is considered as a formal notice of payment
(mise en demeure).

The court’s decision on the opening of the judicial reorganization orders an initial suspension of payments

of the Luxembourg Obligor for a maximum of four months in order to fulfil the objective of the judicial
reorganization. The court decision is published and the Luxembourg Obligor shall notify the creditors individually
of the court decision within 14 days.

The suspension of payments may be extended, but may not exceed twelve months.

During the suspension of payments, the enforcement proceedings targeting the Luxembourg Obligor’s

assets are suspended. Notwithstanding the suspension of payments, the Luxembourg Obligor may still pay


-----

outstanding debts if necessary for its continuity.

The Luxembourg Obligor or any interested third party may request the appointment of an expert

(mandataire de justice) to assist the Luxembourg Obligor in fulfilling the objective of the judicial reorganization.
Should a conciliator have been previously appointed, the court can decide to terminate part or all of the mission
of the conciliator.

The Luxembourg Obligor may modify the initial objective of the judicial reorganization once in the

course of the proceedings. The Luxembourg Obligor may also withdraw its request for judicial reorganization at
any time.

Where the Luxembourg Obligor is no longer in a position to ensure the continuity of all or part of its

assets or activities with regard to the restructuring plan, the Luxembourg Obligor, the public prosecutor or any
interested party may request the early termination of the judicial reorganization proceedings by decision of the
court. In the same judgment, the court may order the opening of bankruptcy (faillite) proceedings against the
Luxembourg Obligor if the conditions are met.

In case of serious misconduct of the Luxembourg Obligor, the public prosecutor or any interested third

party may request the appointment of an interim administrator (administrateur provisoire) to replace the
Luxembourg Obligor during the stay (sursis).

The purpose of the judicial reorganization which pursues a restructuring plan is to reach an overall

agreement with the Luxembourg Obligor's creditors in order to organize the payment of its debts. For such
purpose, the Luxembourg Obligor must prepare a restructuring plan setting out, among other things, payment
deadlines and debt waivers. The execution of the proposed restructuring plan may not exceed five years from the
date of its approval by the court. The proposed restructuring plan will be submitted to the vote of the creditors in
each class (ordinary and extraordinary). The restructuring plan is considered approved when a majority of
creditors in each class, representing at least half of all sums due in that class, vote in favor. Once approved, the
plan may be certified by the court, making it legally binding on the creditors. Should the reorganization plan not
be approved in each class entitled to vote, it may still be homologated upon proposal and/or agreement of the
Luxembourg Obligor if the plan was approved by at least one class of creditors entitled to vote providing that the
restructuring plan (i) is in the best interest of all of the creditors, (ii) if it is approved by ordinary creditors only,
the extraordinary creditors receive favorable treatment, and (iii) no class of creditors may receive or retain more
than the total amount of its claims or interests. The homologation of the reorganization plan renders the plan
binding on all creditors.

The judicial reorganization which pursues the transfer of the assets or activities of the Luxembourg

Obligor may be requested either by the Luxembourg Obligor, the public prosecutor, a creditor or any interested
party (under certain conditions). The court that grants such request for a transfer of the Luxembourg Obligor’s
assets or activities appoints an expert (mandataire de justice) to organize and carry out the said transfer in order
to ensure the continuity of the business.

The law of 5 August 2005 on financial collateral arrangements (the **“Collateral Law”) implemented**

Directive 2002/47/EC of 6 June 2002 on financial collateral arrangements into Luxembourg law. It provides a
high degree of protection to creditors who benefit from financial collateral (e.g. pledge or transfer of title for
security purposes) in the event of insolvency proceedings or reorganization measures. This protection has been
confirmed over time by the Luxembourg courts.

The Restructuring Law has not amended the Collateral Law. Collateral arrangements created under the

Collateral Law (“Collateral Arrangements”), such as pledges over claims or over shares in a Luxembourg
company remain, in principle, enforceable despite the opening of any insolvency proceedings, including any
reorganization proceedings under the Restructuring Law.

In very limited cases, i.e. where (i) the parties have commercially agreed that an enforcement requires an

acceleration of the secured debt and (ii) judicial reorganisation proceedings under the Restructuring Law have
been opened in respect of the Luxembourg Obligor, the relevant creditors may, under certain circumstances, be
temporarily suspended from accelerating the secured debt in accordance with Article 30 of the Restructuring Law
and hence face a situation where enforcing their security rights might be delayed.

**_Suspension of payments proceedings (sursis de paiements)_**

_General administration of a suspension of payments proceedings_

A suspension of payments (sursis de paiements) for commercial companies is different from the sursis

_de paiement proceedings available to banks and insurance companies. It can only be applied to a company which,_
as a result of extraordinary and unforeseeable events, has to temporarily cease its payments but which has on the
basis of its statement of financial position sufficient assets to pay all amounts due to its creditors. The suspension
of payments may also be granted if the situation of the applicant, even though showing a loss, presents serious
elements of reestablishment of the balance between its assets and its debts.

The purpose of the suspension of payments proceedings is to allow a business undertaking experiencing

financial difficulties to suspend its payments for a limited time after a complex proceeding involving both the
Commercial District Court and the _Cour supérieure de justice and the approval by a majority of the creditors_
representing, by their claims, three quarters of the company’s debts (excluding claims secured by privilege
(privilège), mortgage (hypothèque) or pledge (gage)).

The suspension of payments is, however, not for general application, which is one of the main reasons it

has lost its attractiveness. It only applies to those liabilities which have been assumed by the debtor prior to
obtaining the suspension of payment and has no effect as far as taxes and other public charges or secured claims
(by right of privilege, a mortgage or a pledge) are concerned.

**_Effects of suspension of payments proceedings_**

During the suspension of payments, ordinary creditors cannot open enforcement proceedings against the

debtor or the debtor’s assets. This stay on enforcement does not extend to preferred creditors, or to creditors which
are secured by mortgages (hypothèques), pledges (gages) or financial collateral arrangements governed by the
Collateral Act 2005. The debtor continues to manage its own business under the supervision of a court-appointed
administrator who must approve most of the transactions carried out by the debtor.

When a suspension of payments ends, the stay on enforcement is terminated and the debtor’s directors

can run the business again.

**_Judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire)_**

Judicial liquidation proceedings may be opened at the request of the public prosecutor against companies

pursuing an activity violating criminal laws or that are in serious violation of the Luxembourg commercial code
or of the Luxembourg law dated August 10, 1915 on commercial companies, as amended (the Companies
Act 1915).

Based on case law the management of such judicial liquidation proceedings generally follows similar

rules as those applicable to bankruptcy proceedings, even though there can be no absolute certainty in this respect.

**_Effects of opening of Luxembourg insolvency proceedings on security interests governed by the Collateral_**
**_Act 2005_**

The Collateral Act 2005 expressly provides that financial collateral arrangements (including pledges)

including enforcement measures are valid and enforceable against third parties including supervisors, receivers,
liquidators and any other similar persons or bodies irrespective of any bankruptcy, liquidation or other situation,
national or foreign, of composition with creditors or reorganization affecting anyone of the parties.

**_Limitation on enforcement of security interests_**

According to Luxembourg conflict of laws rules, the courts in Luxembourg will generally apply the lex

_rei sitae or lex situs (the law of the place where the assets or subject matter of the security interests (such as a_
pledge) are situated) in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over such assets.

As a consequence, Luxembourg law will apply in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of

pledges over assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, such as registered shares in Luxembourg
companies, bank accounts held with a Luxembourg financial institution, receivables/claims governed by
Luxembourg law and/or having debtors located in Luxembourg, tangible assets located in Luxembourg, securities
which are held through an account located in Luxembourg, bearer securities physically located in Luxembourg,
etc.

The Collateral Act 2005 governs the creation, validity, perfection and enforcement of pledges over shares

(such as registered shares in Luxembourg companies or bearer shares physically located in Luxembourg), bank


-----

accounts and receivables located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Under the Collateral Act 2005, the
perfection of pledges depends on certain registration, notification and acceptance requirements. A share pledge
over registered shares in a Luxembourg company must be (i) acknowledged and accepted by the company which
has issued the shares (subject to the pledge) and/or (ii) registered in the shareholders’ register of such company.
If future shares are pledged, the perfection of such pledge will require additional notification to such company
and/or registration in the shareholders’ register of such company. A pledge under a receivables pledge agreement
will be validly created and perfected provided that the pledge under such receivables pledge agreement is executed
by the parties thereto. However, if the debtor has not been notified of such receivables pledge or if it did not
otherwise acquire knowledge of the pledge, it will be validly discharged of its obligations if it pays the pledgor.
A bank account pledge agreement must be notified to and accepted by the account bank so as to ensure that the
account bank has waived any pre-existing security interests and other rights in respect of the relevant account. If
(future) bank accounts are pledged, such additional notification to, acceptance and waiver by the account bank
will be required. Article 11 of the Collateral Act 2005 sets out enforcement remedies available upon the
occurrence of an enforcement event, including, but not limited to:

##### • appropriation by the pledgee or appropriation by a third party of the pledged assets at a value determined
in accordance with a valuation method agreed upon by the parties;

##### • sell or cause the sale of the pledged assets (i) in a private transaction at normal commercial terms
(conditions commerciales normales), (ii) by a public sale at the stock exchange (if listed shares) or (iii) by
way of a public auction;

##### • court allocation of the pledged assets to the pledgee in discharge of the secured obligations following a
valuation made by a court-appointed expert; or

##### • set-off between the secured obligations and the pledged assets.

As the Collateral Act 2005 does not provide any specific time periods and depending on (i) the method

chosen, (ii) the valuation of the pledged assets, (iii) any possible recourses, and (iv) the possible need to involve
third parties, such as, e.g., courts, stock exchanges and appraisers, the enforcement of the pledges might be
substantially delayed.

The Collateral Act 2005 expressly provides that financial collateral arrangements (including pledges and

transfer of title by way of security) including enforcement measures are valid and enforceable against third parties
including supervisory, receivers, liquidators and any other similar persons or bodies irrespective of any
bankruptcy, liquidation or other situation, national or foreign, of composition with creditors or reorganization
affecting any one of the parties.

Foreign law governed security interests and the powers of any receivers/administrators may not be

enforceable or recognized in respect of assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Security interests/
arrangements, which are not expressly recognized under Luxembourg law and the powers of any
receivers/administrators might not be recognized or enforced by the Luxembourg courts, even over assets located
outside of Luxembourg, in particular where the relevant Luxembourg security provider or Luxembourg guarantor
becomes subject to Luxembourg insolvency proceedings or where the Luxembourg courts otherwise have
jurisdiction because of the actual or deemed location of the relevant rights or assets, except if ‘main insolvency
proceedings’ (as defined in the EU Insolvency Regulation) are opened under Luxembourg law and such security
interests/arrangements constitute rights in rem over assets located in another Member State in which the EU
Insolvency Regulation applies in accordance with article 7 of the EU Insolvency Regulation.

The perfection of the security interests created pursuant to pledge agreements does not prevent any third

party creditor from seeking attachment or execution against the assets, which are subject to the security interests
created under the pledge agreements, in an attempt to satisfy their unpaid claims against the pledgor. Such
attachment or execution will, however, not affect the validity and/or enforceability of the security interests created
under the pledge agreements as such attachment or execution will be inapplicable to such security interests.

Finally, the appointment of a foreign security agent will be recognized under Luxembourg law, (i) to the

extent that the designation is valid under the law governing such appointment and (ii) subject to possible
restrictions. Generally, according to paragraph 2(4) of the Luxembourg Collateral Act 2005, a security (financial
collateral) may be provided in favor of a person acting on behalf of the collateral taker, a fiduciary or a trustee in
order to secure the claims of third party beneficiaries, whether present or future, provided that these third party
beneficiaries are determined or may be determined. Without prejudice to their obligations vis-a-vis third party
beneficiaries of the security, persons acting on behalf of beneficiaries of the security, the fiduciary or the trustee
benefit from the same rights as those of the direct beneficiaries of the security aimed at by such law.


-----

**_Limitation on the Luxembourg Obligor’s Guarantee_**

The Companies Act 1915 does not specifically provide for rules governing the ability of the Luxembourg

Obligor to guarantee the indebtedness of another entity of the same group. Within a group of companies, the
corporate interest (intérêt social) of each individual corporate entity could, to a certain extent, be tempered by,
and subordinated to, the interest of the group. The notion of interest of group is recognized neither by the
Luxembourg law nor by published Luxembourg case law.

A reciprocal assistance from one group company to another does not necessarily conflict with the interest

of the assisting company. However, this assistance must be temporary and in proportion with the real financial
means of the assisting company. The Luxembourg Obligor may give a guarantee provided that the giving of the
guarantee is covered by the company’s corporate objects and is in the best interest of the company. The test
regarding the Luxembourg Obligor’s corporate interest is whether in providing the guarantee does the
Luxembourg Obligor receive some (direct or indirect) consideration in return (such as an economic or commercial
benefit) and whether the benefit is proportional to the burden of the assistance. A guarantee that substantially
exceeds the guarantor company’s ability to meet its obligations to the beneficiary of the guarantee and to its other
creditors would expose its directors or managers (as applicable) to personal liability. Furthermore, under certain
circumstances, the directors or managers (as applicable) of a Luxembourg company might incur criminal penalties
based on the concept of misappropriation or misuse of corporate assets (article 1500-11 of the Companies
Act 1915).

The Guarantees granted by the Luxembourg Obligor, for the obligations of a relevant obligor which is

not a direct or indirect subsidiary of that Luxembourg Obligor, will be limited to a certain percentage of, among
others, the relevant company’s net worth as provided for in the Indenture.

The Guarantee, to the extent it is granted by the Luxembourg Obligor could, if submitted to a

Luxembourg court, depending on the terms of such guarantee, possibly be construed by such court as a suretyship
(cautionnement) and not a demand guarantee or an independent guarantee. Article 2012 of the Luxembourg Civil
Code provides that the validity and the enforceability of a suretyship (which constitutes an accessory obligation)
are subject to the validity of the underlying obligation. It follows that if the Notes were invalid or challenged, it
cannot be excluded that the Luxembourg Obligor would be released from its liabilities under the Guarantee.

**Northern Ireland**

**_General_**

The laws relating to validity and enforceability of security are broadly the same as those in England and

Wales but substantially different from those equivalent laws in Ireland.

**_Fixed versus floating charges_**

There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security created in an Northern Irish law governed

security document has an advantage over floating charge security:

(a) a fixed charge, even if created after the date of a floating charge, may have priority as against
the floating charge over the charged assets;

(b) until the floating charge security crystallizes, a company is entitled to deal with assets that are
subject to floating charge security in the ordinary course of business, meaning that such assets
can be effectively disposed of by the charging company so as to give a third party good title to
the assets free of the floating charge and so as to give rise to the risk of security being granted
over such assets in priority to the floating charge security;

(c) there are particular challenge risks in relation to floating charge security; and

(d) floating charge security is subject to the claims of preferential creditors (such as occupational
pension scheme contributions and salaries owed to employees) and to ring-fencing of the
Prescribed Part (see “—Priority of Claims”).

Under Northern Irish law, there is a possibility that a court could find that the fixed security interests

expressed to be fixed charges created by a security document could take effect as floating charges – this is because
the description given to them as fixed charges within the security document is not determinative. Whether the
purported fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating security interests
will depend, among other things, on whether the chargee has the requisite degree of control over the ability of the
relevant chargor to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised


-----

by the holder of the security in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the assets that are subject of a
purported fixed charge in its discretion without the consent of the chargee, the court would be likely to hold that
the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed
charge. If a fixed security interest is recharacterized as a floating charge, this will, among other things, adversely
impact the returns of the holder of the charge in an administration, liquidation or administrative receivership (see
_“—Priority of Claims”) and prevent the holder relying on that charge to appoint a receiver._

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

The Issuer is a company organized under the laws of Ireland and some of the Guarantors are companies

organized under the laws of Ireland, Jersey and Luxembourg. All of their directors and executive officers are nonresidents of the United States, and substantially all of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ assets and those of such
persons are located outside the United States. Although the Issuer and the Guarantors will appoint an agent for
service of process in the United States and will submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York,
in each case in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may not be able to effect service of
process on such persons or the Issuer or the Guarantors within the United States in any action, including actions
predicated on civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal and state securities laws or other laws.

**England and Wales**

The United States and United Kingdom currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal

recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters.
Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on
civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be
recognized or enforceable in England. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England, proceedings must
first be initiated by way of an action on the judgment debt before a court of competent jurisdiction in England. In
such an action, the English court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by
the U.S. court (subject to what is stated below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on
such a claim (assuming that the defense to it has no real prospect of success and there is no other compelling
reason for a trial). Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by an English court in such an action is
conditional upon (among other things) the following:

##### • the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English conflicts of
laws principles;

##### • the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in
the court which pronounced it and being for a debt for a definite sum of money;

##### • the U.S. judgment not contravening English public policy or statute;

 • the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of tax, or other charges of a like nature in
respect of a penalty or fine;

##### • the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum
assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained and not being otherwise in breach of
Section 5 of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980;

##### • the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural justice
or in breach of the principles of the European Convention on Human Rights (to the extent applicable);

##### • judgment is not given in proceedings brought in breach of an agreement for settlement of disputes;

 • there not having been a prior inconsistent decision of an English court between the same parties; and

 • the English enforcement proceedings being commenced within the relevant limitation period.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in England judgments in civil and commercial

matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that
those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in England. In addition, it is questionable whether an English
court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in England, instead
of the United States, and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.

**Ireland**

As the United States is not a party to a convention with Ireland in respect of the enforcement of

judgments, common law rules apply in order to determine whether a judgment of the courts of the State of New
York is enforceable in Ireland. A judgment of the courts of the State of New York will be enforced by the courts
of Ireland if the following general requirements are met:


-----

##### • the courts of the State of New York must have had jurisdiction in relation to the particular defendant;
according to Irish conflict of law rules (the submission to jurisdiction by the defendant would satisfy this
rule); and

##### • the judgment must be final and conclusive and the decree must be final and unalterable in the court which
pronounces it. A judgment can be final and conclusive even if it is subject to appeal or even if an appeal
is pending. Where however the effect of lodging an appeal under the applicable law is to stay execution
of the judgment, it is possible that in the meantime the judgment should not be actionable in Ireland. It
remains to be determined whether final judgment given in default of appearance is final and conclusive.

However, Irish courts may refuse to enforce a judgment of the courts of the State of New York which

meets the above requirements for one of the following reasons:

##### • if the judgment is not for a definite sum of money;

 • if the judgment was obtained by fraud;

 • the enforcement of the judgment in Ireland would be contrary to natural or constitutional justice;

 • the judgment is contrary to Irish public policy or involves certain United States laws which will not be
enforced in Ireland; or

##### • jurisdiction cannot be obtained by the Irish courts over the judgment debtors in the enforcement
proceedings by personal service Ireland or outside Ireland under Order 11 of the Superior Courts Rules.

**Jersey**

The following summary with respect to the enforceability of certain U.S. court judgments in Jersey is

based upon advice provided to us by Jersey legal advisors. The United States and Jersey currently do not have a
treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards)
in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state
court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities
laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in Jersey. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment
in Jersey, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in Jersey. In such an action,
a Jersey court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject
to what is said below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming
that there is no good defense to it). Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by a Jersey court in such an
action is conditional upon (among other things) the following:

##### • the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to Jersey conflicts of laws
principles;

##### • the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in
the court which pronounced it and being for a debt or definite sum of money (although there are
circumstances where non-money judgments may also be recognized);

##### • the recognition or enforcement of the U.S. judgment not contravening Jersey public policy;

 • the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, or in
respect of a penalty or fine;

##### • the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum
assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained and not being otherwise in breach of
Section 5 of the United Kingdom Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 (as extended to Jersey by the
Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 (Jersey) Order 1983);

##### • the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of Jersey principles of natural justice
or rights under the European Convention on Human Rights; and

##### • there not having been a prior inconsistent decision of a Jersey court in respect of the same matter.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in Jersey judgments in civil and commercial

matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, there can be no assurance that those


-----

judgments will be recognized or enforceable in Jersey. In addition, it is questionable whether a Jersey court would
accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in Jersey, instead of the United
States, and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.

**Luxembourg**

Our Luxembourg counsel has advised us that the United States and Luxembourg are not currently bound

by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered
in civil and commercial matters. According to such counsel, a valid and enforceable judgment for the payment of
monies rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon
the U.S. securities laws, would not directly be enforceable in Luxembourg. Notwithstanding, a party who received
such favorable judgment in a U.S. court may initiate enforcement proceedings in Luxembourg (exequatur) by
requesting enforcement of the U.S. judgment by the District Court (Tribunal d’Arrondissement) pursuant to
Section 678 of the New Luxembourg Code of Civil Procedure. The District Court will authorize the enforcement
in Luxembourg of the U.S. judgment if it is satisfied that all of the following conditions are met:

##### • the U.S. judgment is enforceable (exécutoire) in the United States;

 • the U.S. court awarding the judgment has jurisdiction to adjudicate the respective matter under applicable
U.S. federal or state jurisdictions rules, and the jurisdiction of the U.S. court is recognized by
Luxembourg private international and local law;

##### • the U.S. court has applied to the dispute the substantive law which would have been applied by
Luxembourg courts under the applicable conflict of law rules;

##### • the U.S. judgment does not contravene international public policy or order as understood under the laws
of Luxembourg or has been given in proceedings of a criminal nature and tax nature;

##### • the U.S. court has acted in accordance with its own procedural laws;

 • the U.S. judgment was granted following proceedings where the counterparty had the opportunity to
appear, was granted the necessary time to prepare its case and, if it appeared, to present a defense; and

##### • the U.S. judgment was not granted pursuant to an evasion of Luxembourg law (fraude à la loi
_luxembourgeoise)._

Subject to the above conditions, Luxembourg courts tend not to review the merits of a foreign judgment,

although there is no statutory prohibition for such review. If an original action is brought in Luxembourg,
Luxembourg courts may refuse to enforce any choice of law provisions if the application of such law would
contravene, or is manifestly incompatible with, Luxembourg public policy. Further, in the event of any
proceedings being brought in a Luxembourg court in respect of a monetary obligation expressed to be payable in
a currency other than euro, a Luxembourg court would have power to give judgment expressed as an order to pay
a currency other than euro. Notwithstanding, enforcement of the judgment against any party in Luxembourg would
be available only in euro and for such purposes all claims or debts would be converted into euro. Even if a U.S.
judgment is recognized in Luxembourg, it does not necessarily mean that it will be enforced in all circumstances.
The obligations need to be of a specific kind and type for which an enforcement procedure exists under
Luxembourg law. Also, if circumstances have arisen after the date at which such foreign judgment became legally
effective and final, a defense against execution may arise. Enforcement is also subject to the effect of any
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation, moratorium as well as other similar laws affecting
creditor’s rights generally.

Moreover, a Luxembourg court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize

damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. In addition, it is
doubtful whether a Luxembourg court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action
predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.

The group has adopted an income statement format which seeks to highlight significant items within group results for the period. The
group believe that this presentation provides additional analysis as it highlights significant or one-off items. Judgement is used by the
group in assessing the particular items, which by virtue of their scale and nature are disclosed in the group income statement and related
notes as exceptional items.

The group included an exceptional charge of €1 million (31 March 2023: €4 million) for restructuring programme costs in respect of staff
that had committed to exiting the business in the period ended 31 March 2024.

No provision has been included in respect of future staff exits not committed at 31 March 2024, and any further costs will be charged to
the income statement and impact cash flows in future periods.

**_Other exceptional items_**
During the period ended 31 March 2024, the group recognised an exceptional charge of €1 million (31 March 2023: €Nil) in respect of
legal and other related matters.

In March 2024, the group completed an amendment and extension of €600 million of its Facility B borrowings to May 2029. The

statement as discount on amendment and extension of borrowings.

borrowings of €546 million are subject to cash-pay interest at EURIBOR plus 3.25% margin.

The amendment and extension of the existing borrowings was accounted for as a modification of the existing financial liability for the

**13.** **Post Balance Sheet Events**

There have been no significant events affecting the group since the period ended 31 March 2024.

**14.** **Contingent liabilities**

There have been no material changes in our contingent liabilities since the publication of the financial statements of EHIL in the
bondholder’s report for the year ended 31 December 2023.

**15.** **Guarantees**

There have been no material changes in our credit guarantees since the publication of the financial statements of EHIL in the bondholder’s
report for the year ended 31 December 2023.

**16.** **Seasonality**

_Fixed line_
The group does not believe that seasonality has a material impact on our fixed line business.

_Mobile_
The group’s mobile business tends to experience an increase in sales volumes in the weeks approaching Christmas due to the seasonal
nature of its retail business. The group’s mobile business experiences significant postpay and prepay subscriber growth and related costs
of handset subsidies and commissions in November and December. Visitor roaming revenues are also seasonally significant because Ireland
is a popular tourist destination during the summer months.

**17.** **Commitments**

The group’s capital contractual obligations and commitment payments were €111 million at 31 March 2024 (31 December 2023: €60
million).

**18.** **Related party transactions**

There have been no material changes in our related party transactions since the publication of the financial statements of EHIL in the
bondholder’s report for the year ended 31 December 2023.

# Independent auditor’s report to the members of eircom Holdings (Ireland) Limited and its subsidiaries

Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of eircom Holdings (Ireland) Limited (‘the Company’) and its subsidiaries (‘the Group’),
which comprise the Group Income Statement, the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Group and Company
Balance Sheet, the Group and Company Cash Flow Statement and the Group and Company Statement of Changes in Equity for
the financial year ended 31 December 2023, and the related notes to the financial statements, including the summary of significant
accounting policies.

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is Irish law and International Financial Reporting
Standards as adopted by the European Union.

In our opinion, the Group and Company’s financial statements:

###### • give a true and fair view in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in Ireland of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the Group and the Company as at 31 December 2023 and of the financial performance of the Group and cash flows of the Group and the Company for the financial year then ended; and

 • have been properly prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2014.

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (Ireland) (‘ISAs (Ireland)) and applicable law.
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the ‘Responsibilities of the auditor for the audit of the financial
statements’ Section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are
relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Ireland, including the Ethical Standard for Auditors (Ireland) issued by the
Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority (IAASA), and the ethical pronouncements established by Chartered
Accountants Ireland, applied as determined to be appropriate in the circumstances for the Group and the Company. We have
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of going concern basis of accounting in the
preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that,
individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Company and the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern
for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant Sections
of this report.

# Independent auditor’s report to the members of eircom Holdings (Ireland) Limited and its subsidiaries

Other matter
The financial statements of the Group and the Company for the year ended 31 December 2022, were audited by Ernst & Young,
Chartered Accountants and Statutory Audit Firm, who expressed an unmodified opinion on those statements on 20 March 2023.

Other information
Other information comprises information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and the auditor’s
report thereon, including the Directors’ Report. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the
financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we
do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so,
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the
audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies in the financial statements, we
are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the
other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other
information; we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

Matters on which we are required to report by the Companies Act 2014

###### • We have obtained all the information and explanations which we consider necessary for the purposes of our audit.

 • In our opinion the accounting records of the Group were sufficient to permit the financial statements to be readily and properly audited.

 • The financial statements are in agreement with the accounting records.

 • In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements. Based solely on the work undertaken in the course of our audit, in our opinion, the Directors’ Report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2014.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Based on our knowledge and understanding of the Group and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not
identified material misstatements in the Directors’ Report.

Under the Companies Act 2014 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, the disclosures of directors’ remuneration
and transactions specified by Sections 305 to 312 of the Act have not been made. We have no exceptions to report arising from
this responsibility.

# Independent auditor’s report to the members of eircom Holdings (Ireland) Limited and its subsidiaries

Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement, management is responsible for the preparation of the financial
statements which give a true and fair view in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, and for such internal
control as they determine necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group and the Company’s ability to continue
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting
unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.

Responsibilities of the auditor for the audit of the financial statements
The objectives of an auditor are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (Ireland) will always
detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if,
individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the
basis of these financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Irish Auditing and
Accounting Supervisory Authority’s website at: [http://www.iaasa.ie/getmedia/b2389013-1cf6-458b-9b8f-](http://www.iaasa.ie/getmedia/b2389013-1cf6-458b-9b8f-a98202dc9c3a/Description_of_auditors_responsibilities_for_audit.pdf)

##### Notes to the Financial Statements
_For the Year Ended 31 December 2023_

**1.** **General information**

eircom Holdings (Ireland) Limited (‘the company’) and its subsidiaries together (“the group” or “eircom Holdings (Ireland) Limited
group” or “EHIL Group”), provide fixed line and mobile telecommunications services in Ireland.

eircom Holdings (Ireland) Limited is incorporated as a company limited by shares in Ireland, under the registered number 512352. The
address of its registered office is 2 Heuston South Quarter, St. John’s Road West, Dublin 8, Ireland. The company was incorporated on
23 April 2012. The company holds 100% of the issued share capital of two principal subsidiaries: eircom Finco Sarl and eircom Limited.
eircom Finco Sarl, a company registered in Luxembourg, was incorporated on 24 May 2012.

On 11 June 2012, the company acquired 100% of the issued share capital of eircom Limited for €1.00 pursuant to a Scheme of
Arrangement approved by the Irish High Court. The principal trading activities of the group are undertaken by eircom Limited and its
subsidiaries. eircom Limited is the incumbent telecommunications operator in Ireland.

NJJ Holding SAS France, a company registered in France, is the ultimate holding company. Xavier Niel is the ultimate controlling party.
Wexford Limited, a company registered in Jersey, is the immediate holding company.

**2.** **Going concern**

The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis.

The Directors believe that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for the financial statements notwithstanding
the net liability position of the group, as the Directors believe that based on the group’s forecast of operational cash flows, and trading
results, the group will be in a position to meet its obligations as they fall due for the foreseeable future. The net liabilities of the group,
included in the balance sheet at 31 December 2023, include liabilities of €2,794 million in respect of borrowings which are measured at
amortised cost, and the earliest date borrowings are due is 1 November 2024 for the €222 million 1.75% Senior Secured Notes. See Note
28 Borrowings for further information.

Having made due enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the group and the company will continue in operational
existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial
statements.

**3.** **Accounting policies**

The significant accounting policies adopted by the group and company are set out below.

**3.1.** **Basis of preparation**
The entity and consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU) and those parts of the Companies Act 2014 applicable to companies reporting under
IFRS.

The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis (see Note 2). A summary of the more important accounting
policies is set out below.

The financial statements, which are presented in euro, the group rounded to the nearest million and the company in euro, have been
prepared under the historical cost convention except for the following:

- certain assets and liabilities measured at fair value upon acquisition;

- derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value; and

- pension obligations are measured at the present value of the future estimated cash flows related to benefits earned and pension assets
are valued at fair value.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS as adopted by the EU requires the use of estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the amount, event or
actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or
areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed throughout the Notes.

##### Notes to the Financial Statements
_For the Year Ended 31 December 2023_

**3.** **Accounting policies – continued**

**3.1.** **Basis of preparation**

_Standards, amendments and interpretations effective for the year ended 31 December 2023_
There were no standards, amendments or interpretations effective for the year ended 31 December 2023 that had a material impact on
the consolidated financial statements of the group. The group has not early adopted any standards, amendments or interpretations that
have been issued but are not yet effective for the year ended 31 December 2023.

**3.2.** **Basis of consolidation**
The consolidated financial statements of the group comprise a consolidation of the financial statements of the company, eircom Holdings
(Ireland) Limited, and its subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures. The subsidiaries’ and joint venture’s financial period ends are all
coterminous with those of the company included in the financial statements.

(i) _Subsidiaries_
Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the group has control. The group controls an entity
when the group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to
affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is
transferred to the group. All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to
transactions between members of the group are eliminated in full on consolidation. Subsidiaries are deconsolidated from
the group from the date that control ceases. If the group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the related assets
(including goodwill), liabilities, non-controlling interest and other components of equity, while any resultant gain or loss is
recognised in profit or loss. Any investment retained is recognised at fair value.

(ii) _Joint arrangements_
Under IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’ investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures. The
classification depends on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor, rather than the legal structure of the joint arrangement.

The group held 56% of the equity share capital in Tetra Ireland Communications Limited (“Tetra”). However, the group’s interest in
Tetra was subject to a contractual agreement with other shareholders, which prevented the group from exercising a majority of voting
rights in key strategic, operational and financial decision-making. Accordingly, the group’s interest was accounted for as a joint venture
in accordance with IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’. On 23 March 2022, the group sold its joint venture Tetra Ireland Communications
Limited.

The group’s interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, after initially being recognised at cost in the consolidated
balance sheet. The group’s share of joint ventures post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in the income statement, and its share
of post-acquisition movements in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income. The cumulative postacquisition movements are recorded against the carrying amount of the investment. Dividends received or receivable from joint ventures
are recognised as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment.

When the group’s share of losses in a joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the joint venture, including any other unsecured
receivables, the group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture.

Unrealised gains on transactions between the group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the group’s interest in these
entities. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Accounting policies of joint ventures have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the group.

(iii) _Acquisitions_
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for all business combinations, except for business combinations involving entities
under common control and group reorganisations. Under the purchase method of accounting, the cost of the acquisition is measured at
the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by
the group in exchange for control of the acquiree. The acquiree’s identifiable assets and liabilities are recognised at their fair values at
the acquisition date. Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost
of the business combination over the net fair value of the group’s share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities
recognised. The interest of non-controlling interest shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at the non-controlling interest’s
proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised, and does not include a gross-up for goodwill.
The results of subsidiaries acquired during the period are brought into the consolidated financial statements from the date control transfers
to the group. There were no acquisitions in the years ended 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022.

_(iv)_ _Disposals_
The results of businesses sold during the period are included in the consolidated financial statements for the period up to the date control
ceases. Gains or losses on disposal are calculated as the difference between the sale proceeds (net of expenses) and the net assets
attributable to the interest which has been sold.

**3. Accounting policies - continued**

**3.2.** **Basis of consolidation**
_(v)_ _Acquisitions involving entities under common control_
Business combinations involving entities under common control are not required to be accounted for using the purchase accounting
method under IFRS. The group instead applies the predecessor accounting method for such transactions. Under the predecessor
accounting method, which is also commonly referred to as the merger accounting method, the assets and liabilities acquired are
recognised at the acquisition date at the carrying values stated in the consolidated financial statements of the highest entity which has
common control for which consolidated financial statements are prepared. The goodwill recognised is limited to the goodwill previously
recognised in the consolidated financial statements of the highest entity which has common control. The difference between the
consideration and the net assets recognised at predecessor value is charged/credited to the merger reserve, in equity. The results of
subsidiaries acquired during the period are brought into the consolidated financial statements from the date control transfers to the group.

**3.3.** **Goodwill**
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the group’s share of the net identifiable assets, liabilities
and contingent liabilities recognised of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is
included in ‘intangible assets - goodwill’.

Goodwill is not amortised. Instead, goodwill is tested for impairment annually and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Impairment losses on goodwill may not be reversed in any circumstances.

Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units for the purpose of impairment testing in accordance with IAS 36 “Impairment of Assets”.
The allocation is made to cash generating units or groups of cash generating units that are expected to benefit from the business
combination in which the goodwill arose, identified according to operating segment. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount
by which the cash generating unit’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s
fair value less costs to sell and value in use. These calculations require the use of estimates, including management’s expectations of
future revenue, operating costs, profit margins and capital requirements for each cash generating unit.

Gains and losses on the disposal of a cash generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated include the carrying amount of goodwill
relating to the entity sold.

**3.4.** **Other intangible assets**
Acquired computer software licences and associated costs are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use
the specific software. IT development costs include only those costs directly attributable to the development phase and are only capitalised
following completion of a technical feasibility study and where the group has an intention and ability to use the asset which will contribute
future period financial benefits through revenue generation and/or cost reduction. Internal costs associated with developing computer
software programmes are also capitalised on the same basis. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives (three to four
years). Costs associated with the upgrade of computer software programmes which increase the functionality of computer software or
related assets are capitalised.

Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred.

Licence fees paid to the government, which permit telecommunications activities to be operated for defined periods, are initially recorded
at cost and amortised from the time the network is available for use to the end of the licence period.

Other intangible assets, which comprise primarily of acquired intangible assets, are capitalised at fair value and amortised using the
straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, from the date the intangible assets are available for use.

The following useful lives have been assigned to intangible assets:

**Years**


Computer software

Intangible assets from acquisitions:


4


Trademark (Fixed) 5

Contracts and related customer relationships (Fixed) 14

Mobile licences 15 – 18.5 [(1)]

(1) Spectrum licences are amortised over the term of the relevant licences.

Intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 “Impairment of Assets” in the same
manner as goodwill (see 3.3 above).

**3. Accounting policies - continued**

**3.5.** **Segmental reporting**
An operating segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products or services that are subject to risks and returns
that are different from those of other operating segments. Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal
reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources
and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Senior Management Team, which is the key management
team that makes strategic decisions.

**3.6.** **Revenue recognition**
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, as separate performance obligations, for the sale of
goods and services in the ordinary course of the group’s activities. Amounts disclosed as revenue are net of discounts and value added
tax. Revenue includes sales by group entities but excludes all inter-company sales.

If the group has control of goods or services when they are delivered to a customer, then the group is the principal in the sale to the
customer; otherwise the group is acting as an agent. Whether the group is considered to be the principal or an agent in the transaction
depends on analysis by management of both the legal form and substance of the agreement between the group and its business partners;
such judgements impact the amount of reported revenue and operating expenses.

The group determines the transaction price to which it expects to be entitled in return for providing the promised obligations to the
customer based on the committed contractual amounts, net of sales taxes and discounts. Where indirect channel dealers, such as retailers,
acquire customer contracts on behalf of the group and receive commission, any commissions that the dealer is compelled to use to fund
discounts or other incentives to the customer are treated as payments to the customer when determining the transaction price and
consequently are not included in contract acquisition costs. The group’s contracts are structured in such a way that there is little or no
variable consideration.

Revenue is recognised when goods and services are delivered to customers; goods and services may be delivered to a customer at different
times under the same contract, hence it is necessary to allocate the amount payable by the customer between goods and services. The
group has used a relative standalone selling price basis to ascertain the goods element of the contract and this requires the identification
of performance obligations, which is discussed below.

It is necessary to estimate the standalone price when the group does not sell equivalent goods or services in similar circumstances on a
standalone basis. Where possible, the group observes the standalone prices for similar goods and services making up the total contract
price, which is the typically the case for handsets. A cost-plus reasonable margin approach is applied to arrive at the Recommended
Retail Price (‘RRP’) for prepaid handsets, hence this value is used as the standalone price of the handset for postpay contracts. A dual
validation is performed by which the service element of the contract is reviewed against a sim-only service offering. The group maximises
the use of external inputs to assess the reasonableness of the standalone selling prices by observing the standalone prices for similar
goods and services when sold by third parties.

Customers typically pay upfront for handsets, in advance for prepay and monthly for postpay and other communication services. Where
the customer pays a value less than that of the RRP of the handset upfront, the balance is deemed to be paid over the term of the related
service agreement. When revenue recognised in respect of a customer contract exceeds amounts received or receivable from a customer
at that time a contract asset is recognised; contract assets will typically be recognised for handsets or other equipment provided to
customers where payment is recovered by the group via future service fees. If amounts received or receivable from a customer exceed
revenue recognised for a contract, for example if the group receives an advance payment from a customer, a contract liability is
recognised. When contract assets or liabilities are recognised, a financing component may exist in the contract. The group avails of a
practical expedient to exclude significant financing on the basis that the amounts are immaterial, arising from an assessment which was
carried out on handsets, contract duration and interest rates on the open market.

These handset values are recognised upfront since ownership of the handset passes to the customer on date of inception of the contract
and the values are then amortised against the service revenue component of the bundle delivered over the contract period. There is not
considered to be a significant risk of material adjustment to the carrying value of contract-related assets or liabilities in the 12 months
after the balance sheet date if these estimates were revised. The group avails of practical expedients to exclude contracts of duration of
12 months or less, as almost all contracts are of 18 and 24 month duration.

Impairment losses are calculated separately from other expected credit loss provisions under IFRS 9 – churn is reviewed on an annual
basis and these percentages are built into the contract asset valuation model so that losses are written off immediately and not capitalised
to the balance sheet.

The group is required to interconnect its networks with other telecommunications operators. In some instances, as is normal practice in
the telecommunications industry, reliance is placed on other operators to measure the traffic flows interconnecting with the group’s
networks. The prices at which services are charged are regulated and can be subject to retrospective adjustment. Revenue from
interconnect fees is recognised at the time the services are performed.

_For the Year Ended 31 December 2023_

**3.** **Accounting policies - continued**

**3.6.** **Revenue recognition - continued**
Fixed line revenue is recognised in the period earned by rendering of services or delivery of products. Fixed line revenues largely
comprise access, voice traffic, data services and managed services. Traffic revenue is recognised at the time the traffic is carried over
the group’s networks and revenue from rentals is recognised evenly over the period to which the charges relate and over the life of the
contract. Billings for fixed telephony services are made on a monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly basis. Mobile revenue consists principally
of charges to customers for traffic from mobile network services, revenue from providing network services to other telecommunications
operators, and the sale of handsets and other accessories. Payment terms are typically 14 days from invoice date and 30 days for business
customers. Unbilled revenues from the billing cycle date to the end of each month are recognised as revenue during the month the service
is provided.

Where Customer Premises Equipment (‘CPE’) is part of the bundled revenue – an assessment is undertaken to attach a market value to
the equipment provided. In the case of modems, the life of the equipment is deemed to be 5 years which spans multiple customer
contracts, which are 12 months in duration, and therefore immaterial. Modems are returned at the end of the customer contract, with a
charge levied on customers who do not adhere. These are refurbished on return at minimum cost and re-issued to a new customer. In the
case of TV set top boxes, there is no market value as the provider is contractually obliged not to provide the software necessary to an end
customer to enable them to use this equipment with any other provider’s service other than the group’s.

Bundled products (broadband, line rentals and traffic) are accounted for in the same manner as the unbundled products comprising the
bundle. Revenue from the sale of bundled service products is allocated to the separate elements of the bundle on the basis of each
element’s relative stand-alone selling price basis as described above and recognised in revenue when each individual element of the
product or service is provided. The fair values of each element are determined based on the current market price of the service when sold
separately. Additionally, when allocating the bundled revenue to each element, amounts contingent upon provision of future service are
not allocated to delivered elements. To the extent that there is a discount in the bundled product, such discount is allocated between the
elements of the contract in such a manner as to reflect the fair value of each element and is embedded in a reduced price to the customer.

Revenue arising from the provision of other services, including maintenance contracts, data hosting and other related professional
services, is recognised over the term of the contract.

Revenue arising from the provision of build to suit services of mast sites is recognised when eir fulfills its contractual obligations and
the assets are live and acceptance from the counterparty has occurred.

Refunds and credits are recorded in the period to which they relate as a deduction to revenue, but are limited and infrequent in nature
since eligible return periods are short and under strict criteria, for example faulty handsets within a 14 day period. Warranties are provided
to the customer by the manufacturer, hence there is no exposure to the group.

When costs directly relating to a specific contract are incurred prior to recognising revenue for a related obligation, these costs are
recognised in the income statement as expenses in line with the recognition of revenue when the related obligation is delivered, over the
life of the contract. The costs of acquiring a contract including commission payable for acquiring customers on behalf of the group, are
recognised as contract acquisition cost assets as prepaid and deferred.

**3.7.** **Exceptional items**
The group has adopted an income statement format which seeks to highlight significant or one-off items within group results for the year.
The group believe that this presentation provides additional analysis as it highlights significant or one-off items. Such items include
restructuring costs, curtailment gains and losses in respect of pensions, charges in respect of certain management performance related
bonuses, impairment of assets (including goodwill), gains/losses on exit from subsidiary, onerous contracts and
reinstatement/dilapidation provisions. Judgement is used by the group in assessing the particular items, which, by virtue of their scale
and nature, are disclosed in the group income statement and related notes as exceptional items.

**3.8.** **Amounts paid and payable to other operators**
Amounts paid and payable to other operators are mainly settlement fees that the group pays to other telecommunications operators for
traffic that is routed on their networks. Costs associated with these payments are recognised in the period in which the traffic is carried.

**3.9.** **Customer acquisition costs**
The group pays commissions to dealers for the acquisition and retention of mobile subscribers and certain fixed line products. Customer
acquisition costs are recorded as an asset and amortised either as an expense or a reduction to revenue depending on handset value, over
the period of the relevant contracts under IFRS 15.

The cost of mobile handsets is recorded as an expense in the period of purchase.

The costs associated with the group’s advertising and marketing activities are expensed as incurred.

**3.10.** **Foreign currencies**
_Functional and presentation currency_
Items included in the financial statements of each of the group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic
environment in which the entities operate (‘the functional currency’). These consolidated financial statements are presented in euro,
which is the group’s presentation currency and is denoted by the symbol “€”.

_Transactions and balances_
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the retranslation at periodend exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except
when deferred in the statement of other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges.

_Group entities_
The results and financial position of all the group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are
translated into the presentation currency as follows:

- assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;

- income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable
approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are
translated at the dates of the transactions); and

- all resulting exchange differences are recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income.

**3.11.** **Taxation**
The company is managed and controlled in Ireland and, consequently, is tax resident in Ireland.

Current tax is calculated on the profits of the period. Current tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) in effect during the relevant
financial period.

Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities
and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, if the deferred tax arises from initial recognition of an
asset or liability in a transaction, other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor
taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted, or substantively
enacted by the balance sheet date, and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is
settled.

Deferred tax is recognised in other comprehensive income, if the tax relates to items that are credited or charged, in the same or a different
period, in other comprehensive income.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary
differences can be utilised.

**3.12.** **Financial instruments**
_(i)_ _Borrowings_
All borrowings are initially stated at the fair value of the consideration received after deduction of transaction costs. Borrowings are
subsequently stated at amortised cost. Any difference between the fair value on initial recognition and the redemption value is recognised
in the income statement over the period of borrowings using the effective interest method. When it is not possible to estimate reliably
the cash flows or the expected life of a financial instrument (or group of financial instruments), the group uses the contractual cash flows
over the full contractual term of the financial instrument (or group of financial instruments).

Where the terms of borrowings are amended, if the revised terms are substantially different from the original terms, the transaction is
accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability. The terms are
considered to be substantially different if the discounted present value of the cash flows under the new terms, including any fees paid net
of any fees received and discounted using the original effective interest rate, is at least 10% different from the discounted present value
of the remaining cash flows of the original financial liability. Any gain or loss on the extinguishment of the original liability is recognised
immediately in the income statement.

If the new terms are not substantially different from the original terms, the impact of the change in the cash flows on the financial liability
are recognised immediately in the income statement. The modification gain or loss is equal to the difference between the present value
of the cash flows under the original and modified terms discounted at the original effective interest rate. The carrying value of the financial
liability is adjusted for the modification gain or loss recognised immediately in the income statement and the effective interest rate is
revised to amortise the carrying value of the financial liability after modification over the modified liability revised contractual period.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities, unless the group has an unconditional right to defer settlement for the liability for at least
12 months from the balance sheet date.

_(ii)_ _Financial assets at amortised cost_
Financial assets at amortised cost are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active
market. They are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost and are included in current assets, except
for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. The group’s financial assets at amortised cost are set out in
Note 27.

_(iii)_ _Derivative financial instruments_
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their
fair value at each subsequent balance sheet date. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative
is designated as a hedging instrument, and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The group designates certain derivatives as hedges
of a particular risk associated with a recognised liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge).

The group documents, at the inception of the transaction, the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its
risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception
of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists
between the hedged item and hedging instrument. A hedge ratio of one to one is established.

Derivative assets or liabilities are presented as current or non-current based on expected realisation or settlement dates.

_(iv)_ _Cash flow hedges_
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a
highly probable transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised in other
comprehensive income. Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised in the income statement.

Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement within finance costs in the periods when the hedged item affects
profit or loss. The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of interest rate swaps hedging variable rate borrowings is recognised in
the income statement within finance costs.

When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain
or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the
income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was recorded in equity is
immediately transferred to the income statement.

**3.** **Accounting policies - continued**

**3.13.** **Property, plant and equipment**
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost in the case of
network plant includes contractors’ charges, materials and labour and related overheads directly attributable to the cost of construction.

_Depreciation_
Depreciation is provided on property, plant and equipment (excluding land), on a straight-line basis, so as to write off their cost less
residual amounts over their estimated economic lives, from the date the asset is available for use. The estimated economic lives assigned
to property, plant and equipment are as follows:

**Asset Class** **Estimated**

**Economic**

**Life (Years)**


**Buildings**

**Network Plant**

**Transmission Equipment**

Duct
Overhead cable/poles
Underground cable

Other local network


40

20

8-15

14

3.5-15


**Others** 3-16

The group’s policy is to review the remaining economic lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment on an ongoing basis
and to adjust the depreciation charge prospectively to reflect the remaining estimated life and residual value.

Fully depreciated property, plant and equipment are retained in the cost of property, plant and equipment and related accumulated
depreciation until they are removed from service. In the case of disposals, cost of assets and related accumulated depreciation are removed
from the financial statements and the net amount, less proceeds from disposal, is charged or credited to the income statement.

_Assets in the course of construction_
Assets in the course of construction represent the cost of purchasing, constructing and installing property, plant and equipment ahead of
their own productive use. No depreciation is charged on assets in the course of construction. The estimated amount of interest incurred,
directly attributable to constructing qualifying assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use,
is capitalised based on the weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings.

_Asset retirement obligations_
The group has certain obligations in relation to the retirement of assets, mainly poles, batteries and international cable. The group also
has obligations to dismantle base stations and to restore the property owned by third parties on which the stations are situated after the
stations are removed. The group capitalises the discounted future cash flows associated with these asset retirement obligations and
depreciates these assets over the useful life of the related asset.

**3.14.** **Impairment of non financial assets – group**
Assets that have an indefinite useful life, principally goodwill, and intangible assets not yet available for use, are not subject to
amortisation, and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation and depreciation are reviewed for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable
amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are
grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). If a cash generating unit is
impaired, provision is made to reduce the carrying amount of the related assets to their estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses
are allocated firstly against goodwill and secondly against the other assets (including other intangible assets) in the cash generating unit
on a pro-rata basis based on the carrying amount of each asset in the cash generating unit.

Non financial assets, other than goodwill, that suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each
reporting date. Impairment losses recognised in respect of goodwill are not reversed in any circumstances.

**3.15.** **Leased assets**
The group assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the right to control the
use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

_Where the group is lessee_
The group applies lease accounting under IFRS 16 for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low value assets. The group
recognises lease liabilities to make lease payments and right of use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets. The group
have established three classes of assets, Mobile Cell Sites, Vehicles and Property.

(i) **Right of use assets**
The group recognises right of use assets at the commencement date of the lease (the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right
of use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease
liabilities. The cost of right of use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments
made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received and costs to dismantle/retire the asset at a future date. Right
of use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets, recognising
a full month’s depreciation in the month of contract inception and none in the month of contract termination.

If ownership of the leased asset transfers to the group at the end of the lease term or the cost reflects the exercise of a purchase option,
depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of the asset. The right of use assets are also subject to impairment (refer to 3.14).
The group’s right of use assets are included in Note 17.

(ii) **Lease liabilities**
At the commencement date of the lease, the group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made
over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives
receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees.
The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the group and payments of
penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the group exercising the option to terminate. The group separates the lease
component from non-lease components of the contract in all class of assets.

Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses (unless they are incurred to produce inventories)
in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.

In calculating the present value of lease payments, the group uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date for classes
of assets, Mobile Cell sites and Property because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. Incremental borrowing
rates are calculated using a portfolio approach, where the group treats assets under a common lease contract with the same contract terms
collectively. The group uses the implicit rate determinable in the lease for the Vehicles class of asset. After the commencement date, the
amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying
amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the lease payments (changes to
future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine such lease payments) or a change in the assessment of an
option to purchase the underlying asset. The group’s lease liabilities are included in Note 17.

(iii) **Short-term leases and leases of low value assets**
The group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases (those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or
less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). For leases that are out of contract but expected to continue past
a 12 month period, the group uses the expected commercial lease extension as the lease term or if not determinable, a period of no longer
than 5 years, reviewed periodically. The group applies the lease of low value assets recognition exemption to leases that are considered to
be low value. Lease payments on leases of low value assets are recognised as expense in the period they relate to.

_Where the group is lessor_
Leases in which the group does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset are classified as
operating leases. Rental income arising is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and is included in revenue in the
income statement due to its operating nature. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the
carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised over the lease term on the same basis as rental income. Contingent rents are recognised
as revenue in the period in which they are earned.

**3.** **Accounting policies – continued**

**3.16.** **Inventories**
Inventories comprise mainly consumable items and goods held for resale. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable
value. Cost is calculated on a weighted average basis and includes invoice price, import duties and transportation costs. Where necessary,
write-downs in the carrying value of inventories are made for damaged, deteriorated, obsolete and unusable items, on the basis of a review
of individual items included in inventory. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the
estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

**3.17.** **Trade and other receivables**
Trade and other receivables are recognised at fair value, which is normally the original invoiced amount or amount advanced, less any
provision for expected credit losses. The group has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience,
adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced
through the use of the provision for expected credit losses, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement in “operating
costs”. When a trade receivable or other receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the provision for expected credit losses.

Trade receivables are reviewed regularly to assess the adequacy of the provision for expected credit losses in accordance with IFRS 9. The
simplified approach to providing for expected credit losses has been applied to trade receivables, which requires the use of a lifetime
expected loss provision. The credit loss rates used are based on actual collection statistics and applied to each aged debt bracket to ascertain
the provision for expected credit losses. The regular reviews of trade receivables will reduce any differences between loss estimates and
actual loss experience.

**3.18.** **Cash and cash equivalents**
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, and other short-term highly liquid investments with
original maturity of less than three months.

**3.19.** **Indefeasible rights of use (“IRU”)**
The group accounts for IRU contracts in the following manner:

(i) A contract arrangement that is for the capacity portion of an asset that is not physically distinct and does not represent substantially all
of the capacity of the asset and thereby does not provide the customer with the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits
from use of the asset is accounted for as a service and does not contain a lease pursuant to IFRS 16. These contracts arrangements have a
single performance obligation of providing capacity and revenue is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the relevant
contracts.

(ii) In the case of IRU arrangement containing a performance obligation to build fibre on behalf of the customer, comprising of a physically
distinct asset for which the customer has control, revenue is recognised at each stage of the completed build.

**3.20.** **Employee benefits**

(i) _Pension obligations_
Group companies operate various pension schemes. The schemes are generally funded through payments determined by periodic actuarial
calculations to independent trustee-administered funds. The group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.

A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the group pays fixed contributions into a separate fund. Under defined
contribution plans, the group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets
to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. The contributions are recognised as employee
benefit expense when they are due.

Typically, defined benefit plans define an amount of future pension benefit that employees have earned in return for their services to date.
The pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement is usually dependent on factors such as age, years of service and
compensation. The amount recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the group’s
defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date, less the fair value of plan assets. Plan assets are valued at their market value at the
balance sheet date using bid values. The defined benefit obligation, and the related current service cost, and, where applicable, past service
cost, are calculated by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually
unless there has been a material change in the obligations, where it is then recalculated during the year. The present value of the defined
benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using an appropriate discount rate based on current
market yields at the balance sheet date of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in euros, and reflect the duration of the related
pension liability.

The amounts of current service cost and net interest cost recognised in the income statement are computed based on actuarial assumptions
at the start of the financial year. Costs of administering the defined benefit plans, other than investment management costs, are recognised
within operating expenses in the income statement as the administrative services are received. Past service costs and negative past service
costs are recognised immediately in the group income statement.

Actuarial gains and losses, arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions, are charged or credited directly to
reserves through the statement of other comprehensive income.

Settlements and curtailments trigger immediate recognition of the consequent change in obligations and related assets or liabilities in the
group income statement. Before the effect of a curtailment or settlement is determined, the defined benefit obligation is re-measured using
current actuarial assumptions.

Under the Defined Benefit Trust Deed, the group is entitled to the surplus assets in the main superannuation fund in the event of a windup of the defined benefit scheme.

The deferred tax impact of pension plan surpluses and deficits is disclosed separately within the deferred tax assets or
liabilities, as appropriate.

(ii) _Other bonus plans_
The group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses where contractually obliged, or where there is past practice that has created a
constructive obligation. The entitlement to bonuses under performance bonus plans is usually conditional on achieving a number of
performance related targets. These bonus amounts are reflected in the financial statements when targets are determined or met and bonus
amounts are paid.

(iii) _Termination benefits_
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee
accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The group recognises termination benefits at the earlier of the following: (a)
when the group can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits; or (b) when the entity recognises costs for a restructuring that is within
the scope of IAS 37 and involves the payment of termination benefits. Termination benefits comprise the estimated benefits payable to
staff availing of voluntary leaving schemes and the associated pension impact.

**3.** **Accounting policies – continued**

**3.21.** **Provisions**
A provision is recognised when, and only when (a) the group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, (b)
it is probable (i.e. more likely than not) that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation,
and (c) a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering
the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in
the same class of obligations may be small.

Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due
to passage of time is recognised as an interest expense.

A constructive obligation for restructuring cost exists where plans are sufficiently detailed and well advanced, and where appropriate
communication to those affected has been undertaken on or before the balance sheet date.

If the group has a contract that is onerous, the present obligation under the contract is recognised and measured as a provision. However,
before a separate provision for an onerous contract is established, the group recognises any impairment loss that has occurred on assets
dedicated to that contract. An onerous contract is a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting its obligations under the contract
exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under the contract. The unavoidable costs under a contract reflect the least net cost
of exiting from the contract, which is the lower of the cost of fulfilling the contract and any compensation or penalties arising from failure
to fulfil the contract.

**3.22.** **Financial guarantee contracts**
Liabilities are initially measured at fair value in respect of financial guarantees issued by the group for the benefit of third parties, and
subsequently at the higher of the amount determined in accordance with IAS 37, “Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets”
and the amount initially recognised less cumulative amortisation, where appropriate.

**3.23.** **Contingent liabilities and contingent assets**
A contingent liability, including contingent liabilities in respect of financial guarantee contracts, is a possible obligation that arises from
past events and the existence of which will only be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events
not wholly within the control of the group, or a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised because: (a) it is not
probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, or (b) the amount of the
obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. A contingent liability is not recognised but is disclosed in the notes to the financial
statements.

A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or
non-occurrence of one or more uncertain events not wholly within the control of the group. Contingent assets are not recognised but are
disclosed in the notes to the financial statements when an inflow of economic benefits is probable. When inflow is virtually certain an asset
is recognised.

**3.24.** **Share capital**
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction,
net of tax, from the proceeds.

**3.25.** **Dividend distribution**
Final dividend distributions to equity shareholders are recognised as a distribution in the group’s financial statements in the period in which
the dividends are approved by the equity shareholders. Interim dividend distributions to equity shareholders are recognised as a distribution
in the group’s financial statements in the period in which the dividends are declared.

**3.26.** **Investments**
Investments in subsidiaries included in the company balance sheet are shown at cost less provision for impairment. Investments in
subsidiaries are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the subsidiary’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the subsidiary’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Investments that have suffered
impairment losses are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.

**3.27.** **Dividends**
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.

**4.** **Financial risk management**

**Financial risk factors**
The group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: liquidity risk, market risk (including cash flow, interest rate risk, currency
risk and price risk) and credit risk. The group’s overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets, and
seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the group. The group uses different methods to measure different
types of risk to which it is exposed. These methods include sensitivity analysis in the case of interest rate risks, and ageing analysis for
credit risk. Responsibility for managing these risks rests with the Board.

During the year ended 31 December 2023, the group drew down €45 million of its Facility C borrowings, which are subject to a Senior
Facilities Agreement, with a maturity date of 30 June 2029.

Also, during the year, the group prepaid €104 million of the principal amount of the Facility B borrowings with a maturity date of 15 May
2026. The prepayment of Facility B borrowings was accounted for as an extinguishment of debt and resulted in an accounting gain of €2
million in the income statement within ‘finance income’.

The group also redeemed €38 million of the 3.5% Senior Secured Notes due 2026 and €58 million of the 1.75% Senior Secured Notes due
2024 in the year ended 31 December 2023. In total the group repurchased €96 million of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes
for cash of €93 million resulting in a gain of €3 million and the discount on redemption of Senior Secured Notes was included in the income
statement within ‘finance income’.

Dividend distributions totalling €200 million were paid to the equity shareholder, Wexford Limited, and dividend distributions totalling
€37 million were paid to the NCI (non-controlling interests) shareholders during the year ended 31 December 2023.

There have been no other significant changes in the types of financial risks or the group’s risk management program (including methods
used to measure the risks) since 31 December 2022.

**4.1. Liquidity risk**
The objective of liquidity management is to ensure the availability of sufficient funds to meet the group’s requirements and to repay
maturing debt and other liabilities as they fall due.

As set out in Note 2, having reviewed the group’s business plans and cash flow forecasts, the Directors consider that the group will be able
to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the ordinary course of business for the foreseeable future. Management of the group’s
liquidity risk is fundamental to its operations. The nature of the group’s business, its working capital management activities and investment
in network assets has often resulted in minimal current assets or net current liabilities.

The eircom Holdings (Ireland) Limited group has net current liabilities of €388 million at 31 December 2023. The current liabilities at that
date include deferred revenue of €102 million. There is no cash outflow requirement associated with deferred revenue.

**4.2.** **Capital risk management**
The group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the group’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can provide
returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders over the long term. The capital structure of the group consists of the borrowings
as set out above, and equity comprising issued capital, reserves and accumulated losses as set out in the ‘Group statement of changes in
equity’. No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes for the years ended 31 December 2023 and 2022.

**4.3.** **Credit risk**
Credit risk refers to the loss that the group would incur if a debtor or other counter-party fails to perform under its contractual obligations.
Credit risks are mainly related to counter-party risks associated with cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, trade receivables, other
debtors, amounts owed by related companies and derivative contracts.

The group’s trade receivables are generated by a large number of customers, both private individuals and companies in various industries,
mainly in Ireland. Exposure to credit loss and subscriber fraud is actively monitored on a regular basis, including some processing of
current credit information on subscribers from third-party sources (subject to availability) and, where appropriate, a provision for expected
credit losses is made.

The credit risk and net exposure on key accounts, particularly other authorised operators and international carriers, is monitored separately
through continual risk assessments of customers with material balances. In terms of the overall exposure from credit risk, the receivables
from these counter-parties are not so extensive as to be considered significant concentrations of credit risk.

With respect to the trade receivables that are neither impaired nor past due, there are no indications as of the reporting date that the debtors
will not meet their payment obligations.

The group held collateral on trade receivables in the form of cash deposits of €15 million (31 December 2022: €15 million) as security.

The group is exposed to credit risk relating to its cash and cash equivalents. The group treasury policy is designed to limit exposure with
any one institution and to invest its excess cash in low risk investment accounts with authorised banking counter-parties and with
institutions whose long-term Standard & Poor’s (S&P) credit rating is “BBB+” or above (or Moody’s equivalent rating of “Baa1”) or is an

The principal aim of managing the interest rate risk is to limit the adverse impact on cash flows and shareholder value of movements in
interest rates.

Cash and cash equivalents and borrowings at variable rates expose the group to cash flow interest rate risk. Cash and cash equivalents and
borrowings at a fixed rate expose the group to fair value interest rate risk.

On 30 June 2022, the group entered into Facility B borrowings of €765 million and in accordance with the terms of the Senior Facilities
Agreement, the group was required to hedge its exposure to interest rate risk on not less than 70 per cent of its €765 million debt. During
the period ended 31 December 2022, the group entered into four interest rate swaps with a notional principal amount of €536 million with
a maturity date of 31 May 2026. These swaps have the effect of fixing the floating rate part of the interest rate payable under €536 million
of the group’s €765 million Facility B debt to 1.463% for €383 million (effective date 31 August 2022) and 2.563% for €153 million
(effective date 30 November 2022) for the duration of the swaps.

As at reporting date, the group had the following cash and cash equivalents (Note 25) and floating-rate borrowings (Note 28):

**31 December 2022** **31 December 2023**

**Weighted** **Balance** **Weighted** **Balance**

**average** **average**

**Interest rate** **Interest rate**

**%** **€m** **%** **€m**


Cash and cash equivalents 1.7% 507 **4.0%** **182**

Bank borrowings (Facility B) 4.8% (1,050) **7.1%** **(946)**

Bank borrowings (FNI Facility B) 4.2% (765) **6.2%** **(765)**

Bank borrowings (FNI Facility C) - - **6.2%** **(45)**

Interest rate swaps (Notional principal amount) 536 **536**

**Net exposure to interest rate risk** (772) **(1,038)**

**Interest rate sensitivity analysis**
Based on the financial instruments held at the balance sheet date, if interest rates are 100 basis points (“bps”) higher/lower and all other
variables are held constant, the group’s profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2023 will increase or decrease by the amounts set
out in the table below:

**Group – after tax** **Increase by** **Decrease by**

**100 bps** **100 bps** **100 bps** **100 bps**

**31 Dec 2022** **31 Dec 2023** **31 Dec 2022** **31 Dec 2023**

**€’m** **€’m** **€’m** **€’m**


Profit for the year - (lower)/higher


(7)


**(9)**


**9**


7


A sensitivity of 100 bps (31 December 2022: 100 bps) has been selected as this is considered reasonable given the current level of both
short-term and long-term interest rates.

**Currency risk**
The group conducts its business primarily in Ireland and, therefore, operating and investing cash flows are substantially denominated in
euro. A limited level of foreign exchange risk arises in relation to a foreign subsidiary, capital expenditure denominated in foreign
currencies and foreign exchange settlements with international third party telecommunications carriers.

Given the limited level of risk the group does not hedge its foreign exchange risk arising on transactions and capital expenditure
denominated in foreign currencies.

**Price risk**
The group is exposed to price risk on the assets held by the group’s defined benefit pension scheme (see Note 37).

**4.** **Financial risk management – continued**

**4.5.** **Fair value estimation**
The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on the quoted market prices at the balance sheet date. IFRS 13
requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level based on the following fair value measurement hierarchy:

**Level 1 comprises financial assets and liabilities valued using quoted market prices in active markets at the balance sheet date. An active**
market is one in which transactions occur with sufficient volume and frequency to provide pricing information on an arm’s length basis on
an on-going basis.

**Level 2 comprises financial assets and liabilities valued using techniques based significantly on observable market data. These valuation**
techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates.

**Level 3 comprises financial assets and liabilities valued using techniques where the impact of the non-observable market data is significant**
in determining the fair value of the instrument.

The fair value of borrowings is disclosed in Notes 28.

**4.6.** **Hedging instruments**
During the period ended 31 December 2022, the group entered into a number of swaps to cover interest rate exposure on the Facility B
borrowings of €765 million. These instruments have been designated as cash flow hedges and movements in the effective portion of the
fair value of the hedges have been taken through the cash flow hedge reserve.

**Derivatives designated and eligible for hedge accounting**
The details of the effective interest rate and maturity of these designated and effective hedging instruments are:

**Maturity date – principal value**

 - at 31 December 2022 536 24 1.777% - - - 536 - 
The effective interest rates in the table above are based on the effective interest rates in the derivative financial instruments designated for
cash flow hedging. This does not equate to the effective interest rate on the underlying debt as it excludes the margin over EURIBOR,
payable in respect of the €765 million Facility B borrowings. The margin on the €765 million facility is 2.25% over EURIBOR for the first
three years, 2.5% for year four and five, 2.75% for year six and 3% for year seven.

Further information on the group's use of interest rate swaps is included in Note 26.

**5.** **Critical Accounting Judgements and Estimates**

The group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal
the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities are noted below. Further details are included in the Notes to the financial statements.

The areas involving significant estimates or judgements are:

- Accounting treatment for exit from joint venture (Note 9)

- Estimation of current tax payable and recognition of deferred tax (Note 13)

- Making appropriate assumptions on non-financial asset impairment reviews (Note 14 and Note 17)

- Establishing lives for amortisation purposes of intangible assets (Note 15)

- Establishing lives for depreciation purposes of property, plant and equipment (Note 16)

- Estimating the incremental borrowing rate on leases (Note 17)

- Providing for expected credit losses (Note 22 and Note 23)

- Allocation of revenue between performance obligations (Note 23)

- Estimation of cash outflows on onerous lease contracts (Note 30 (a))

- Making appropriate assumptions in calculating asset retirement obligations (Note 30 (c))

- Providing for litigation, contingencies and other constructive obligations (Note 30 (e))

- Making appropriate long-term assumptions in calculating pension liabilities, surpluses and costs (Note 37)

Judgements and estimates are continually evaluated. They are based on historical experiences and other factors, including expectations of
future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

**6.** **Segment information**

IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the group which are regularly
reviewed by the ‘Chief Operating Decision Maker’ in order to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.

The group’s operating segments are reported based on financial information provided to the Senior Management Team (“SMT”), which is
the key management team and represents the ‘Chief Operating Decision Maker’. The SMT is chaired by the Group Chief Executive and
the other members are the Group Chief Financial Officer, Chief Technology Officer, Chief Information Officer, Business Directors,
Customer Operations Director, HR Director, Director of Regulatory & Public Policy and General Counsel.

The SMT considers the business from a fixed line and mobile perspective and assesses the performance of the operating segments based
on a measure of adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is before non-cash lease contracts, non-cash pension charge and exceptional items.
This measurement basis excludes the effects of significant or non-recurring expenditure from the operating segments such as restructuring
costs, curtailment gains and losses in respect of pensions, charges in respect of certain management performance related bonuses,
impairment of assets (including goodwill), gains/losses on exit from subsidiary undertaking/joint venture and onerous contracts. The noncash lease contracts credit included in the income statement during the period is in respect of the unfavourable lease fair value adjustment
which arose on acquisition of eircom Limited. The non-cash pension charge is determined based on the difference between the charge
determined under IAS 19 and employer contributions payable in respect of the financial year. Interest costs on borrowings are not allocated
to segments, as this type of activity is driven by the central treasury function, which manages the borrowings position of the group.

Sales between segments for telecommunication services are carried out on an arm’s length basis. Other recharges in respect of nontelecommunication services are based on actual cost of employee remuneration or other external costs incurred. The revenue from external
parties reported to the SMT is measured in a manner consistent with that in the group income statement.

The segment results for the year ended 31 December 2023 are as follows:

ended 31 December 2023 which resulted in a gain on extinguishment of debt of €2 million (31 December 2022: €3 million). This is the
difference between the fair value of the consideration paid to extinguish the liability and the carrying value of the liability at that date.

The weighted average applicable tax rate was 12.5% (31 December 2022: 12.5%).

The group has applied the mandatory exception to recognising and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities arising
from Pillar Two income taxes. Furthermore, the group is in the process of assessing its exposure to Pillar Two legislation for when it comes
into effect on 1 January 2024. The assessment indicates that the group's effective tax rate may be marginally below 15%. However, although
the average effective rate may be below 15%, due to the impact of specific adjustments in the Pillar 2 legislation it is envisaged that the
group may not be exposed to paying additional Pillar Two income taxes.

**(c)** **Significant estimates and judgements**

_Current tax_
The actual tax the group pays is determined according to complex tax laws and regulations. Where the effect of these laws and regulations
are unclear, the group uses estimates in determining the liability for the tax to be paid. The group believes the estimates, assumptions and
judgements are reasonable but the estimates can involve complex issues which may take a number of years to resolve. The final
determination of tax liabilities could be different from the estimates reflected in the financial statements and may result in the recognition
of an additional tax expense or tax credit in the income statement in future periods. The value of the group’s current tax liability is disclosed
on the balance sheet.

_Deferred tax_
Deferred tax assets and liabilities require management judgement in determining the amounts to be recognised. In particular, judgement is
used when assessing the extent to which deferred tax assets should be recognised with consideration given to the timing and level of future
taxable income. The carrying value of the group’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are disclosed in Notes 19 and 29, respectively.

Goodwill is not subject to amortisation. Instead, goodwill is tested for impairment annually as part of the cash generating unit (“CGU”) to
which it relates, and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

The majority of the group’s goodwill carried forward from prior years relates to the acquisition of eircom Limited in June 2012, pursuant
to a Scheme of Arrangement of creditors approved by the High Court. The company acquired 100% of the share capital of eircom Limited
for consideration of €1. Goodwill of €836 million was recognised as the difference between the purchase consideration and the fair value
of the individual assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition, 11 June 2012. The goodwill arose in part because eircom Limited was
acquired for a nominal amount pursuant to the Scheme of Arrangement and because the pension obligation and the deferred tax balances
were recognised in accordance with the measurement requirements of IAS 19 and IAS 12 respectively and not at fair value. No goodwill
was allocated to the Mobile CGU. The group identified an impairment of €542 million in the year ended 30 June 2012 relating to the Fixed
Line CGU.

In the year ended 30 June 2013, eircom Limited sold its 100% shareholding in eircom Phonewatch Limited and recognised disposal of
goodwill of €102 million as a result of the transaction.

On 1 March 2021, the group acquired 100% of the share capital of Evros Technology Group, a leading IT services provider, based in
Ireland. Goodwill of €43 million was recognised on the acquisition of Evros Technology Group and allocated to the group’s Fixed Line
CGU.

The CGU summary of the goodwill allocation is as follows:

**Impairment test of Fixed Line CGU as at 31 December 2023**
An impairment test of the Fixed Line CGU was performed as at 31 December 2023 in accordance with IAS 36, Impairment of Assets. The
impairment test has been undertaken at the year end date. Tangible and intangible assets are an integrated part of the CGU carrying values
and are tested together with the goodwill. No impairment was identified.

An impairment test of the Fixed Line CGU is required annually as it contains goodwill. An impairment test of the Mobile CGU is not
required as at 31 December 2023 as the group held no Mobile intangible assets not yet available for use for which the recoverable amount
could not be estimated on an individual asset basis. The Directors concluded that there was no indicator of impairment and consequently
no test of impairment was required to be performed.

##### Notes to the Financial Statements
_For the Year Ended 31 December 2023_

**14. Goodwill - continued**

_Impairment testing methodology_
The recoverable amount of the CGU is determined on the basis of the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use, using the
discounted cash flow (DCF) method. Cash flows for the years beyond the approved business plans are extrapolated using the estimated
long-term growth rates stated below. The cash flows are discounted using the discount rates stated below.

The cash flows and assumptions used as of 31 December 2023 for the impairment test are consistent with the assumptions that would be
made by a market participant acquiring the CGU.

_Key assumptions_
The key assumptions are based on past experience, adjusted for expected changes in future conditions. Key assumptions involved in the
calculation of value in use include management’s estimates of future operating cash-flows, capital expenditure requirements, tax
considerations, discount rates and long-term growth rates. The key assumptions in relation to long-term growth rates and discount rates
were benchmarked against external information on comparable companies in similar markets.

The group considers the business plan and long-term projections to be reasonable in view of the anticipated long-term performance of the
Irish economy and consistent with the assumptions that would be used by a market participant. Adjustments are made to the business plan
cash flows to take account of possible variations in the amount or timing of cash flows, which can be affected by factors such as increased
competitor activity, the roll-out of new technologies and the timing of the introduction of new services, pricing trends, termination rates,
customer acquisition costs, margin levels and restructuring programmes, such that the estimated cash flows reflect the range of possible
outcomes for each CGU’s future trading performance.

_Cash flow projections_
At 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022, these calculations used post-tax cash flow projections based on business plans approved by
management, as adjusted for market participant assumptions, covering a period up to 31 December 2028.

The other key assumptions used for impairment for the Fixed Line and Mobile CGUs are as follows:

**Fixed Line** **Mobile** **Fixed Line** **Mobile**

**31 Dec 2022** **31 Dec 2022** **31 Dec 2023** **31 Dec 2023**

Long-term growth rates -0.75% N/A **-0.75%** **N/A**

Discount rates (Pre-tax) 5.29% N/A **4.93%** **N/A**

Discount rates (Post-tax) 4.63% N/A **4.31%** **N/A**

Budgeted EBITDA[1] 0.91% N/A **0.98%** **N/A**

Budgeted capital expenditure[2] 25% N/A **13%-24%** **N/A**

**Notes:**

1 Budgeted EBITDA is expressed as the compound annual growth rates over the periods covered by the business plans for all cash
generating units of the plans used for impairment testing.

2 Budgeted capital expenditure is expressed as the range of capital expenditure as a percentage of revenue (for all periods covered by the

business plans plus the terminal value).

_Long Term Growth Rates_
The long-term growth rates are determined based on the long-term historical growth rates of the sectors in which the CGUs operate, and
reflect an assessment of the long-term growth prospects of the sectors. The growth rates have been benchmarked against external data for
the relevant markets. None of the growth rates applied exceed the long-term historical average growth rates for those markets or sectors.

_Discount Rates_
The discount rates used reflect specific risks relating to the CGUs. The assumptions used have been benchmarked to externally available
data. The methodology is based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). At 31 December 2023, the yield on fifteen-year Irish
government bonds provided the basis for the risk free rate, which was then adjusted to take account of market risks specific to the CGUs.
The group has used Irish government bond yields as the basis for the risk-free rate in keeping with its observations of practices applied by
external market analysts in determining appropriate weighted average costs of capital for Irish companies. In estimating the discount rate
under CAPM, in addition to the risk-free rate, other inputs required are the equity market risk premium (that is the excess return required
over and above a risk free rate by an investor who is investing in the market as a whole) and the risk adjustment factor known as beta is
applied to reflect the risk of the specific CGU operations relative to the market as a whole. In determining the risk adjusted discount rate,
management has applied an adjustment for the risk of the group’s CGUs determined using an average of the observed betas of comparable
companies.

**Significant estimates and judgements**

_Making appropriate assumptions on non-financial asset impairment reviews_
The group undertakes a review for impairment of goodwill, intangible assets not yet available for use annually and for other non-financial
assets if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

Factors which the group consider could trigger an impairment include, but are not limited to the following: (1) significant negative industry
or economic trends, (2) current, historical or projected losses that demonstrate continuing losses, (3) results of fair market valuations
performed or (4) changes in key assumptions underpinning the fair value less cost to sell and value in use calculations. These impairment
charges under IFRS are based upon the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its recoverable amount, which is the higher of the
fair value less cost to sell and its value in use, based on discounted future cash flows. When an asset is not recoverable in full, impairment
is measured as the excess of carrying value over the recoverable amount of the long-life asset. Management incorporates estimates when
evaluating the carrying amount, the recoverable amount, the value in use and the fair value less cost to sell. Changes in these estimates
directly affect management’s assessment of whether an impairment charge is required and the amount of the impairment charge recorded.

The discount rate used in impairment testing is derived from a weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) which is impacted by interest
rates and market risk premiums, estimated for companies in the telecommunications sector. There is a risk that the WACC could increase
significantly in future periods, depending on market volatility. There is also a risk of deterioration in the budgeted future cash flows as a
result of the current economic environment.

Any significant deterioration in the budgeted future cash flows or changes in WACC or estimates in respect of terminal growth rates could
result in a further impairment of our goodwill and/or non-financial assets, which could have a further negative effect on operating profits
and assets. Future cash flows would not be impacted by any impairment provision.

**Significant estimates and judgements**
_Establishing lives for amortisation purposes of intangible assets_
The group has significant levels of intangible assets. The amortisation charge is dependent on the estimated lives allocated to each type of
intangible asset. The Directors regularly review these asset lives and change them as necessary to reflect current thinking on remaining
lives and the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset. Changes in asset lives can have a
significant impact on amortisation charges for the period.

The group’s policy is to review the remaining economic lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment on an ongoing basis
and to adjust the depreciation charge to reflect the remaining estimated life and residual value. The review for the year ended 31 December
2023 and for the year ended 31 December 2022 resulted in no material adjustments to asset lives.

Assets in the course of construction not yet available for use included in property, plant and equipment are €223 million (31 December

**Significant estimates and judgements**
_Establishing lives for depreciation purposes of property, plant and equipment_
Long-life assets, consisting primarily of property, plant and equipment, comprise a significant portion of the total assets. The annual
depreciation charge depends primarily on the estimated lives of each type of asset and, in certain circumstances, estimates of fair values
and residual values. The Directors regularly review these asset lives and change them as necessary to reflect current thinking on remaining
lives in light of technological change, prospective economic utilisation, physical condition of the assets concerned and other factors that
may impact on the remaining useful lives of assets. Changes in asset lives can have a significant impact on depreciation charges for the
period. It is not practical to quantify the impact of changes in asset lives on an overall basis as asset lives are individually determined and
there are a significant number of asset lives in use. The impact of any change would vary significantly depending on the individual changes
in assets and the classes of assets impacted. For additional information see details of the useful lives set out in Note 3.13.

group also had non-cash additions to right of use assets and lease liabilities of €41 million in the year ended 31 December 2023 (31
December 2022: €52 million).

**Significant estimates and judgements**
_Estimating incremental borrowing rate on leases_
The group cannot readily determine the interest rate implicit in the lease, therefore, it uses its incremental borrowing rate (IBR) to measure
lease liabilities. The IBR is the rate of interest that the group would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, and with a similar security,
the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment. The IBR therefore
reflects what the group ‘would have to pay’, which requires estimation when no observable rates are available or when they need to be
adjusted to reflect the terms and conditions of the lease. The group estimates the IBR using observable inputs (such as market interest rates)
when available.

_Estimating impairment for non-financial assets_
The group performs impairment indicator analysis at each reporting period. If any indicators are present, the group estimates the recoverable
amount of the asset (or the CGU of which the asset is a part). The entity has to recognise an impairment loss if the recoverable amount of
the CGU is less than the carrying amount of the CGU. After an impairment loss is recognised, the adjusted carrying amount of the nonfinancial asset would be its new basis for depreciation.

The fair values of trade and other receivables approximate to their carrying amounts.

The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of receivable mentioned above.

The amount of the provision for expected credit losses of trade receivables was €33 million as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022:
€35 million). Total additional provisions of €11 million (31 December 2022: €8 million) relate to individual expected credit losses of €Nil
(31 December 2022: €Nil) and collective expected credit losses of €11 million (31 December 2022: €8 million).

**Significant estimates and judgements**
_Providing for expected credit losses_
The group uses a provision matrix to calculate ECLs for its trade receivables. The provision rates are based on days past due for groupings
of various customer segments that have similar loss patterns. The provision matrix is initially based on the group's historical observed
default rates. The group annually undertakes the review of the reasonableness of the historical observed default rates and recalibrates the
matrix to adjust the historical credit loss experience with forward-looking information, as deemed necessary. On a quarterly basis, the rates
are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed. The assessment of the correlation between historical observed
default rates, forward-looking information, and ECLs is a significant estimate. The amount of ECL is sensitive to changes in circumstances
and forecast economic conditions. The group's historical credit loss experience and forecast of economic conditions may also not be
representative of customer's actual default in the future.

**Allowance for expected credit losses**
The following table shows the movement in the allowance for expected credit losses of trade receivables:

**23.** **Contract assets**
As of 31 December 2023, the group has contract assets of €28 million (31 December 2022: €25 million). The following table shows the

The contract assets included in the balance sheet of €28 million (31 December 2022: €25 million) has been recognised net of an expected
credit loss of €3 million (31 December 2022: €3 million).

**Significant estimates and judgements**
_Allocation of revenue between performance obligations_
The standalone price determined for the performance obligations within contracts materially impact the allocation of revenue between
performance obligations. The determination of the standalone price requires judgement and impacts the allocation of the transaction price
when revenue is recorded in cases where obligations are provided to customers at different times – for example, the allocation of revenue
between handsets, which are usually delivered up-front, and services which are typically delivered over the contract period.

_Impairment of contract assets_
The group uses a simplified approach in determining impairment loss for its contract assets. The group considers similarities in the
underlying credit risk characteristics and behaviour in determining the appropriate groupings to which impairment rates will be applied.
The group uses the average historical churn rates and adjusts these rates for relevant forward-looking information. At each reporting date,
the churn rates are reviewed and updated as necessary to reflect current customer behaviour. There have been no significant changes in the
estimation techniques used in determining impairment of contract assets in 2023 and 2022.

**24.** **Restricted cash**

**_31 December 2023_**
The restricted cash of €1 million is in relation to cash lodged for security in respect of ancillary facilities. The interest earned on these
deposits, after deduction of any taxation payable, is due to the group.

**_31 December 2022_**
The restricted cash of €56 million is in relation to cash lodged in respect of a spectrum licence application of €55 million and €1 million
for security in respect of ancillary facilities. The interest earned on these deposits, after deduction of any taxation payable, is due to the
group.

The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is €1 million (31 December 2022: €56 million).

_Fair value hierarchy_
The table below shows for the group’s financial assets that are recognised and subsequently measured at fair value their classification
within a three-level fair value hierarchy.

**Level 1 comprises financial assets and liabilities valued using quoted market prices in active markets at the balance sheet date. An active**
market is one in which transactions occur with sufficient volume and frequency to provide pricing information on an arm’s length basis on
an on-going basis.

**Level 2 comprises financial assets and liabilities valued using techniques based significantly on observable market data. These valuation**
techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates.

**Level 3 comprises financial assets and liabilities valued using techniques where the impact of the non-observable market data is significant**
in determining the fair value of the instrument.

**(a)** **Onerous contracts**
The group has onerous contracts associated with vacant offices and leasehold properties, mainly arising from the liability recognised on
the acquisition of eircom Limited in June 2012 and the more recent operational restructurings. The group also has onerous contracts
associated with ongoing data centre operations.

The group transferred the onerous lease liabilities for rental and exit costs on transition to IFRS 16 to ‘Right of Use Assets’ as an impairment
of those assets. The remaining onerous contracts provision of €32 million (31 December 2022: €29 million) is mainly for rates, facilities
and services charges in relation to the leasehold properties.

At 31 December 2023, the liabilities are expected to be discharged over a period of one to twelve years, and these anticipated cash flows
are discounted using a risk free rate of return of between 2.2% and 2.4%.

**Significant estimates and judgements**
The group has estimated the future cash outflows arising from these onerous contracts. The estimation of outflows reflect current economic
conditions and estimates are used in determining the level of provisions required in respect of these leasehold properties.

**30.** **Provisions for other liabilities and charges - continued**

**(b)** **Temporary income stream (“TIS”) annuity scheme**
The eircom Limited group established an annuity scheme whereby employees participating in a voluntary termination scheme could accept
payment in one lump sum or as an annuity to be paid out over a period of ten years. The group estimates the annuity liability as the present
value of the fixed payment stream due to employees. At 31 December 2023, the remaining TIS annuity scheme provision is expected to be
substantially utilised over a period of six years.

**(c)** **Asset Retirement Obligations**
The group has provisions for costs arising from certain obligations in relation to the retirement and decommissioning of assets, mainly
certain poles, batteries, international cable and dismantling and restoration of mobile antenna sites. It is expected that most of these costs
will be paid during the period 2024 to 2038, and these anticipated cash flows are discounted using a risk free rate of return of between 2%
and 4%.

**Significant estimates and judgements**
Significant judgement is required in determining the amount and timing of cash flows associated with the asset retirement obligations as
some of the cash flows are anticipated up to 15 years in the future, and there has been no significant retirement or decommissioning costs
incurred to date. There are also ongoing changes in legislation which impact on the group’s assessment on the level of cost and the manner
in which certain asset retirement obligations can be met. Any adverse changes in legislation or interpretations of existing legislation could
have a significant impact on the group’s estimate of its asset retirement obligations.

**(d)** **Deferred Consideration/Completion Scheme**
On 1 March 2021, the group acquired 100% of the share capital of Evros Technology Group, a leading IT services provider, based in
Ireland. As set out in the Share Purchase Agreement, the group was required to make deferred consideration payments, subject to warranties,
to the former owners of Evros Technology Group. The remaining liability of €4 million was paid in the year ended 31 December 2023.

In addition, there was a €10 million acquisition completion scheme for certain members of staff provided by the former owners of Evros
Technology Group and the remaining liability of €2 million was paid in the year ended 31 December 2022.

**(e)** **Other**
The group is self insured in respect of certain personal injury and damage claims for the estimated cost of incidents which have occurred
up to 31 December 2023, based on a case by case review with actuarial assistance. The payments will be made as the cases are settled.
The group also has provisions for costs arising from certain compliance matters, consisting primarily of commercial matters, which are
being handled and defended in the ordinary course of business.

**Significant estimates and judgements**
In determining whether provisions are required with respect to pending or threatened litigation, management reviews the following: (1) the
period in which the underlying cause of the pending or threatened litigation or of the actual or possible claim or assessment occurred, (2)
the degree of probability of an unfavourable outcome, and (3) the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Upon
considering the above and other known relevant facts and circumstances, the group recognises any loss that is considered probable and that
can be measured reliably as of the balance sheet date. In addition, the group provides for other items of an uncertain timing or amount,
such as liabilities arising as a result of self-insurance and disputes with third parties, including regulatory and taxation authorities. These
provisions are recognised when the group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events and a reliable estimate of that
obligation can be made. Estimates and judgements are used in determining the level of provisioning required and the timing of payments.

For additional information see details of the contingent liabilities set out in Note 39.

In January 2024, subsequent to the balance sheet date, the group successfully executed €200 million loan tap to the €946 million Facility
B borrowings, with a maturity date of 15 May 2026. The additional Facility B borrowings are subject to cash-pay interest at EURIBOR

**37.** **Retirement benefit asset**
(a) The group's pension commitments are funded through separately administered Superannuation Schemes and are principally of a

defined benefit nature.

The total group pension charge is split between the schemes as follows:

**Notes** **Year ended** **Year ended**

**Defined Benefit Schemes** 13 **(22)**

**Defined Contribution Schemes** 7 5 **5**

Total 18 **(17)**

**Defined Benefit Schemes**
The group sponsors a defined benefit scheme for members in Ireland, the eircom Main Superannuation Scheme. In the year ended 30 June
2014, the group established a separate, limited scope ancillary scheme, the eircom Limited early retirement pension scheme (‘Early
Retirement Trust’). At 31 December 2023, the eircom Main Superannuation Fund accounts for in excess of 99% of the group's defined
benefit obligations measured in accordance with IAS 19 (Revised) "Employee Benefits".

The defined benefit schemes are funded and the assets of the schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds, the eircom Main
Superannuation Fund and the Early Retirement Trust.

**Regulatory Framework**
The group operates the defined benefit plans under broadly similar regulatory frameworks. Benefits under the Schemes are paid to members
from a fund administered by Trustees, who are responsible for ensuring compliance with the Pensions Act 1990 and other relevant
legislation. Plan assets are held in trusts and are governed by local regulations and practice in each country.

**eircom Main Superannuation Scheme**
The Scheme is closed to new entrants. However, benefits continue to accrue to members in active service, and benefits in deferment and
in payment are subject to discretionary increases on the part of the group.

Retirement benefits under the Main Superannuation Scheme are calculated by reference to pensionable service and pensionable salary at
normal retirement date. Principal benefits comprise of:

(i) Retirement pension, calculated at 1/80[th] of pensionable pay for each year of reckonable service, up to a maximum of 40/80ths
(that is, half pensionable pay). Pensionable pay in most cases is made up of a member's wages or salary at the last day of service
plus certain pensionable allowances

(ii) Retirement gratuity (also known as "lump-sum"), calculated at 3/80[th] of pensionable pay for each year of reckonable service, up
to a maximum of 120/80ths (that is, one and a half times pensionable pay).

(iii) Death gratuity, for in-service members, of at least one year's pensionable pay subject to a limit of one and a half times pensionable
salary calculated in the same manner as the retirement gratuity.

On an ongoing basis, the Scheme's liabilities consist of obligations to make benefit payments to current and potential future beneficiaries.

As a result of the Pensions Accord, agreed with Trade Unions in 2010, pension increases, if any, will be capped at the lowest of the
following:

- the percentage increase in actual pay awarded;

- the percentage increases in consumer prices in the year as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) published by the CSO for the
prior year to 31 December; and

- maximum annual increase of 2.5%.

**37. Retirement benefit asset - continued**

**Early Retirement Trust**
The Early Retirement Trust was established in the year ended 30 June 2014 to provide benefits to staff exiting under the Incentivised Exit
Programme who opted to avail of an enhanced early retirement option with up to five years added service. In addition to their pre-existing
membership of the eircom Main Superannuation Scheme, those individuals became members of the Early Retirement Trust, which provides
fixed pension benefits between the last day of service and age sixty. At age sixty, benefits from the Early Retirement Trust cease and the
preserved benefits under the eircom Main Superannuation Scheme become payable. The Early Retirement Trust is now closed and there
are no further liabilities for this scheme as at 31 December 2023.

**eircom Main Superannuation Scheme Actuarial Valuation and Funding**
The actual contribution rate in respect of the principal scheme is 8.5% of pensionable emoluments, for the period to the next valuation, as
advised by the group's actuaries. The last actuarial valuation of the principal scheme was carried out using the attained age method, as at
31 March 2022, by Mercer, who are actuaries to the Scheme but are neither officers nor employees of the group. The actuarial method used
involved determining an appropriate future group contribution rate designed to fund the projected liabilities of the Scheme related to service
subsequent to 1 January 1984 (see Note 37 (b)) over the remaining working lifetime of the current members.

The actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2022 was determined by reference to the following critical assumptions: (1) an assumed rate of
pensionable pay and pension inflation of 2.5% per annum and (2) an assumed rate of investment return of 1.49%. At the date of the last
actuarial valuation, the market value of the pension scheme assets was €4,756 million, and the actuarial valuation of the assets attributable
to the pension fund was sufficient to meet more than 100% of the value of the scheme's accrued liabilities making due allowance for future
increases in salaries and pensions.

The actuarial valuation report also indicated that the Scheme met the Minimum Funding Standard as at 31 March 2022, and included a
completed Actuarial Funding Certificate confirming this outcome. The actuarial report is available for inspection by the members of the
scheme at 2 Heuston South Quarter, St. John’s Road West, Dublin 8, Ireland. The actuarial report is not available for public inspection.

It is intended that the next scheduled formal valuation of the Scheme will be undertaken at 31 March 2025.

Mercer also perform all annual valuations required under IAS 19 “Employee Benefits”. These valuations are performed on the projected
unit basis.

**37. Retirement benefit asset - continued**

**Sensitivity of defined benefit obligation to key assumptions**
The table below sets out the sensitivity of defined benefit obligation to changes in key assumptions:

**Impact on actuarial liabilities**

**Change in**

**Assumption** **31 Dec 2022** **31 Dec 2023**

**€m** **€m**


Discount rate


0.25% increase


(98)


**(96)**


Rate of increase in salaries and pensions in payment 0.25% increase 103 **99**

Life expectancy 1 year increase 91 **116**

The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, a change
in one assumption could impact on other assumptions due to the relationship between assumptions.

**Risks and risk management**
Through its defined benefit pension schemes, the group is exposed to a number of areas of risk. The key areas of risk, and the ways in
which the group has sought to manage them, are set out below.

_Property investment values_
Property investments are valued on the basis of open market value by an independent valuer. The significant assumptions used in the
valuation are rental yields and occupancy rates. In light of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic uncertainty exists in the property values.
The Directors still consider the valuations to be the best estimate of the property portfolio, but there is a higher level of uncertainty compared
to previous years.

_Asset volatility_
The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; if plan assets underperform this yield,
this will create a deficit. The funds hold a certain proportion of equities, which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the longterm while providing volatility and risk in the short-term.

There is also an element of credit risk attaching to the bond portfolio and currency risk to the extent that assets are denominated in currencies
other than the euro and are not correspondingly hedged.

_Changes in bond yields_
From an accounting liability perspective, the schemes are also exposed to movements in corporate bond spreads. A decrease in corporate
bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the schemes' bond holdings.

_Inflation risk_
The majority of the plans’ benefit obligations are linked to inflation and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities, although in most
cases caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect the plans against high inflation.

_Life expectancy_
The majority of the schemes' obligations are to provide a pension for the life of the member and that of the member's widowed spouse,
which means that increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans’ liabilities.

**Significant estimates and judgements**
_Making appropriate long-term assumptions in calculating pension liabilities, surpluses and costs_
The group operates a funded defined benefit scheme, which is independent of the group’s finances, for certain employees. Valuations of
the main scheme are carried out by the scheme actuaries. The rates of contribution payable and the pension cost are determined on the
advice of the actuaries. The cost of these benefits and the present value of the pension liabilities depend on the assumptions made in respect
of such factors as the life expectancy of the members of the scheme, the salary progression of current employees, and the interest rate at
which the future pension payments are discounted. The group uses estimates for all of these factors in determining the pension costs,
surpluses or deficits arising on acquisitions and assets and liabilities reflected in the financial statements.

The group determines the appropriate discount rate at the end of each year. This is the interest rate that should be used to determine the
present value of estimated future cash outflows expected to be required to settle the pension obligations. In determining the appropriate
discount rate, the group considers the yields of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits
will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension obligation.

The group agreed certain caps in 2010 on future increases in pensionable salaries. The maximum increase in any given year is set at the
lower of pre-determined fixed annual rates, the rate of CPI or salary inflation. However, there is still a significant level of uncertainty in
relation to ultimate pensionable salaries that will apply in determining benefits payable. Differences between assumptions made and actual
experience and changes in assumptions made also impact on pension charges. The effect of changes in assumptions on the pension scheme
valuation is shown in the above sensitivity analyses.

Irish Department of Posts and Telegraphs who retired or died before the vesting Day (1 January 1984); (ii) costs in respect of the pension
entitlements, related to pre-vesting day reckonable service, of staff who transferred to eircom from the Irish Civil Service. Such benefit

€1,016 million from the Irish Minister for Finance in accordance with arrangements set out in the eircom Superannuation (Amendment)
Scheme, 1999.

In January 2021, the eircom No. 2 Superannuation Fund moved to a ‘pay as you go’ arrangement as agreed with the Minister for Finance
and contributions are paid to the Fund on a scheduled basis by the Minister in respect of benefits to be paid. The Minister retains full
liability for these payments.

Credit Facility, including the guarantee of the Senior Secured Notes. The guarantees are contractually subordinated in right of payment to
certain hedging obligations pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement. The Senior Credit Facility is secured by pledges over the shares in
eircom Holdings (Ireland) Limited, pledges over certain bank accounts, intercompany claims and related security of eircom Finco Sarl,
and fixed and floating charges over the assets of eircom Limited (Jersey), eircom Limited, Irish Telecommunications Investments DAC,

indebtedness that is not subordinated to the Notes, including the guarantee of the Senior Credit Facility. The guarantees are contractually
subordinated in right of payment to certain hedging obligations pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement.

consisting of €765 million Facility B term loan, €200 million Facility C term loan and €35 million undrawn revolving credit facility which
has the benefit of guarantees and security provided by Fibre Network Ireland Holdings Limited and FNI for all amounts borrowed under
the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement.

The Senior Facilities Agreement and derivative financial instruments issued by Fibre Network Ireland Limited do not benefit from any
security or guarantees provided by the eircom Holdings (Ireland) Limited Group.

**39.** **Contingent liabilities**
There were a number of lawsuits, claims and disputes with third parties including regulatory and taxation authorities that have arisen in the
normal course of business. While any litigation or dispute with regulatory and tax authorities has an element of uncertainty, the Directors
believe that there were no contingent liabilities which would have a material adverse effect on the group’s financial position.

**Independent Auditor’s Report to the members of eircom Holdings (Ireland) Limited**

**_Report on the audit of the financial statements_**

**Opinion**

We have audited the non-statutory financial statements of eircom Holdings (Ireland) Limited (‘the Company’) and its subsidiaries (‘the
Group’) for the period ended 31 December 2022, which comprise the Group Income Statement, Group Statement of Comprehensive
Income, Group Balance Sheet, Group Cash Flow Statement, Group Statement of Changes in Equity and notes to the financial statements,
including the summary of significant accounting policies set out in note 3. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in
their preparation is International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union.

In our opinion:

 - the Group financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the group as at 31
December 2022 and of its profit for the period then ended;

 - the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union.

**Basis for opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (Ireland) (ISAs (Ireland)). Our responsibilities under
those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We
are independent of the Group and Company in accordance with ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of financial statements
in Ireland, including the Ethical Standard issued by the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority (IAASA), and we have
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

**Conclusions relating to going concern**

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation
of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually
or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group’s or the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least
twelve months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this
report. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s or the
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

**Other information**

The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report other
than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information
and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.


-----

**Other information (continued)**

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with
the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material
inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial
statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a
material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

**Respective responsibilities**

**Responsibilities of directors for the financial statements**

As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page F-4, the directors are responsible for the preparation
of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework that give a true and fair view, and for such
internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as going
concerns, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management
either intends to liquidate the Group or the parent Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

**Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance,
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (Ireland) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the IAASA's website at:
[http://www.iaasa.ie/getmedia/b2389013-1cf6-458b-9b8f- a98202dc9c3a/Description_of_auditors_responsibilities_for_audit.pdf.](http://www.iaasa.ie/getmedia/b2389013-1cf6-458b-9b8f-)

This description forms part of our auditor's report.

**The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe our responsibilities**

This report is made solely to the Company’s directors, as a body, in accordance with our engagement letter dated 7 March 2023. Our
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s directors those matters we are required to state to them in an
auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone
other than the Company and the Company’s directors, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

#### eircom Holdings (Ireland) Limited

##### Notes to the Financial Statements
_For the Year Ended 31 December 2022_

**1.** **General information**

eircom Holdings (Ireland) Limited (‘the company’) and its subsidiaries together (“the group” or “eircom Holdings (Ireland) Limited group”
or “EHIL Group”), provide fixed line and mobile telecommunications services in Ireland.

eircom Holdings (Ireland) Limited is incorporated as a company limited by shares in Ireland, under the registered number 512352. The
address of its registered office is 2022 Bianconi Avenue, Citywest Business Campus, Dublin 24. The company was incorporated on 23
April 2012. The company holds 100% of the issued share capital of two principal subsidiaries: eircom Finco Sarl and eircom Limited.
eircom Finco Sarl, a company registered in Luxembourg, was incorporated on 24 May 2012.

On 11 June 2012, the company acquired 100% of the issued share capital of eircom Limited for €1.00 pursuant to a Scheme of Arrangement
approved by the Irish High Court. The principal trading activities of the group are undertaken by eircom Limited and its subsidiaries.
eircom Limited is the incumbent telecommunications operator in Ireland.

In the prior year, the group’s financial year was amended to 31 December 2021 and for subsequent periods, the group’s financial year ends
on 31 December, starting with 31 December 2021. The comparative amounts in the financial statements are for the eighteen-month period
ended 31 December 2021.

NJJ Holding SAS France, a company registered in France, is the ultimate holding company. Xavier Niel is the ultimate controlling party.
Wexford Limited, a company registered in Jersey, is the immediate holding company.

**2.** **Going concern**

The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis.

The Directors believe that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for the financial statements notwithstanding the
net liability position of the group, as the Directors believe that based on the group’s forecast of operational cash flows, and trading results,
the group will be in a position to meet its obligations as they fall due for the foreseeable future. The net liabilities of the group, included in
the balance sheet at 31 December 2022, include liabilities of €2,945 million in respect of borrowings which are measured at amortised cost,
and the earliest date borrowings are due is 1 November 2024 for the €280 million 1.75% Senior Secured Notes. See Note 28 Borrowings
for further information.

Having made due enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the group and the company will continue in operational
existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial
statements.

The Directors have considered the impact of COVID-19 and the current situation in Ukraine and do not consider these to be events that
would have a material impact on the financial statements.

**3.** **Accounting policies**

The significant accounting policies adopted by the group and company are set out below.

3.1. Basis of preparation
The entity and consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
and IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) interpretations as adopted by the European Union and those parts of the Companies Act
2014 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.

The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis (see Note 2). A summary of the more important accounting policies
is set out below.

The financial statements, which are presented in euro, the group rounded to the nearest million and the company in euro, have been prepared
under the historical cost convention except for the following:

- certain assets and liabilities measured at fair value upon acquisition;

- derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value; and

- pension obligations are measured at the present value of the future estimated cash flows related to benefits earned and pension assets
are valued at fair value.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results
ultimately may differ from those estimates. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions
and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed throughout the Notes.

##### Notes to the Financial Statements
_For the Year Ended 31 December 2022_

**3.** **Accounting policies – continued**

**3.1.** **Basis of preparation**

_Standards, amendments and interpretations effective for the year ended 31 December 2022_
There were no standards, amendments or interpretations effective for the year ended 31 December 2022 that had a material impact on the
consolidated financial statements of the group. The group has not early adopted any standards, amendments or interpretations that have
been issued but are not yet effective for the year ended 31 December 2022.

**3.2.** **Basis of consolidation**
The consolidated financial statements of the group comprise a consolidation of the financial statements of the company, eircom Holdings
(Ireland) Limited, and its subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures. The subsidiaries’ and joint venture’s financial period ends are all
coterminous with those of the company included in the financial statements.

(i) _Subsidiaries_
Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the group has control. The group controls an entity when the group
is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its
power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the group. Subsidiaries are
deconsolidated from the group from the date that control ceases.

(ii) _Joint arrangements_
Under IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’ investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures. The
classification depends on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor, rather than the legal structure of the joint arrangement.

The group held 56% of the equity share capital in Tetra Ireland Communications Limited (“Tetra”). However, the group’s interest in
Tetra was subject to a contractual agreement with other shareholders, which prevented the group from exercising a majority of voting
rights in key strategic, operational and financial decision-making. Accordingly, the group’s interest was accounted for as a joint venture
in accordance with IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’. On 23 March 2022, the group sold its joint venture Tetra Ireland Communications
Limited.

The group’s interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, after initially being recognised at cost in the
consolidated balance sheet. The group’s share of joint ventures post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in the income statement,
and its share of post-acquisition movements in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income. The
cumulative post-acquisition movements are recorded against the carrying amount of the investment. Dividends received or receivable
from joint ventures are recognised as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment.

When the group’s share of losses in a joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the joint venture, including any other unsecured
receivables, the group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint
venture.

Unrealised gains on transactions between the group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the group’s interest in these
entities. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Accounting policies of joint ventures have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the group.

(iii) _Acquisitions_
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for all business combinations, except for business combinations involving entities
under common control and group reorganisations. Under the purchase method of accounting, the cost of the acquisition is measured at the
aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the
group in exchange for control of the acquiree. The acquiree’s identifiable assets and liabilities are recognised at their fair values at the
acquisition date. Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the
business combination over the net fair value of the group’s share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
The interest of non-controlling interest shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at the non-controlling interest’s proportion of the
net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised, and does not include a gross-up for goodwill. The results of
subsidiaries acquired during the period are brought into the consolidated financial statements from the date control transfers to the group.

_(iv)_ _Disposals_
The results of businesses sold during the period are included in the consolidated financial statements for the period up to the date control
ceases. Gains or losses on disposal are calculated as the difference between the sale proceeds (net of expenses) and the net assets attributable
to the interest which has been sold.

**3. Accounting policies - continued**

**3.2.** **Basis of consolidation**
_(v)_ _Acquisitions involving entities under common control_
Business combinations involving entities under common control are not required to be accounted for using the purchase accounting method
under IFRS. The group instead applies the predecessor accounting method for such transactions. Under the predecessor accounting method,
which is also commonly referred to as the merger accounting method, the assets and liabilities acquired are recognised at the acquisition
date at the carrying values stated in the consolidated financial statements of the highest entity which has common control for which
consolidated IFRS financial statements are prepared. The goodwill recognised is limited to the goodwill previously recognised in the
consolidated financial statements of the highest entity which has common control. The difference between the consideration and the net
assets recognised at predecessor value is charged/credited to the merger reserve, in equity. The results of subsidiaries acquired during the
period are brought into the consolidated financial statements from the date control transfers to the group.

**3.3.** **Goodwill**
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the group’s share of the net identifiable assets, liabilities
and contingent liabilities recognised of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is
included in ‘intangible assets’.

Goodwill is not amortised. Instead, goodwill is tested for impairment annually and is earned at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Impairment losses on goodwill may not be reversed in any circumstances.

Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units for the purpose of impairment testing in accordance with IAS 36 “Impairment of Assets”.
The allocation is made to cash generating units or groups of cash generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination
in which the goodwill arose, identified according to operating segment. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the cash
generating unit’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs
to sell and value in use. These calculations require the use of estimates, including management’s expectations of future revenue, operating
costs, profit margins and capital requirements for each cash generating unit.

Gains and losses on the disposal of a cash generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated include the carrying amount of goodwill
relating to the entity sold.

**3.4.** **Other intangible assets**
Acquired computer software licences and associated costs are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the
specific software. IT development costs include only those costs directly attributable to the development phase and are only capitalised
following completion of a technical feasibility study and where the group has an intention and ability to use the asset which will contribute
future period financial benefits through revenue generation and/or cost reduction. Internal costs associated with developing computer
software programmes are also capitalised on the same basis. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives (three to four
years). Costs associated with the upgrade of computer software programmes which increase the functionality of computer software or
related assets are capitalised.

Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred.

Licence fees paid to the government, which permit telecommunications activities to be operated for defined periods, are initially recorded
at cost and amortised from the time the network is available for use to the end of the licence period.

Other intangible assets, which comprise primarily of acquired intangible assets, are capitalised at fair value and amortised using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives, from the date the intangible assets are available for use.

The following useful lives have been assigned to intangible assets:

**Years**


Computer software

Intangible assets from acquisitions:


4


Trademark (Fixed) 5

Contracts and related customer relationships (Fixed) 14

Mobile licences 15 – 18.5 [(1)]

(1) Spectrum licences are amortised over the term of the relevant licences.

Intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 “Impairment of Assets” in the same manner
as goodwill (see 3.3 above).

**3. Accounting policies - continued**

**3.5.** **Segmental reporting**
An operating segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products or services that are subject to risks and returns
that are different from those of other operating segments. Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting
provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and
assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Senior Management Team, which is the key management team
that makes strategic decisions.

**3.6.** **Revenue recognition**
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, as separate performance obligations, for the sale of goods
and services in the ordinary course of the group’s activities. Amounts disclosed as revenue are net of discounts and value added tax.
Revenue includes sales by group entities but excludes all inter-company sales.

If the group has control of goods or services when they are delivered to a customer, then the group is the principal in the sale to the
customer; otherwise the group is acting as an agent. Whether the group is considered to be the principal or an agent in the transaction
depends on analysis by management of both the legal form and substance of the agreement between the group and its business partners;
such judgements impact the amount of reported revenue and operating expenses.

The group determines the transaction price to which it expects to be entitled in return for providing the promised obligations to the customer
based on the committed contractual amounts, net of sales taxes and discounts. Where indirect channel dealers, such as retailers, acquire
customer contracts on behalf of the group and receive commission, any commissions that the dealer is compelled to use to fund discounts
or other incentives to the customer are treated as payments to the customer when determining the transaction price and consequently are
not included in contract acquisition costs. The group’s contracts are structured in such a way that there is little or no variable consideration.

Revenue is recognised when goods and services are delivered to customers; goods and services may be delivered to a customer at different
times under the same contract, hence it is necessary to allocate the amount payable by the customer between goods and services. The
group has used a relative standalone selling price basis to ascertain the goods element of the contract and this requires the identification of
performance obligations, which is discussed below.

It is necessary to estimate the standalone price when the group does not sell equivalent goods or services in similar circumstances on a
standalone basis. Where possible, the group observes the standalone prices for similar goods and services making up the total contract
price, which is the typically the case for handsets. A cost-plus reasonable margin approach is applied to arrive at the Recommended Retail
Price (‘RRP’) for prepaid handsets, hence this value is used as the standalone price of the handset for postpay contracts. A dual validation
is performed by which the service element of the contract is reviewed against a sim-only service offering. The group maximises the use of
external inputs to assess the reasonableness of the standalone selling prices by observing the standalone prices for similar goods and
services when sold by third parties.

Customers typically pay upfront for handsets, in advance for prepay and monthly for postpay and other communication services. Where
the customer pays a value less than that of the RRP of the handset upfront, the balance is deemed to be paid over the term of the related
service agreement. When revenue recognised in respect of a customer contract exceeds amounts received or receivable from a customer
at that time a contract asset is recognised; contract assets will typically be recognised for handsets or other equipment provided to customers
where payment is recovered by the group via future service fees. If amounts received or receivable from a customer exceed revenue
recognised for a contract, for example if the group receives an advance payment from a customer, a contract liability is recognised. When
contract assets or liabilities are recognised, a financing component may exist in the contract. The group avails of a practical expedient to
exclude significant financing on the basis that the amounts are immaterial, arising from an assessment which was carried out on handsets,
contract duration and interest rates on the open market.

These handset values are recognised upfront since ownership of the handset passes to the customer on date of inception of the contract and
the values are then amortised against the service revenue component of the bundle delivered over the contract period. There is not
considered to be a significant risk of material adjustment to the carrying value of contract-related assets or liabilities in the 12 months after
the balance sheet date if these estimates were revised. The group avails of practical expedients to exclude contracts of duration of 12
months or less, as almost all contracts are of 18 and 24 month duration.

Impairment losses are calculated separately from other expected credit loss provisions under IFRS 9 – churn is reviewed on an annual basis
and these percentages are built into the contract asset valuation model so that losses are written off immediately and not capitalised to the
balance sheet.

The group is required to interconnect its networks with other telecommunications operators. In some instances, as is normal practice in the
telecommunications industry, reliance is placed on other operators to measure the traffic flows interconnecting with the group’s networks.
The prices at which services are charged are regulated and can be subject to retrospective adjustment. Revenue from interconnect fees is
recognised at the time the services are performed.

_For the Year Ended 31 December 2022_

**3.** **Accounting policies - continued**

**3.6.** **Revenue recognition - continued**
Fixed line revenue is recognised in the period earned by rendering of services or delivery of products. Fixed line revenues largely comprise
access, voice traffic, data services and managed services. Traffic revenue is recognised at the time the traffic is carried over the group’s
networks and revenue from rentals is recognised evenly over the period to which the charges relate and over the life of the contract. Billings
for fixed telephony services are made on a monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly basis. Mobile revenue consists principally of charges to
customers for traffic from mobile network services, revenue from providing network services to other telecommunications operators, and
the sale of handsets and other accessories. Payment terms are typically 14 days from invoice date and 30 days for business customers.
Unbilled revenues from the billing cycle date to the end of each month are recognised as revenue during the month the service is provided.

Where Customer Premises Equipment (‘CPE’) is part of the bundled revenue – an assessment is undertaken to attach a market value to the
equipment provided. In the case of modems, the life of the equipment is deemed to be 5 years which spans multiple customer contracts,
which are 12 months in duration, and therefore immaterial. Modems are returned at the end of the customer contract, with a charge levied
on customers who do not adhere. These are refurbished on return at minimum cost and re-issued to a new customer. In the case of TV set
top boxes, there is no market value as the provider is contractually obliged not to provide the software necessary to an end customer to
enable them to use this equipment with any other provider’s service other than the group’s.

Bundled products (broadband, line rentals and traffic) are accounted for in the same manner as the unbundled products comprising the
bundle. Revenue from the sale of bundled service products is allocated to the separate elements of the bundle on the basis of each element’s
relative stand-alone selling price basis as described above and recognised in revenue when each individual element of the product or service
is provided. The fair values of each element are determined based on the current market price of the service when sold separately.
Additionally, when allocating the bundled revenue to each element, amounts contingent upon provision of future service are not allocated
to delivered elements. To the extent that there is a discount in the bundled product, such discount is allocated between the elements of the
contract in such a manner as to reflect the fair value of each element and is embedded in a reduced price to the customer.

Revenue arising from the provision of other services, including maintenance contracts, data hosting and other related professional services,
is recognised over the term of the contract.

Revenue arising from the provision of build to suit services of mast sites is recognised when eir fulfills its contractual obligations and the
assets are live and acceptance from the counterparty has occurred.

Refunds and credits are recorded in the period to which they relate as a deduction to revenue, but are limited and infrequent in nature since
eligible return periods are short and under strict criteria, for example faulty handsets within a 14 day period. Warranties are provided to
the customer by the manufacturer, hence there is no exposure to the group.

When costs directly relating to a specific contract are incurred prior to recognising revenue for a related obligation, these costs are
recognised in the income statement as expenses in line with the recognition of revenue when the related obligation is delivered, over the
life of the contract. The costs of acquiring a contract including commission payable for acquiring customers on behalf of the group, are
recognised as contract acquisition cost assets as prepaid and deferred.

**3.7.** **Exceptional items**
The group has adopted an income statement format which seeks to highlight significant or one-off items within group results for the year.
The group believe that this presentation provides additional analysis as it highlights significant or one-off items. Such items include
restructuring costs, curtailment gains and losses in respect of pensions, charges in respect of certain management incentive plans,
impairment of assets (including goodwill), gains/losses on exit from subsidiary, onerous contracts and reinstatement/dilapidation
provisions. Judgement is used by the group in assessing the particular items, which, by virtue of their scale and nature, are disclosed in the
group income statement and related notes as exceptional items.

**3.8.** **Amounts paid and payable to other operators**
Amounts paid and payable to other operators are mainly settlement fees that the group pays to other telecommunications operators for
traffic that is routed on their networks. Costs associated with these payments are recognised in the period in which the traffic is carried.

**3.9.** **Customer acquisition costs**
The group pays commissions to dealers for the acquisition and retention of mobile subscribers and certain fixed line products. Customer
acquisition costs are recorded as an asset and amortised either as an expense or a reduction to revenue depending on handset value, over
the period of the relevant contracts under IFRS 15.

The cost of mobile handsets is recorded as an expense in the period of purchase.

The costs associated with the group’s advertising and marketing activities are expensed as incurred.

**3.10.** **Foreign currencies**
_Functional and presentation currency_
Items included in the financial statements of each of the group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic
environment in which the entities operate (‘the functional currency’). These consolidated financial statements are presented in euro, which
is the group’s presentation currency and is denoted by the symbol “€”.

_Transactions and balances_
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the retranslation at period-end exchange
rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in
the statement of other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges.

_Group entities_
The results and financial position of all the group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are
translated into the presentation currency as follows:

- assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;

- income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable
approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are
translated at the dates of the transactions); and

- all resulting exchange differences are recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income.

**3.11.** **Taxation**
The company is managed and controlled in Ireland and, consequently, is tax resident in Ireland.

Current tax is calculated on the profits of the period. Current tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) in effect during the relevant
financial period.

Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities
and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, if the deferred tax arises from initial recognition of an asset
or liability in a transaction, other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable
profit or loss, it is not accounted for. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted, or substantively enacted
by the balance sheet date, and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.

Deferred tax is recognised in other comprehensive income, if the tax relates to items that are credited or charged, in the same or a different
period, in other comprehensive income.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary
differences can be utilised.

**3.12.** **Financial instruments**
_(i)_ _Borrowings_
All borrowings are initially stated at the fair value of the consideration received after deduction of transaction costs. Borrowings are
subsequently stated at amortised cost. Any difference between the fair value on initial recognition and the redemption value is recognised
in the income statement over the period of borrowings using the effective interest method. When it is not possible to estimate reliably the
cash flows or the expected life of a financial instrument (or group of financial instruments), the group uses the contractual cash flows over
the full contractual term of the financial instrument (or group of financial instruments).

Where the terms of borrowings are amended, if the revised terms are substantially different from the original terms, the transaction is
accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability. The terms are
considered to be substantially different if the discounted present value of the cash flows under the new terms, including any fees paid net
of any fees received and discounted using the original effective interest rate, is at least 10% different from the discounted present value of
the remaining cash flows of the original financial liability. Any gain or loss on the extinguishment of the original liability is recognised
immediately in the income statement.

If the new terms are not substantially different from the original terms, the impact of the change in the cash flows on the financial liability
are recognised immediately in the income statement. The modification gain or loss is equal to the difference between the present value of
the cash flows under the original and modified terms discounted at the original effective interest rate. The carrying value of the financial
liability is adjusted for the modification gain or loss recognised immediately in the income statement and the effective interest rate is
revised to amortise the carrying value of the financial liability after modification over the modified liability revised contractual period.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities, unless the group has an unconditional right to defer settlement for the liability for at least
12 months from the balance sheet date.

_(ii)_ _Financial assets at amortised cost_
Financial assets at amortised cost are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active
market. They are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost and are included in current assets, except
for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. The group’s financial assets at amortised cost are set out in
Note 28.

_(iii)_ _Derivative financial instruments_
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their
fair value at each subsequent balance sheet date. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is
designated as a hedging instrument, and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The group designates certain derivatives as hedges of
a particular risk associated with a recognised liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge).

The group documents, at the inception of the transaction, the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its
risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of
the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between
the hedged item and hedging instrument. A hedge ratio of one to one is established.

Derivative assets or liabilities are presented as current or non-current based on expected realisation or settlement dates.

_(iv)_ _Cash flow hedges_
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly
probable transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised in other comprehensive
income. Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised in the income statement.

Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement within finance costs in the periods when the hedged item affects
profit or loss. The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of interest rate swaps hedging variable rate borrowings is recognised in the
income statement within finance costs.

When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or
loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income
statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was recorded in equity is immediately
transferred to the income statement.

**3.** **Accounting policies - continued**

**3.13.** **Property, plant and equipment**
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost in the case of network
plant includes contractors’ charges, materials and labour and related overheads directly attributable to the cost of construction.

_Depreciation_
Depreciation is provided on property, plant and equipment (excluding land), on a straight-line basis, so as to write off their cost less residual
amounts over their estimated economic lives, from the date the asset is available for use. The estimated economic lives assigned to property,
plant and equipment are as follows:

**Asset Class** **Estimated**
**Economic**

**Life (Years)**


**Buildings**

**Network Plant**

**Transmission Equipment**

Duct
Overhead cable/poles
Underground cable

Other local network

**Others**


40

20

8-15

14

3.5-15

3-16


The group’s policy is to review the remaining economic lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment on an ongoing basis
and to adjust the depreciation charge prospectively to reflect the remaining estimated life and residual value.

Fully depreciated property, plant and equipment are retained in the cost of property, plant and equipment and related accumulated
depreciation until they are removed from service. In the case of disposals, cost of assets and related accumulated depreciation are removed
from the financial statements and the net amount, less proceeds from disposal, is charged or credited to the income statement.

_Assets in the course of construction_
Assets in the course of construction represent the cost of purchasing, constructing and installing property, plant and equipment ahead of
their own productive use. No depreciation is charged on assets in the course of construction. The estimated amount of interest incurred,
directly attributable to constructing qualifying assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use,
is capitalised based on the weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings.

_Asset retirement obligations_
The group has certain obligations in relation to the retirement of assets, mainly poles, batteries and international cable. The group also has
obligations to dismantle base stations and to restore the property owned by third parties on which the stations are situated after the stations
are removed. The group capitalises the discounted future cash flows associated with these asset retirement obligations and depreciates these
assets over the useful life of the related asset.

**3.14.** **Impairment of non financial assets – group**
Assets that have an indefinite useful life, principally goodwill, and intangible assets not yet available for use, are not subject to amortisation,
and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation and depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable
amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped
at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). If a cash generating unit is impaired,
provision is made to reduce the carrying amount of the related assets to their estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are allocated
firstly against goodwill and secondly against the other assets (including other intangible assets) in the cash generating unit on a pro-rata
basis based on the carrying amount of each asset in the cash generating unit.

Non financial assets, other than goodwill, that suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting
date. Impairment losses recognised in respect of goodwill are not reversed in any circumstances.

**3.15.** **Leased assets**
The group assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the right to control the
use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

_Where the group is lessee_
The group applies lease accounting under IFRS 16 for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low value assets. The group
recognises lease liabilities to make lease payments and right of use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets. The group
have established three classes of assets, Mobile Cell Sites, Vehicles and Property.

(i) **Right of use assets**
The group recognises right of use assets at the commencement date of the lease (the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right
of use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease
liabilities. The cost of right of use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments
made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received and costs to dismantle/retire the asset at a future date. Right
of use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets, recognising
a full month’s depreciation in the month of contract inception and none in the month of contract termination.

If ownership of the leased asset transfers to the group at the end of the lease term or the cost reflects the exercise of a purchase option,
depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of the asset. The right of use assets are also subject to impairment (refer to 3.14).
The group’s right of use assets are included in Note 17.

(ii) **Lease liabilities**
At the commencement date of the lease, the group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made
over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives
receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees.
The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the group and payments of
penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the group exercising the option to terminate. The group separates the lease
component from non-lease components of the contract in all class of assets.

Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses (unless they are incurred to produce inventories)
in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.

In calculating the present value of lease payments, the group uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date for classes
of assets, Mobile Cell sites and Property because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. Incremental borrowing
rates are calculated using a portfolio approach, where the group treats assets under a common lease contract with the same contract terms
collectively. The group uses the implicit rate determinable in the lease for the Vehicles class of asset. After the commencement date, the
amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying
amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the lease payments (changes to
future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine such lease payments) or a change in the assessment of an
option to purchase the underlying asset. The group’s lease liabilities are included in Note 17.

(iii) **Short-term leases and leases of low value assets**
The group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases (those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or
less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). For leases that are out of contract but expected to continue past
a 12 month period, the group uses the expected commercial lease extension as the lease term or if not determinable, a period of no longer
than 5 years, reviewed periodically. The group applies the lease of low value assets recognition exemption to leases that are considered to
be low value. Lease payments on leases of low value assets are recognised as expense in the period they relate to.

_Where the group is lessor_
Leases in which the group does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset are classified as
operating leases. Rental income arising is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and is included in revenue in the
income statement due to its operating nature. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the
carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised over the lease term on the same basis as rental income. Contingent rents are recognised
as revenue in the period in which they are earned.

**3.16.** **Inventories**
Inventories comprise mainly consumable items and goods held for resale. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable
value. Cost is calculated on a weighted average basis and includes invoice price, import duties and transportation costs. Where necessary,
write-downs in the carrying value of inventories are made for damaged, deteriorated, obsolete and unusable items, on the basis of a review
of individual items included in inventory. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the
estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

**3.17.** **Trade and other receivables**
Trade and other receivables are recognised at fair value, which is normally the original invoiced amount or amount advanced, less any
provision for expected credit losses. The group has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience,
adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced
through the use of the provision for expected credit losses, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement in “operating
costs”. When a trade receivable or other receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the provision for expected credit losses.

Trade receivables are reviewed regularly to assess the adequacy of the provision for expected credit losses in accordance with IFRS 9. The
simplified approach to providing for expected credit losses has been applied to trade receivables, which requires the use of a lifetime
expected loss provision. The credit loss rates used are based on actual collection statistics and applied to each aged debt bracket to ascertain
the provision for expected credit losses. The regular reviews of trade receivables will reduce any differences between loss estimates and
actual loss experience.

**3.18.** **Cash and cash equivalents**
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, and other short-term highly liquid investments with
original maturity of less than three months.

**3.19.** **Indefeasible rights of use (“IRU”)**
The group accounts for IRU contracts in the following manner:

(i) A contract arrangement that is for the capacity portion of an asset that is not physically distinct and does not represent substantially all
of the capacity of the asset and thereby does not provide the customer with the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits
from use of the asset is accounted for as a service and does not contain a lease pursuant to IFRS 16. These contracts arrangements have a
single performance obligation of providing capacity and revenue is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the relevant
contracts.

(ii) In the case of IRU arrangement containing a performance obligation to build fibre on behalf of the customer, comprising of a physically
distinct asset for which the customer has control, revenue is recognised at each stage of the completed build.

**3.20.** **Employee benefits**

(i) _Pension obligations_
Group companies operate various pension schemes. The schemes are generally funded through payments determined by periodic actuarial
calculations to independent trustee-administered funds. The group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.

A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the group pays fixed contributions into a separate fund. Under defined
contribution plans, the group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets
to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. The contributions are recognised as employee
benefit expense when they are due.

Typically, defined benefit plans define an amount of future pension benefit that employees have earned in return for their services to date.
The pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement is usually dependent on factors such as age, years of service and
compensation. The amount recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the group’s
defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date, less the fair value of plan assets. Plan assets are valued at their market value at the
balance sheet date using bid values. The defined benefit obligation, and the related current service cost, and, where applicable, past service
cost, are calculated by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually
unless there has been a material change in the obligations, where it is then recalculated during the year. The present value of the defined
benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using an appropriate discount rate based on current
market yields at the balance sheet date of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in euros, and reflect the duration of the related
pension liability.

The amounts of current service cost and net interest cost recognised in the income statement are computed based on actuarial assumptions
at the start of the financial year. Costs of administering the defined benefit plans, other than investment management costs, are recognised
within operating expenses in the income statement as the administrative services are received. Past service costs and negative past service
costs are recognised immediately in the group income statement.

Actuarial gains and losses, arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions, are charged or credited directly to
reserves through the statement of other comprehensive income.

Settlements and curtailments trigger immediate recognition of the consequent change in obligations and related assets or liabilities in the
group income statement. Before the effect of a curtailment or settlement is determined, the defined benefit obligation is re-measured using
current actuarial assumptions.

Under the Defined Benefit Trust Deed, the group is entitled to the surplus assets in the main superannuation fund in the event of a windup of the defined benefit scheme.

The deferred tax impact of pension plan surpluses and deficits is disclosed separately within the deferred tax assets or
liabilities, as appropriate.

(ii) _Other bonus plans_
The group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses where contractually obliged, or where there is past practice that has created a
constructive obligation. The entitlement to bonuses under long term bonus plans is usually conditional on the completion of a minimum
service period. The expected costs of the bonuses are accrued over the period of employment based on estimates of the ultimate amount
payable and targets under the schemes.

(iii) _Termination benefits_
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee
accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The group recognises termination benefits at the earlier of the following: (a)
when the group can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits; or (b) when the entity recognises costs for a restructuring that is within
the scope of IAS 37 and involves the payment of termination benefits. Termination benefits comprise the estimated benefits payable to
staff availing of voluntary leaving schemes and the associated pension impact.

**3.** **Accounting policies – continued**

**3.21.** **Provisions**
A provision is recognised when, and only when (a) the group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, (b)
it is probable (i.e. more likely than not) that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation,
and (c) a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering
the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in
the same class of obligations may be small.

Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due
to passage of time is recognised as an interest expense.

A constructive obligation for restructuring cost exists where plans are sufficiently detailed and well advanced, and where appropriate
communication to those affected has been undertaken on or before the balance sheet date.

If the group has a contract that is onerous, the present obligation under the contract is recognised and measured as a provision. However,
before a separate provision for an onerous contract is established, the group recognises any impairment loss that has occurred on assets
dedicated to that contract. An onerous contract is a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting its obligations under the contract
exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under the contract. The unavoidable costs under a contract reflect the least net cost
of exiting from the contract, which is the lower of the cost of fulfilling the contract and any compensation or penalties arising from failure
to fulfil the contract.

**3.22.** **Financial guarantee contracts**
Liabilities are initially measured at fair value in respect of financial guarantees issued by the group for the benefit of third parties, and
subsequently at the higher of the amount determined in accordance with IAS 37, “Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets”
and the amount initially recognised less cumulative amortisation, where appropriate.

**3.23.** **Contingent liabilities and contingent assets**
A contingent liability, including contingent liabilities in respect of financial guarantee contracts, is a possible obligation that arises from
past events and the existence of which will only be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events
not wholly within the control of the group, or a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised because: (a) it is not
probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, or (b) the amount of the
obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. A contingent liability is not recognised but is disclosed in the notes to the financial
statements.

A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or
non-occurrence of one or more uncertain events not wholly within the control of the group. Contingent assets are not recognised but are
disclosed in the notes to the financial statements when an inflow of economic benefits is probable. When inflow is virtually certain an asset
is recognised.

**3.24.** **Share capital**
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction,
net of tax, from the proceeds.

**3.25.** **Dividend distribution**
Final dividend distributions to equity shareholders are recognised as a distribution in the group’s financial statements in the period in which
the dividends are approved by the equity shareholders. Interim dividend distributions to equity shareholders are recognised as a distribution
in the group’s financial statements in the period in which the dividends are declared.

**3.26.** **Investments**
Investments in subsidiaries included in the company balance sheet are shown at cost less provision for impairment. Investments in
subsidiaries are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the subsidiary’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the subsidiary’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Investments that have suffered
impairment losses are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.

**3.27.** **Dividends**
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.

**3.28.** **Held for sale**
The group classifies non-current assets and disposal groups as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through
a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the
lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. The criteria for held for sale classification is regarded as met only when the
sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition. The group must be committed
to the plan to sell the asset and the sale expected to be completed within one year from the date of the classification.

Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are presented separately as current items in the balance sheet.

**4.** **Financial risk management**

**Financial risk factors**
The group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: liquidity risk, market risk (including cash flow, interest rate risk, currency
risk and price risk) and credit risk. The group’s overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets, and
seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the group. The group uses different methods to measure different
types of risk to which it is exposed. These methods include sensitivity analysis in the case of interest rate risks, and ageing analysis for
credit risk. Responsibility for managing these risks rests with the Board.

On 30 June 2022, the group entered into new Facility B borrowings of €765 million, which are subject to a Senior Facilities Agreement,
with a maturity date of 30 June 2029. Transaction costs of €18 million directly attributable to the new borrowings have been deferred to
the balance sheet and will be amortised over the expected life of the borrowings through finance costs in the income statement using the
effective interest method under IFRS 9.

In accordance with the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement for the Facility B borrowings of €765 million, the group is required to
hedge its exposure to interest rate risk on not less than 70 per cent of its €765 million debt. During the period, the group entered into four
interest rate swaps with a notional principal amount of €536 million with a maturity date of 31 May 2026.

Also, during the year, the group prepaid €50 million of the principal amount of the Facility B borrowings with a maturity date of 15 May
2026. The prepayment of Facility B borrowings was accounted for as an extinguishment of debt and resulted in an accounting gain of €3
million in the income statement within ‘finance costs - net’.

In addition, the group redeemed €160 million of the 3.5% Senior Secured Notes due 2026, €70 million of the 1.75% Senior Secured Notes
due 2024 and €69 million of the 2.625% Senior Secured Notes due 2027 in the year ended 31 December 2022. In total the group repurchased
€299 million of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes for cash of €271 million resulting in a gain of €28 million and the discount
on redemption of Senior Secured Notes was included in the income statement within ‘finance costs - net’.

In the year ended 31 December 2022, dividend distributions totalling €800 million were paid to the equity shareholder, Wexford Limited.

There have been no other significant changes in the types of financial risks or the group’s risk management program (including methods
used to measure the risks) since 31 December 2021.

**4.1. Liquidity risk**
The objective of liquidity management is to ensure the availability of sufficient funds to meet the group’s requirements and to repay
maturing debt and other liabilities as they fall due.

As set out in Note 2, having reviewed the group’s business plans and cash flow forecasts, the Directors consider that the group will be able
to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the ordinary course of business for the foreseeable future. Management of the group’s
liquidity risk is fundamental to its operations. The nature of the group’s business, its working capital management activities and investment
in network assets has often resulted in minimal current assets or net current liabilities.

The eircom Holdings (Ireland) Limited group has net current assets of €215 million at 31 December 2022. The current liabilities
at that date include deferred revenue of €128 million. There is no cash outflow requirement associated with deferred revenue.

**4.2.** **Capital risk management**
The group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the group’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can provide
returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders over the long term. The capital structure of the group consists of the borrowings
as set out above, and equity comprising issued capital, reserves and accumulated losses as set out in the ‘Group statement of changes in
equity’.

**4.3.** **Credit risk**
Credit risk refers to the loss that the group would incur if a debtor or other counter-party fails to perform under its contractual obligations.
Credit risks are mainly related to counter-party risks associated with cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, trade receivables, other
debtors, amounts owed by related companies and derivative contracts.

The group’s trade receivables are generated by a large number of customers, both private individuals and companies in various industries,
mainly in Ireland. Exposure to credit loss and subscriber fraud is actively monitored on a regular basis, including some processing of
current credit information on subscribers from third-party sources (subject to availability) and, where appropriate, a provision for expected
credit losses is made.

The credit risk and net exposure on key accounts, particularly other authorised operators and international carriers, is monitored separately
through continual risk assessments of customers with material balances. In terms of the overall exposure from credit risk, the receivables
from these counter-parties are not so extensive as to be considered significant concentrations of credit risk.

The group held collateral on trade receivables in the form of cash deposits of €15 million (31 December 2021: €15 million) as security.

The group is exposed to credit risk relating to its cash and cash equivalents. The group treasury policy is designed to limit exposure with
any one institution and to invest its excess cash in low risk investment accounts with authorised banking counter-parties and with
institutions whose long-term Standard & Poor’s (S&P) credit rating is “BBB+” or above (or Moody’s equivalent rating of “Baa1”) or is an

**4. Financial risk management – continued**

**4.4.** **Market risk**
Market risk refers to the exposure of the group’s financial position to movements in interest rates, currency rates and general price risk.
The group has limited exposure to equity, currency and price risk, other than the impact of those risks on the group’s defined benefit
pension scheme.

The principal aim of managing the interest rate risk is to limit the adverse impact on cash flows and shareholder value of movements in
interest rates.

Cash and cash equivalents and borrowings at variable rates expose the group to cash flow interest rate risk. Cash and cash equivalents and
borrowings at a fixed rate expose the group to fair value interest rate risk.

On 30 June 2022, the group entered into new Facility B borrowings of €765 million and in accordance with the terms of the Senior Facilities
Agreement, the group is required to hedge its exposure to interest rate risk on not less than 70 per cent of its €765 million debt. During the
period, the group entered into four interest rate swaps with a notional principal amount of €536 million with a maturity date of 31 May
2026. These swaps have the effect of fixing the floating rate part of the interest rate payable under €536 million of the group’s €765 million
Facility B debt to 1.463% for €383 million (effective date 31 August 2022) and 2.563% for €153 million (effective date 30 November
2022) for the duration of the swaps.

As at reporting date, the group had the following cash and cash equivalents (Note 25) and floating-rate borrowings (Note 29):

**31 December 2021** **31 December 2022**

**Weighted** **Balance** **Weighted** **Balance**

**average** **average**

**Interest rate** **Interest rate**

**%** **€m** **%** **€m**


Cash and cash equivalents -0.5% 287 **1.7%** **507**

Bank borrowings (Facility B) 3.0% (1,100) **4.8%** **(1,050)**

Bank borrowings (FNI Facility B) - **4.2%** **(765)**

Interest rate swaps (Notional principal amount) - **536**

**Net exposure to interest rate risk** (813) **(772)**

**Interest rate sensitivity analysis**
Based on the financial instruments held at the balance sheet date, if interest rates are 100 basis points (“bps”) higher/lower and all other
variables are held constant, the group’s profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2022 will increase or decrease by the amounts set
out in the table below:

**Group – after tax** **Increase by** **Decrease by**

**25 bps** **100 bps** **25 bps** **100 bps**

**31 Dec 2021** **31 Dec 2022** **31 Dec 2021** **31 Dec 2022**

**€’m** **€’m** **€’m** **€’m**


Profit for the year - (lower)/higher


(2)


**(7)**


**7**


2


A sensitivity of 100 bps (31 December 2021: 25 bps) has been selected as this is considered reasonable given the current level of both
short-term and long-term interest rates.

**Currency risk**
The group conducts its business primarily in Ireland and, therefore, operating and investing cash flows are substantially denominated in
euro. A limited level of foreign exchange risk arises in relation to a foreign subsidiary, capital expenditure denominated in foreign
currencies and foreign exchange settlements with international third party telecommunications carriers.

Given the limited level of risk the group does not hedge its foreign exchange risk arising on transactions and capital expenditure
denominated in foreign currencies.

**Price risk**
The group is exposed to price risk on the assets held by the group’s defined benefit pension scheme (see Note 38).

**4.** **Financial risk management – continued**

**4.5.** **Fair value estimation**
The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on the quoted market prices at the balance sheet date. IFRS 13
requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level based on the following fair value measurement hierarchy:

**Level 1 comprises financial assets and liabilities valued using quoted market prices in active markets at the balance sheet date. An active**
market is one in which transactions occur with sufficient volume and frequency to provide pricing information on an arm’s length basis on
an on-going basis.

**Level 2 comprises financial assets and liabilities valued using techniques based significantly on observable market data. These valuation**
techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates.

**Level 3 comprises financial assets and liabilities valued using techniques where the impact of the non-observable market data is significant**
in determining the fair value of the instrument.

The fair value of borrowings is disclosed in Notes 29.

**4.6.** **Hedging instruments**
As at the reporting date, the group has entered into a number of swaps to cover interest rate exposure on its new Facility B borrowings of
€765 million. These instruments have been designated as cash flow hedges and movements in the effective portion of the fair value of the
hedges have been taken through the cash flow hedge reserve.

**Derivatives designated and eligible for hedge accounting**
The details of the effective interest rate and maturity of these designated and effective hedging instruments are:

**Maturity date – principal value**


**Principal**

**value**


**Fair** **Weighted** **Within** **Between** **Between** **Between** **Between** **After**

**Value** **average** **1 Year** **1 & 2** **2 & 3** **3 & 4** **4 & 5** **5 Years**

**Interest** **Years** **Years** **Years** **Years**

 - at 31 December 2021 - - - - - - - - 
The effective interest rates in the table above are based on the effective interest rates in the derivative financial instruments designated for
cash flow hedging. This does not equate to the effective interest rate on the underlying debt as it excludes the margin over EURIBOR,
payable in respect of the €765 million Facility B borrowings. The margin on the €765 million facility is 2.25% over EURIBOR for the first
three years, 2.5% for year four and five, 2.75% for year six and 3% for year seven.

Further information on the group's use of interest rate swaps is included in Note 26.

**5.** **Critical Accounting Judgements and Estimates**

The group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal
the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities are noted below. Further details are included in the Notes to the financial statements.

The areas involving significant estimates or judgements are:

- Accounting treatment for exit from subsidiary/joint venture (Note 9)

- Estimation of current tax payable and recognition of deferred tax (Note 13)

- Making appropriate assumptions on non-financial asset impairment reviews (Note 14)

- Establishing lives for amortisation purposes of intangible assets (Note 15)

- Establishing lives for depreciation purposes of property, plant and equipment (Note 16)

- Providing for expected credit losses (Note 22)

- Allocation of revenue between performance obligations (Note 23)

- Estimation of cash outflows on onerous lease contracts (Note 31(a))

- Making appropriate assumptions in calculating asset retirement obligations (Note 31 (c))

- Providing for litigation, contingencies and other constructive obligations (Note 31 (e))

- Making appropriate long-term assumptions in calculating pension liabilities, surpluses and costs (Note 38)

- Assigning fair values to assets and liabilities acquired through business combinations (Note 43)

Judgements and estimates are continually evaluated. They are based on historical experiences and other factors, including expectations of
future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

**6.** **Segment information**

IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the group which are regularly
reviewed by the ‘Chief Operating Decision Maker’ in order to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.

The group’s operating segments are reported based on financial information provided to the Senior Management Team (“SMT”), which is
the key management team and represents the ‘Chief Operating Decision Maker’. The SMT is chaired by the Group Chief Executive and
the other members are the Group Chief Financial Officer, Chief Technology Officer, Chief Information Officer, Business Directors,
Customer Operations Director, HR Director, Director of Regulatory & Public Policy and General Counsel.

The SMT considers the business from a fixed line and mobile perspective and assesses the performance of the operating segments based
on a measure of adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is before non-cash lease contracts, non-cash pension charge and exceptional items.
This measurement basis excludes the effects of significant or non-recurring expenditure from the operating segments such as restructuring
costs, curtailment gains and losses in respect of pensions, charges in respect of certain management incentive plans, impairment of assets
(including goodwill), gains/losses on exit from subsidiary undertaking/joint venture and onerous contracts. The non-cash lease contracts
credit included in the income statement during the period is in respect of the unfavourable lease fair value adjustment which arose on
acquisition of eircom Limited. The non-cash pension charge is determined based on the difference between the charge determined under
IAS 19 and employer contributions payable in respect of the financial year. Interest costs on borrowings are not allocated to segments, as
this type of activity is driven by the central treasury function, which manages the borrowings position of the group.

Sales between segments for telecommunication services are carried out on an arm’s length basis. Other recharges in respect of nontelecommunication services are based on actual cost of employee remuneration or other external costs incurred. The revenue from external
parties reported to the SMT is measured in a manner consistent with that in the group income statement.

The segment results for the year ended 31 December 2022 are as follows:

**Significant estimates and judgements**
There was significant judgement involved in determining the accounting for the exit. The group determined that as the assets sold with the
business were different in nature to the assets leased from PTI subsequent to the sale, the sale and lease would be accounted for separately,
with the gain, (net of impairment for lease rates in excess of market; and liabilities to exit) of €174 million being credited to income upon
exit and right of use assets being recognised for the full value of the capacity leased back from PTI of €251 million with a corresponding
amount recognised as lease liabilities. The alternative accounting would have been not to recognise the gross amount of right of use assets
and lease liabilities for the capacity leased back but to allocate the proceeds principally between the amount to be recognised as financial
liability for future payments for the leases including a financing element for rates in excess of markets, and a gain on exit calculated as the
proportion of rights considered transferred to PTI.

Significant estimation is required in respect of the determination of the financing adjustment recognised in respect of leasing arrangement
of €111 million in terms of determining market related rates.

The group prepaid €50 million of the principal amount of the Facility B borrowings during the year ended 31 December 2022 which
resulted in a gain on extinguishment of debt of €3 million. This is the difference between the fair value of the consideration paid to
extinguish the liability and the carrying value of the liability at that date.

The group redeemed €160 million of the 3.5% Senior Secured Notes due 2026, €70 million of the 1.75% Senior Secured Notes due 2024
and €69 million of the 2.625% Senior Secured Notes due 2027 in the year ended 31 December 2022. In total the group repurchased €299
million of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes for cash of €271 million resulting in a gain and this is included in the income
statement as discount on redemption of Senior Secured Notes of €28 million.

**(c)** **Significant estimates and judgements**

_Current tax_
The actual tax the group pays is determined according to complex tax laws and regulations. Where the effect of these laws and regulations
are unclear, the group uses estimates in determining the liability for the tax to be paid. The group believes the estimates, assumptions and
judgements are reasonable but the estimates can involve complex issues which may take a number of years to resolve. The final
determination of tax liabilities could be different from the estimates reflected in the financial statements and may result in the recognition
of an additional tax expense or tax credit in the income statement in future periods. The value of the group’s current tax liability is disclosed
on the balance sheet.

_Deferred tax_
Deferred tax assets and liabilities require management judgement in determining the amounts to be recognised. In particular, judgement is
used when assessing the extent to which deferred tax assets should be recognised with consideration given to the timing and level of future
taxable income. The carrying value of the group’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are disclosed in Notes 19 and 30, respectively.

Goodwill is not subject to amortisation. Instead, goodwill is tested for impairment annually as part of the cash generating unit (“CGU”) to
which it relates, and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

The majority of the group’s goodwill carried forward from prior years relates to the acquisition of eircom Limited in June 2012, pursuant
to a Scheme of Arrangement of creditors approved by the High Court. The company acquired 100% of the share capital of eircom Limited
for consideration of €1. Goodwill of €836 million was recognised as the difference between the purchase consideration and the fair value
of the individual assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition, 11 June 2012. The goodwill arose in part because eircom Limited was
acquired for a nominal amount pursuant to the Scheme of Arrangement and because the pension obligation and the deferred tax balances
were recognised in accordance with the measurement requirements of IAS 19 and IAS 12 respectively and not at fair value. No goodwill
was allocated to the Mobile CGU. The group identified an impairment of €542 million in the year ended 30 June 2012 relating to the Fixed
Line CGU.

In the year ended 30 June 2013, eircom Limited sold its 100% shareholding in eircom Phonewatch Limited and recognised disposal of
goodwill of €102 million as a result of the transaction.

On 1 April 2016, the group acquired 100% of the share capital of Setanta Sports Channel Ireland Limited (a company incorporated in
Ireland) as well as the Irish residential subscriber business and assets of Setanta Sports Hibernia Sàrl (together “Setanta Sports Ireland”).
Goodwill of €20 million was recognised on the acquisition of Setanta Sports Ireland and allocated to the group’s Fixed Line CGU. In the
period ended 31 December 2021, the group made the decision to discontinue eir Sport and impaired the Setanta Sports Ireland goodwill of
€20 million that was allocated to the Fixed Line CGU.

On 1 March 2021, the group acquired 100% of the share capital of Evros Technology Group, a leading IT services provider, based in
Ireland. Goodwill of €50 million was provisionally recognised on the acquisition. The fair values have now been finalised and €43 million
was recognised as the goodwill on the acquisition of Evros Technology Group and allocated to the group’s Fixed Line CGU.

The CGU summary of the goodwill allocation is as follows:
**Fixed Line** **Mobile** **Fixed Line** **Mobile**

**Impairment test of Fixed Line CGU as at 31 December 2022**
An impairment test of the Fixed Line CGU was performed as at 31 December 2022 in accordance with IAS 36, Impairment of Assets. The
impairment test has been undertaken at the year end date. Tangible and intangible assets are an integrated part of the CGU carrying values
and are tested together with the goodwill. No impairment was identified.

An impairment test of the Fixed Line CGU is required annually as it contains goodwill. An impairment test of the Mobile CGU is not
required as at 31 December 2022 as the group held no Mobile intangible assets not yet available for use for which the recoverable amount
could not be estimated on an individual asset basis. The Directors concluded that there was no indicator of impairment and consequently
no test of impairment was required to be performed.

##### Notes to the Financial Statements
_For the Year Ended 31 December 2022_

**14. Goodwill - continued**

**_Impairment testing methodology_**
The recoverable amount of the CGU is determined on the basis of the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and value-inuse, using the discounted cash flow (DCF) method. Cash flows for the years beyond the approved business plans are
extrapolated using the estimated long-term growth rates stated below. The cash flows are discounted using the discount rates
stated below.

The cash flows and assumptions used as of 31 December 2022 for the impairment test are consistent with the assumptions
that would be made by a market participant acquiring the CGU.

_Key assumptions_
The key assumptions are based on past experience, adjusted for expected changes in future conditions. Key assumptions
involved in the calculation of value in use include management’s estimates of future operating cash-flows, capital expenditure
requirements, tax considerations, discount rates and long-term growth rates. The key assumptions in relation to long-term
growth rates and discount rates were benchmarked against external information on comparable companies in similar markets.

The group considers the business plan and long-term projections to be reasonable in view of the anticipated long-term performance of the
Irish economy and consistent with the assumptions that would be used by a market participant. Adjustments are made to the business plan
cash flows to take account of possible variations in the amount or timing of cash flows, which can be affected by factors such as increased
competitor activity, the roll-out of new technologies and the timing of the introduction of new services, pricing trends, termination rates,
customer acquisition costs, margin levels and restructuring programmes, such that the estimated cash flows reflect the range of possible
outcomes for each CGU’s future trading performance.

_Cash flow projections_
At 31 December 2022 and 31 December 2021, these calculations used post-tax cash flow projections based on business plans approved by
management, as adjusted for market participant assumptions, covering a period up to 31 December 2027.

The other key assumptions used for impairment for the Fixed Line and Mobile CGUs are as follows:

**Fixed Line** **Mobile** **Fixed Line** **Mobile**

**31 Dec 2021** **31 Dec 2021** **31 Dec 2022** **31 Dec 2022**

Long-term growth rates -0.75% N/A **-0.75%** **N/A**

Discount rates (Pre-tax) 5.56% N/A **5.29%** **N/A**

Discount rates (Post-tax) 4.87% N/A **4.63%** **N/A**

Budgeted EBITDA[1] 0.28% N/A **0.91%** **N/A**

Budgeted capital expenditure[2] 10%-24% N/A **25%** **N/A**

**Notes:**

1 Budgeted EBITDA is expressed as the compound annual growth rates over the periods covered by the business plans for all cash
generating units of the plans used for impairment testing.

2 Budgeted capital expenditure is expressed as the range of capital expenditure as a percentage of revenue (for all periods covered by the

business plans plus the terminal value).

_Long Term Growth Rates_
The long-term growth rates are determined based on the long-term historical growth rates of the sectors in which the CGUs operate, and
reflect an assessment of the long-term growth prospects of the sectors. The growth rates have been benchmarked against external data for
the relevant markets. None of the growth rates applied exceed the long-term historical average growth rates for those markets or sectors.

_Discount Rates_
The discount rates used reflect specific risks relating to the CGUs. The assumptions used have been benchmarked to externally available
data. The methodology is based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). At 31 December 2022, the yield on fifteen-year Irish
government bonds provided the basis for the risk free rate, which was then adjusted to take account of market risks specific to the CGUs.
The group has used Irish government bond yields as the basis for the risk-free rate in keeping with its observations of practices applied by
external market analysts in determining appropriate weighted average costs of capital for Irish companies. In estimating the discount rate
under CAPM, in addition to the risk-free rate, other inputs required are the equity market risk premium (that is the excess return required
over and above a risk free rate by an investor who is investing in the market as a whole) and the risk adjustment factor known as beta is
applied to reflect the risk of the specific CGU operations relative to the market as a whole. In determining the risk adjusted discount rate,
management has applied an adjustment for the risk of the group’s CGUs determined using an average of the observed betas of comparable
companies.

**Significant estimates and judgements**

_Making appropriate assumptions on non-financial asset impairment reviews_
The group undertakes a review for impairment of goodwill, intangible assets not yet available for use annually and for other non-financial
assets if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

Factors which the group consider could trigger an impairment include, but are not limited to the following: (1) significant negative industry
or economic trends, (2) current, historical or projected losses that demonstrate continuing losses, (3) results of fair market valuations
performed or (4) changes in key assumptions underpinning the fair value less cost to sell and value in use calculations. These impairment
charges under IFRS are based upon the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its recoverable amount, which is the higher of the
fair value less cost to sell and its value in use, based on discounted future cash flows. When an asset is not recoverable in full, impairment
is measured as the excess of carrying value over the recoverable amount of the long-life asset. Management incorporates estimates when
evaluating the carrying amount, the recoverable amount, the value in use and the fair value less cost to sell. Changes in these estimates
directly affect management’s assessment of whether an impairment charge is required and the amount of the impairment charge recorded.

The discount rate used in impairment testing is derived from a weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) which is impacted by interest
rates and market risk premiums, estimated for companies in the telecommunications sector. There is a risk that the WACC could increase
significantly in future periods, depending on market volatility. There is also a risk of deterioration in the budgeted future cash flows as a
result of the current economic environment.

Any significant deterioration in the budgeted future cash flows or changes in WACC or estimates in respect of terminal growth rates could
result in a further impairment of our goodwill and/or non-financial assets, which could have a further negative effect on operating profits
and assets. Future cash flows would not be impacted by any impairment provision.

**Significant estimates and judgements**
_Establishing lives for depreciation purposes of property, plant and equipment_
Long-life assets, consisting primarily of property, plant and equipment, comprise a significant portion of the total assets. The annual
depreciation charge depends primarily on the estimated lives of each type of asset and, in certain circumstances, estimates of fair values
and residual values. The Directors regularly review these asset lives and change them as necessary to reflect current thinking on remaining
lives in light of technological change, prospective economic utilisation, physical condition of the assets concerned and other factors that
may impact on the remaining useful lives of assets. Changes in asset lives can have a significant impact on depreciation charges for the
period. It is not practical to quantify the impact of changes in asset lives on an overall basis as asset lives are individually determined and
there are a significant number of asset lives in use. The impact of any change would vary significantly depending on the individual changes
in assets and the classes of assets impacted. For additional information see details of the useful lives set out in Note 3.13.

The fair values of trade and other receivables approximate to their carrying amounts.

The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of receivable mentioned above.

The amount of the provision for expected credit losses of trade receivables was €35 million as of 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021:
€30 million). Total additional provisions of €8 million (31 December 2021: €7 million) relate to individual expected credit losses of €Nil
(31 December 2021: €Nil) and collective expected credit losses of €8 million (31 December 2021: €7 million).

**Significant estimates and judgements**
_Providing for expected credit losses_
The group provides services to individuals and business customers on credit terms. The group expects that some debts due will not be paid
as a result of the default of a small number of customers. The group uses estimates based on historical and current experience in determining
the level of debts which may not be collected. These estimates include such factors as the current state of the Irish economy and particular
industry issues. If the Irish economy deteriorated or negative industry trends occurred, there might be an increase in the estimated level of
debts that may not be collected, which would negatively impact the operating results. Trade receivables are reviewed regularly to assess
the adequacy of the provision for expected credit losses in accordance with IFRS 9. The credit loss rates used are based on actual collection
statistics and applied to each aged debt bracket to ascertain the provision for expected credit losses. The regular reviews of trade receivables
will reduce any differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience.

**Allowance for expected credit losses**

**Significant estimates and judgements**
_Allocation of revenue between performance obligations_
The standalone price determined for the performance obligations within contracts materially impact the allocation of revenue between
performance obligations. The determination of the standalone price requires judgement and impacts the allocation of the transaction price
when revenue is recorded in cases where obligations are provided to customers at different times – for example, the allocation of revenue
between handsets, which are usually delivered up-front, and services which are typically delivered over the contract period.

**24.** **Restricted cash**
The restricted cash of €56 million (31 December 2021: €1 million) is in relation to cash lodged in respect of a spectrum licence application
of €55 million and €1 million for security in respect of ancillary facilities. The interest earned on these deposits, after deduction of any
taxation payable, is due to the group.

The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is €56 million (31 December 2021: €1 million).

bank deposits was 1.7%. These deposits had a weighted average maturity of 15 days.

The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents mentioned above.

within a three-level fair value hierarchy.

**Level 1 comprises financial assets and liabilities valued using quoted market prices in active markets at the balance sheet date. An active**
market is one in which transactions occur with sufficient volume and frequency to provide pricing information on an arm’s length basis on
an on-going basis.

**Level 2 comprises financial assets and liabilities valued using techniques based significantly on observable market data. These valuation**
techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates.

**Level 3 comprises financial assets and liabilities valued using techniques where the impact of the non-observable market data is significant**

_Bank borrowings (Facility B)_

At 31 December 2022, the group has Senior Bank borrowings (Facility B) of €1,050 million, which are subject to a Senior Facilities Agreement,
with a maturity date of 15 May 2026.

In May 2019, the group entered into new Facility B borrowings of €400 million under the existing Senior Facilities Agreement, with a maturity
date of 15 May 2026. The group used €200 million of the proceeds to prepay part of the non-extending Facility B1 borrowings. The group also
agreed an extension of €945 million of its existing Facility B borrowings to 15 May 2026. In July 2019, the group agreed an extension to its nonextending Facility B1 borrowings of €455 million by two years to 15 May 2026. There was no change to the interest terms and the Facility B
borrowings are still subject to cash-pay interest at the same rate. In October 2019, the group used the proceeds from the 1.75% Senior Secured
Notes issue to prepay €350 million of the Facility B borrowings. Then, in November 2019, the group used the proceeds from the 2.625% Senior
Secured Notes issue to prepay a further €350 million of the Facility B borrowings.

During the year ended 31 December 2022, the group prepaid €50 million of the principal amount of the Facility B borrowings with a maturity date
of 15 May 2026. The prepayment of Facility B borrowings was accounted for as an extinguishment of debt and resulted in an accounting gain of
€3 million in the income statement within ‘finance costs - net’.

_Bank borrowings (FNI Facility B)_
On 30 June 2022, Fibre Network Ireland Limited (‘FNI’) entered into new Facility B borrowings of €765 million, which are subject to a Senior
Facilities Agreement, with a maturity date of 30 June 2029. Transaction costs of €18 million directly attributable to the new borrowings have been
deferred to the balance sheet and will be amortised over the expected life of the borrowings through finance costs in the income statement using
the effective interest method under IFRS 9.

_Senior Secured Notes_
In May 2019, the group issued €750 million in Senior Secured Notes with a maturity date of 15 May 2026. The Notes are subject to fixed rate
cash-pay interest at 3.5% payable in semi-annual instalments in May and November each year. The Notes were issued by the group’s wholly owned
subsidiary, eircom Finance DAC. The Notes rank equally in priority of payment with the existing borrowings subject to the Senior Facilities
Agreement.

In October 2019, the group issued €350 million in Senior Secured Notes with a maturity date of 1 November 2024. These Notes are subject to
fixed rate cash-pay interest at 1.75% payable in semi-annual instalments in May and November each year. In November 2019, the group issued a
further €350 million in Senior Secured Notes with a maturity date of 15 February 2027 and the Notes are subject to fixed rate cash-pay interest at
2.625% payable in semi-annual instalments in May and November each year. The group used the €700 million proceeds from the Senior Secured
Notes to prepay part of the Facility B borrowings.

During the year ended 31 December 2022, the group redeemed €160 million of the 3.5% Senior Secured Notes due 2026, €70 million of the 1.75%
Senior Secured Notes due 2024 and €69 million of the 2.625% Senior Secured Notes due 2027 in the year ended 31 December 2022. In total the
group repurchased €299.4 million of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes for cash of €271.5 million and the gain of €28 million was
included in the income statement within ‘finance costs - net’ as discount on redemption of Senior Secured Notes.

Transaction costs are initially deferred and are subsequently amortised over the expected life of the borrowings through finance costs in the income
statement using the effective interest method under IFRS 9.

**(a)** **Onerous contracts**
The group has onerous contracts associated with vacant offices and leasehold properties, mainly arising from the liability recognised on
the acquisition of eircom Limited in June 2012 and the more recent operational restructurings. The group also has onerous contracts
associated with ongoing data centre operations.

The group transferred the onerous lease liabilities for rental and exit costs on transition to IFRS 16 to ‘Right of Use Assets’ as an impairment
of those assets. The remaining onerous contracts provision of €29 million (31 December 2021: €33 million) is mainly for rates, facilities
and services charges in relation to the leasehold properties.

At 31 December 2022, the liabilities are expected to be discharged over a period of one to eleven years, and these anticipated cash flows
are discounted using a risk free rate of return of between 2.2% and 2.4%.

**Significant estimates and judgements**
The group has estimated the future cash outflows arising from these onerous contracts. The estimation of outflows reflect current economic
conditions and estimates are used in determining the level of provisions required in respect of these leasehold properties.

**31.** **Provisions for other liabilities and charges - continued**

**(b)** **Temporary income stream (“TIS”) annuity scheme**
The eircom Limited group established an annuity scheme whereby employees participating in a voluntary termination scheme could accept
payment in one lump sum or as an annuity to be paid out over a period of ten years. The group estimates the annuity liability as the present
value of the fixed payment stream due to employees. At 31 December 2022, the remaining TIS annuity scheme provision is expected to be
substantially utilised over a period of six years.

**(c)** **Asset Retirement Obligations**
The group has provisions for costs arising from certain obligations in relation to the retirement and decommissioning of assets, mainly
certain poles, batteries, international cable and dismantling and restoration of mobile antenna sites. It is expected that most of these costs
will be paid during the period 2023 to 2037, and these anticipated cash flows are discounted using a risk free rate of return of between 2%
and 4%.

**Significant estimates and judgements**
Significant judgement is required in determining the amount and timing of cash flows associated with the asset retirement obligations as
some of the cash flows are anticipated up to 15 years in the future, and there has been no significant retirement or decommissioning costs
incurred to date. There are also ongoing changes in legislation which impact on the group’s assessment on the level of cost and the manner
in which certain asset retirement obligations can be met. Any adverse changes in legislation or interpretations of existing legislation could
have a significant impact on the group’s estimate of its asset retirement obligations.

**(d)** **Deferred Consideration/ Completion Scheme**
The deferred consideration arrangement arising on the business combination in the period ending 31 December 2021 requires the group to
make payments, subject to warranties, of €12 million to the former owners of Evros Technology Group following the acquisition by the
group on 1 March 2021. Of the €12 million liability that is subject to warranties, there was €8 million due in July 2021 and this was paid
during the period ended 31 December 2021. The remaining liability of €4 million is expected to be paid in January 2023, subject to
warranties, as set out in the Share Purchase Agreement.

In addition, there was a €10 million acquisition completion scheme for certain members of staff that was provided by the former owners
of Evros Technology Group, €8 million was paid during the period ended 31 December 2021 and the remaining €2 million was paid in the
year ended 31 December 2022.

**(e)** **Other**
The group is self insured in respect of certain personal injury and damage claims for the estimated cost of incidents which have occurred
up to 31 December 2022, based on a case by case review with actuarial assistance. The payments will be made as the cases are settled.
The group also has provisions for costs arising from certain compliance matters, consisting primarily of commercial matters, which are
being handled and defended in the ordinary course of business.

**Significant estimates and judgements**
In determining whether provisions are required with respect to pending or threatened litigation, management reviews the following: (1) the
period in which the underlying cause of the pending or threatened litigation or of the actual or possible claim or assessment occurred, (2)
the degree of probability of an unfavourable outcome, and (3) the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Upon
considering the above and other known relevant facts and circumstances, the group recognises any loss that is considered probable and that
can be measured reliably as of the balance sheet date. In addition, the group provides for other items of an uncertain timing or amount,
such as liabilities arising as a result of self-insurance and disputes with third parties, including regulatory and taxation authorities. These
provisions are recognised when the group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events and a reliable estimate of that
obligation can be made. Estimates and judgements are used in determining the level of provisioning required and the timing of payments.

For additional information see details of the contingent liabilities set out in Note 40.

**38.** **Retirement benefit liability**
(a) The group's pension commitments are funded through separately administered Superannuation Schemes and are principally of a

defined benefit nature.

The total group pension charge is split between the schemes as follows:

**Notes** **Period ended** **Year ended**

**31 Dec 2021** **31 Dec 2022**

**€m** **€m**


Defined Benefit Schemes (the principal scheme):

Finance costs - net interest cost on net pension liability 12 (10) **(4)**

**Defined Benefit Schemes** 17 **13**

**Defined Contribution Schemes** 7 7 **5**

Total 24 **18**

**Defined Benefit Schemes**
The group sponsors a defined benefit scheme for members in Ireland, the eircom Main Superannuation Scheme. In the year ended 30 June 2014, the group
established a separate, limited scope ancillary scheme, the eircom Limited early retirement pension scheme (‘Early Retirement Trust’). At 31 December
2022, the eircom Main Superannuation Fund accounts for in excess of 99% of the group's defined benefit obligations measured in accordance with IAS 19
(Revised) "Employee Benefits".

The defined benefit schemes are funded and the assets of the schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds, the eircom Main Superannuation Fund
and the Early Retirement Trust.

**Regulatory Framework**
The group operates the defined benefit plans under broadly similar regulatory frameworks. Benefits under the Schemes are paid to members from a fund
administered by Trustees, who are responsible for ensuring compliance with the Pensions Act 1990 and other relevant legislation. Plan assets are held in
trusts and are governed by local regulations and practice in each country.

**eircom Main Superannuation Scheme**
The Scheme is closed to new entrants. However, benefits continue to accrue to members in active service, and benefits in deferment and
in payment are subject to discretionary increases on the part of the group.

Retirement benefits under the Main Superannuation Scheme are calculated by reference to pensionable service and pensionable salary at
normal retirement date. Principal benefits comprise of:

(i) Retirement pension, calculated at 1/80[th] of pensionable pay for each year of reckonable service, up to a maximum of 40/80ths
(that is, half pensionable pay). Pensionable pay in most cases is made up of a member's wages or salary at the last day of service
plus certain pensionable allowances

(ii) Retirement gratuity (also known as "lump-sum"), calculated at 3/80[th] of pensionable pay for each year of reckonable service, up
to a maximum of 120/80ths (that is, one and a half times pensionable pay).

(iii) Death gratuity, for in-service members, of at least one year's pensionable pay subject to a limit of one and a half times pensionable
salary calculated in the same manner as the retirement gratuity.

On an ongoing basis, the Scheme's liabilities consist of obligations to make benefit payments to current and potential future beneficiaries.

As a result of the Pensions Accord, agreed with Trade Unions in 2010, pension increases, if any, will be capped at the lowest of the
following:

- the percentage increase in actual pay awarded;

- the percentage increases in consumer prices in the year as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) published by the CSO for the
prior year to 31 December; and

- maximum annual increase of 2.5%.

**38. Retirement benefit liability - continued**

**Early Retirement Trust**
The Early Retirement Trust was established in the year ended 30 June 2014 to provide benefits to staff exiting under the Incentivised Exit
Programme who opted to avail of an enhanced early retirement option with up to five years added service. In addition to their pre-existing
membership of the eircom Main Superannuation Scheme, those individuals became members of the Early Retirement Trust, which provides
fixed pension benefits between the last day of service and age sixty. At age sixty, benefits from the Early Retirement Trust cease and the
preserved benefits under the eircom Main Superannuation Scheme become payable. The Early Retirement Trust is closed to future accrual
of benefits.

**eircom Main Superannuation Scheme Actuarial Valuation and Funding**
The actual contribution rate in respect of the principal scheme is 8.5% of pensionable emoluments, for the period to the next valuation, as
advised by the group's actuaries. The last actuarial valuation of the principal scheme was carried out using the attained age method, as at
31 March 2022, by Mercer, who are actuaries to the Scheme but are neither officers nor employees of the group. The actuarial method used
involved determining an appropriate future group contribution rate designed to fund the projected liabilities of the Scheme related to service
subsequent to 1 January 1984 (see Note 38 (b)) over the remaining working lifetime of the current members.

The actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2022 was determined by reference to the following critical assumptions: (1) an assumed rate of
pensionable pay and pension inflation of 2.5% per annum and (2) an assumed rate of investment return of 1.49%. At the date of the last
actuarial valuation, the market value of the pension scheme assets was €4,756 million, and the actuarial valuation of the assets attributable
to the pension fund was sufficient to meet more than 100% of the value of the scheme's accrued liabilities making due allowance for future
increases in salaries and pensions.

The actuarial valuation report also indicated that the Scheme met the Minimum Funding Standard as at 31 March 2022, and included a
completed Actuarial Funding Certificate confirming this outcome. The actuarial report is available for inspection by the members of the
scheme at 2022 Bianconi Avenue, Citywest Business Campus, Dublin 24, Ireland. The actuarial report is not available for public inspection.

It is intended that the next scheduled formal valuation of the Scheme will be undertaken at 31 March 2025.

Mercer also perform all annual valuations required under IAS 19 “Employee Benefits”. These valuations are performed on the projected
unit basis.

**38. Retirement benefit liability - continued**

**Sensitivity of defined benefit obligation to key assumptions**
The table below sets out the sensitivity of defined benefit obligation to changes in key assumptions:

**Impact on actuarial liabilities**

**Change in**

**Assumption** **31 Dec 2021** **31 Dec 2022**

**€m** **€m**


Discount rate


0.25% increase


(160)


**(98)**


Rate of increase in salaries and pensions in payment 0.25% increase 165 **103**

Life expectancy 1 year increase 170 **91**

The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, a change
in one assumption could impact on other assumptions due to the relationship between assumptions.

**Risks and risk management**
Through its defined benefit pension schemes, the group is exposed to a number of areas of risk. The key areas of risk, and the ways in
which the group has sought to manage them, are set out below.

**_Property investment values_**
Property investments are valued on the basis of open market value by an independent valuer. The significant assumptions used in the
valuation are rental yields and occupancy rates. In light of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic uncertainty exists in the property values.
The Directors still consider the valuations to be the best estimate of the property portfolio, but there is a higher level of uncertainty compared
to previous years.

**_Asset volatility_**
The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; if plan assets underperform this yield,
this will create a deficit. The funds hold a certain proportion of equities, which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the longterm while providing volatility and risk in the short-term.

There is also an element of credit risk attaching to the bond portfolio and currency risk to the extent that assets are denominated in currencies
other than the euro and are not correspondingly hedged.

**_Changes in bond yields_**
From an accounting liability perspective, the schemes are also exposed to movements in corporate bond spreads. A decrease in corporate
bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the schemes' bond holdings.

**_Inflation risk_**
The majority of the plans’ benefit obligations are linked to inflation and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities, although in most
cases caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect the plans against high inflation.

**_Life expectancy_**
The majority of the schemes' obligations are to provide a pension for the life of the member and that of the member's widowed spouse,
which means that increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans’ liabilities.

**Significant estimates and judgements**
_Making appropriate long-term assumptions in calculating pension liabilities, surpluses and costs_
The group operates a funded defined benefit scheme, which is independent of the group’s finances, for certain employees. Valuations of
the main scheme are carried out by the scheme actuaries. The rates of contribution payable and the pension cost are determined on the
advice of the actuaries. The cost of these benefits and the present value of the pension liabilities depend on the assumptions made in respect
of such factors as the life expectancy of the members of the scheme, the salary progression of current employees, and the interest rate at
which the future pension payments are discounted. The group uses estimates for all of these factors in determining the pension costs,
surpluses or deficits arising on acquisitions and assets and liabilities reflected in the financial statements.

The group determines the appropriate discount rate at the end of each year. This is the interest rate that should be used to determine the
present value of estimated future cash outflows expected to be required to settle the pension obligations. In determining the appropriate
discount rate, the group considers the yields of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits
will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension obligation.

The group agreed certain caps in 2010 on future increases in pensionable salaries. The maximum increase in any given year is set at the
lower of pre-determined fixed annual rates, the rate of CPI or salary inflation. However, there is still a significant level of uncertainty in
relation to ultimate pensionable salaries that will apply in determining benefits payable. Differences between assumptions made and actual
experience and changes in assumptions made also impact on pension charges. The effect of changes in assumptions on the pension scheme
valuation is shown in the above sensitivity analyses.

**43.** **Business combinations - continued**

**Significant estimates and judgements**
_Assigning fair values to assets and liabilities acquired through business combinations_
In the purchase price allocation made for each acquisition, the purchase price is assigned to the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent
liabilities based on fair values for these assets. Any remaining excess value is reported as goodwill. This allocation requires management
judgement including estimating the fair value of the acquired intangible assets and estimating the revenue and profits to be generated by
the acquired business as well as the definition of cash generating units for impairment testing purposes. Other judgements might result in
significantly different results and financial position in the future. There was significant judgement and estimates involved in determining
the nature of the intangible assets acquired and in classifying and valuing such assets. The group determined that the “know how” acquired
was more in the nature of workforce which does not qualify to be recognised distinctly and the related value is included within goodwill
arising on acquisition. The group also needed to determine the appropriate assumptions and useful lives in connection with the customer
relationships.

**44.** **Standards, interpretations and amendments not yet adopted**
Certain new standards, interpretations and amendments have been published that are not mandatory for the group’s 31 December 2022
reporting period and have not been early adopted by the group. There are no new standards that are not yet effective and that would be
expected to have a material impact on the group in the current or future reporting periods and on foreseeable future transactions.

**45.** **Section 357 guarantees**
In accordance with Section 357 of the Companies Act 2014, the company has guaranteed the liabilities and commitments of certain of its
subsidiaries and, as a result, such subsidiaries have been exempted from the provisions of Section 357 of the Companies Act 2014.

The company has guaranteed the liabilities and commitments of the following owned subsidiary undertakings and, as a result, they will
annex the group financial statements of eircom Holdings (Ireland) Limited to their annual returns: 
eircom limited (Ireland), Meteor Mobile Communications Limited, Irish Telecommunications Investments DAC and GoFree Limited.

**46.** **Approval of financial statements**
These financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 20 March 2023.
