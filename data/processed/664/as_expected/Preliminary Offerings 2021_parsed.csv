Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are supplemental measures that are not required by or presented in accordance with GAAP. We evaluate our operating performance using a metric we refer to as Adjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted for interest, tax, depreciation and amortization as further adjusted to exclude certain items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance or that impact comparison of the performance of our businesses either period-over-period or with other businesses as more fully described below. We define Further Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA on a pro forma basis for the twelve months ended June 26, 2021, adjusted for the historical Adjusted EBITDA of acquisitions, assuming such acquisitions were made at the beginning of the earliest period presented, the estimated net favorable impact to our business from elevated demand for certain of our products due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the estimated run rate impact of signed contracts and net rent payments under the Master Lease (as defined herein) (assuming the completion of the CMBS Loan (as defined below)). We use Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA to compare our operating results on a consistent basis. We present Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA because we believe they assist investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance, and we believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA provide useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating our operating results. Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect certain cash expenses that we are obligated to make, and although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements. We define Free Cash Flow as Adjusted EBITDA less total net capital expenditures for the applicable period (capital expenditures less proceeds received on sale of fixed assets). We use Free Cash Flow to evaluate our ability to generate cash that can be used for working capital requirements, interest expense, repayment of indebtedness, member distributions, acquisitions and for continued re-investment into our business. Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are not measurements of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP. In evaluating our performance as measured by Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow, management recognizes and considers the limitations of these measures. Other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow differently than we do or may not calculate them at all, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for net income (loss), cash flow from operations or any other measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, as applicable, and should be considered together with our GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to the corresponding GAAP financial measures set forth in this offering memorandum. iv -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,482

Our expanding network of distribution centers are strategically located to ensure one-day delivery to 99% of the United States, which is a key customer purchasing criteria and supports our high customer satisfaction levels. Our over 23 million square feet of medical grade distribution centers are expertly designed to optimize logistics and maximize utilization. We rely upon and continually upgrade the technology in our distribution centers to maximize efficiency. An example of this is the AutoStore system integrated into our distribution centers, which is a space saving, automated storage and goods-to-person picking system. Our technologically advanced distribution centers allow us to continue to increase our cutoff times, expand our product offering and better service our expanding customer base. Additionally, we offer supply chain and inventory management services out of our distribution centers to further enhance customer value.

Our owned trucking fleet offers superior customer service by allowing continuity with customers until the last minute: customers are able to track shipments and ensure reliability with delivery teams that are highly ingrained with our customers, while allowing us to address specific “ship to” requirements that are outside the capabilities of common carriers, often including multiple sites within the same hospital or IDN system.

664,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.9,Competition,9.9.1,,"We are first and foremost a medical products manufacturer. Our value proposition is predicated on the value delivered to customers through the strength of our vertically integrated model, the breadth of our Medline Brand product portfolio, and the high quality and value delivered by our products. Furthermore, the majority of our profit is derived from Medline Brand products. Our key competitors are other leading medical product manufacturers and OEMs including Becton Dickinson / Bard, 3M, Stryker, Baxter and Medtronic. Similar to us, these competitors manufacture a wide range of med-surg supplies. However, unlike us, many of these competitors are reliant upon third-party distributors—oftentimes Medline’s Distributed Products division—to deliver their products to customers. By nature of being a distributor, Medline has direct access to and is the owner of the end customer relationships. We have a differentiated ability to offer a complete solution as a manufacturer and a distributor, offering our customers best-in-class supply chain logistics and driving value through our brand. 8 ----- Our second group of competitors are distributors of med-surg products including Owens & Minor, Cardinal, McKesson and Henry Schein. Similar to us, these distributors connect the fragmented supplier and provider bases and aggregate inventory from suppliers to deliver products to customers. These distribution competitors are our main source of competition for prime vendor contracts. However, many of these competitors do not benefit from our vertical integration or commercial excellence, and thus are not able to provide the same magnitude of cost savings, high value and holistic solutions that we deliver for our customers. Over the last few years, we have successfully won business from these key competitors while maintaining our industry-leading net prime vendor customer retention rates averaging over 94% for the last five years.",N/A,as_expected,2021,482
664,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.10,Our Industry,9.10.1,U.S. healthcare expenditures,"According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, U.S. healthcare expenditures were $3.8 trillion in 2019 and are expected to grow 5.4% annually to $6.2 trillion by 2028, representing 19.7% of GDP. Demographic trends continue to drive this growth, including an aging population and the high prevalence of chronic diseases and co-morbidities. Notably, adults aged 65 and older, whose population is expected to grow the fastest and represent 21% of the population by 2030 compared to 15% in 2016 according to the U.S. Census Bureau, have the highest prevalence of chronic conditions and spend approximately three times more than working adults in annual healthcare spend. Of total U.S. healthcare spend in 2019, hospital expenditures amounted to $1.2 trillion and physician and clinical services expenditures amounted to $772 billion. Spending in non-acute settings such as physician offices, surgery centers and post-acute centers has continued to increase as volumes continue to shift away from hospitals toward alternate site settings.",N/A,as_expected,2021,482
664,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.10,Our Industry,9.10.2,Medical-surgical market,"Med-surg products include a variety of essential supplies and equipment used by healthcare providers. In the United States, over 2,000 acute providers, 3,300 post-acute care providers, 195,000 physician groups and 5,700 ambulatory surgery centers utilize med-surg products to provide safe and effective care to patients across the continuum. These products are critical in nature, range in offering and complexity, and are largely single-use, disposable items which must be replenished and replaced regularly. Examples include incontinence briefs and wipes, personal protective equipment (“PPE”), including gowns, masks, headwear and footwear, IV start and dressing change kits, textiles, advanced and traditional wound care, durable medical equipment, surgical drapes and gowns, bathing systems, skin care, sterilization wraps, fluid management kits, urology trays, bladder scanners and general diagnostics. Med-surg products are primarily manufactured by a fragmented base of over 4,000 OEMs who typically sell a majority of products through distributors. In addition to aggregating inventory from fragmented suppliers and delivering products to end customer providers, select distributors, including Medline, also self-manufacture products and sell directly to healthcare providers. The vast majority of healthcare providers do not keep substantial inventory on hand, which has created an industry expectation for products to be in stock and delivered in short timeframes, such as the next day. Therefore, having scale and a robust geographic footprint with strategically located warehousing and distribution facilities is essential to effectively and efficiently serve customers. The widened global need for PPE and other medical supplies during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 further highlighted this, and Medline responded to the crisis by delivering 80% more PPE than any other single U.S. provider, solidifying our status as a critical partner to our customers and opening new customer opportunities across the continuum of care. Furthermore, the ongoing consolidation amongst healthcare providers continues to drive vendor consolidation and a bias toward larger, scaled vendors, in order to more efficiently manage procurement. 9 ----- 10 ----- Outside of the United States, the international med-surg distribution market was approximately $75 billion in 2020.",N/A,as_expected,2021,482

The summary historical consolidated balance sheet data as of June 26, 2021 and the consolidated statements of comprehensive income and consolidated statements of cash flows data for the six months ended June 27, 2020 and June 26, 2021 have been derived from the Company’s unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. The summary unaudited consolidated statement of comprehensive income data for the twelve months ended June 26, 2021 have been derived by taking the audited consolidated statement of comprehensive income data for the year ended December 31, 2020, adding the unaudited consolidated statement of comprehensive income data for the six months ended June 26, 2021, and subtracting the unaudited consolidated statement of comprehensive income data for the six months ended June 27, 2020. The unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and, in the opinion of management, include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the results for those periods. Results for the six months ended June 26, 2021 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year or any future reporting period. Our audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited historical consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum do not reflect the impact of the Transactions.

We depend on these third-party manufacturers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable prices. However, we cannot guarantee that these third-party manufacturers will be able to meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements, which could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Other risks associated with our reliance on third parties to manufacture products include reliance on the third-party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, misappropriation of the Company’s intellectual property, limited ability to manage our inventory, possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the thirdparty and the possible termination or nonrenewal of the manufacturing agreement by the third-party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us. Moreover, if any of our third-party manufacturers suffer any damage to facilities, lose benefits under material agreements, experience power outages, encounter financial difficulties, are unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers or suffer any other reduction in efficiency, or fail to comply with regulatory requirements, we may experience significant business disruption. In the event of any such disruption, the Company would need to seek and source other qualified third-party manufacturers, likely resulting in further delays and increased costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In certain cases we may not be able to establish additional or replacement suppliers for such materials or third-party manufacturers for such services in a timely or cost effective manner, largely as a result of FDA and other regulations that require, among other things, qualification and FDA approval of replacement suppliers and third-party manufacturers, and validation of materials, components and services prior to their use in or with our products. We also manufacture certain of our own products, which requires the timely delivery of a sufficient amount of quality components and materials and is highly exacting and complex, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. In addition, many of our products require sterilization before sale and several of our key products are manufactured or sterilized at a particular facility, with limited alternate facilities. If an event occurs that results in damage to or closure of or a reduction in production or sterilization at one or more of such facilities, we may be unable to manufacture or sterilize the relevant products to the required quality specifications or at all. Because of the time required to approve and license a manufacturing or sterilization facility, a third-party may not be available on a timely basis to replace production capacity in the event manufacturing or sterilization capacity is lost. We seek to maintain continuity of supply by use of multiple options for sourcing where possible. However, for reasons including quality assurance, cost effectiveness, or availability, certain components, raw materials and services needed to manufacture our products are obtained from a limited number of suppliers. Although we work closely with our suppliers to try to ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability, the supply of these components, raw materials and services may be interrupted or insufficient. 34 ----- Other disruptions in the manufacturing process or product sales and fulfillment systems for any reason, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, supplier facility shutdowns, regulatory enforcement actions, increased shipping times, defective raw materials, natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes or wildfires, property damage from riots and other environmental factors and the impact of epidemics or pandemics, such as COVID-19, and actions by businesses, communities and governments in response, could lead to launch delays, increased fulfillment times, product shortages, unanticipated costs, lost revenues and damage to our reputation.",N/A,as_expected,2021,482

Although no sales of products of any individual supplier exceeded 6.5% of our 2020 net sales, sales of products of our ten largest suppliers accounted for approximately 24.8% of 2020 net sales. A key supplier’s failure to sell and deliver us products necessary to meet our customers’ demands, including as a result of disruptions in, or an increase in the costs associated with sourcing, manufacturing and distribution of such supplier’s products, a change in purchasing and delivery terms by such supplier, import or export restrictions, obligations under the Defense Production Act or similar laws or governmental directives or the decision by such supplier to distribute its products directly to healthcare providers rather than through third-party distributors or through other distributors rather than us could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We contract with premier domestic and international carriers to help manage this risk, and we bear the cost of the majority of our freight expense. Global capacity challenges, port congestion and equipment displacement continue to create upward pressure on import costs. Accordingly, any significant increase in shipping rates and times could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Recently, we have experienced significant increases in freight expenses, which we expect, together with increased labor costs, will negatively impact our net income and Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of 2021 and may continue to negatively affect our results of operations in the future. Similarly, strikes or other service interruptions by those shippers could cause our operating expenses to rise and materially adversely affect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis.",N/A,as_expected,2021,482

Prices of these commodities are volatile and have fluctuated in recent years, which may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations. Additionally, we purchase certain of these commodities in currencies other than U.S. dollars and fluctuations in the exchange rate between those currencies and the U.S. dollar may increase our costs. We do not currently engage in any hedging activities. Prices of oil and gas also affect our distribution and transportation costs. Furthermore, due to competitive dynamics and contractual limitations, we may be unable to pass along commodity-driven cost increases through higher prices. If we cannot fully offset cost increases through other cost reductions, or recover these costs through price increases or surcharges, we could experience lower margins and profitability which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2021,482
664,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to our Business,13.1.5,We face competition and accelerating pricing pressure.,"The med-surg industry is highly competitive and characterized by pricing and margin pressure for our business. We compete with other medical product manufacturers and distributors, as well as customer self 35 ----- distribution models and, to a lesser extent, certain outsourced logistics companies. Competitive factors within the med-surg industry include market pricing, total delivered product cost, product availability, the ability to fill and invoice orders accurately, delivery time, range of services provided, efficient product sourcing, inventory management, information technology, electronic commerce capabilities and the ability to meet customer-specific requirements. Our success is dependent on the ability to compete on the above factors, while managing internal costs and expenses. These competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, in recent years, the healthcare industry in the United States has experienced and continues to experience significant consolidation in response to cost containment legislation and general market pressures to reduce costs. This consolidation of our customers and suppliers generally gives them greater bargaining power to reduce the pricing available to them, which may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2021,482
664,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to our Business,13.1.6,"If we experience decreasing prices for our goods and services and we are unable to reduce our expenses, there may be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.","We have experienced, and may continue to experience, decreasing prices for certain of our goods and services due to pricing pressure from managed care organizations and other third-party payers on our customers, increased market power of Group Purchasing Organizations (“GPOs”), IDNs, and other customers as the med-surg industry consolidates and increased competition among med-surg products and services providers. GPOs and IDNs negotiate pricing arrangements with medical product companies and distributors and then offer these negotiated prices to affiliated hospitals and other members. GPOs and IDNs typically award contracts on a category-by-category basis through a competitive bidding process. Bids are generally solicited from multiple providers with the intention of driving down pricing or reducing the number of vendors. Due to the highly competitive nature of the GPO and IDN contracting processes, we may not be able to obtain new, or maintain existing, contract positions with major GPOs and IDNs. Additionally, while having a contract with a GPO for a given product category can facilitate sales to members of that GPO, such contract positions can offer no assurance that any level of sales will be achieved, as sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders. Members of the GPO are generally free to purchase from other suppliers, and any such purchases could result in a decline in our sales volumes and revenue. Furthermore, the increasing leverage of organized buying groups may reduce market prices for our products, thereby reducing our revenue and margins. Cost reform has triggered a consolidation trend in the healthcare industry to aggregate purchasing power, which may create more requests for pricing concessions in the future. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party coverage and reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to change the healthcare industry worldwide, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among our customers, which may exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products. If the prices for our goods and services decrease and we are unable to reduce our expenses, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will be adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2021,482
664,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to our Business,13.1.7,We have concentration in and dependence on certain healthcare provider customers and GPOs.,"In 2020, our top five customers, each of which is an IDN, represented approximately 10.5% of our net sales. In addition, in 2020, approximately 61% of our net sales was from sales to member hospitals under contract with our largest GPOs: Vizient, Premier and HealthTrust Purchasing Group. We could lose a significant healthcare provider customer if an existing contract expires without being replaced or is terminated by the customer prior to its expiration. Although the termination of our relationship with a given GPO would not necessarily result in the loss of the member hospitals as customers, any such termination of a GPO relationship, or a significant individual healthcare provider customer relationship, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 36 ----- We also have contracts with government entities, which are subject to risks such as lack of funding and legal compliance. For example, government contract purchase obligations are typically subject to the availability of funding, which may be eliminated. Our government contracts might not be renewed or might be terminated for convenience with little or no prior notice, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2021,482

As the healthcare industry consolidates, competition to provide goods and services to industry participants will become more intense. Additionally, our existing customers may consolidate with industry participants that do not use our services or purchase our products, resulting in the loss of customer relationships. Further, this consolidation creates larger enterprises with greater negotiating power, which they can use to negotiate price concessions. If we must reduce our prices because of industry consolidation, or if we lose customers as a result of their consolidation with other industry participants, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2021,482

These changes include a general decline in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement levels, efforts by healthcare insurance companies to limit or reduce payments to pharmacies and providers, the basis for payments beginning to transition from a fee-for-service model to value-based payments and risk-sharing models, and the industry shifting away from traditional healthcare venues like hospitals and into clinics, physician offices and patients’ homes. We expect the U.S. healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future. Possible changes include further reduction or limitations on governmental funding at the state or federal level, efforts by healthcare insurance companies to further limit payments for products and services or changes in legislation or regulations governing healthcare services or mandated benefits. These possible changes, and the uncertainty surrounding these possible changes, may adversely affect us. 37 ----- There have also been and continue to be proposals by several international governments, regulators and third-party payers to control healthcare costs and, more generally, to reform healthcare systems. Certain of these proposals could, among other things, limit the prices we are able to charge for our products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products and could limit the acceptance and availability of our products.

Some existing laws and regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions include controls, carbon levies, cap and trade programs and/or other measures, and additional regulation of such emissions is likely. More stringent interpretation of existing laws or regulations, as well as future laws or regulations in response to concerns over climate change, could require us and/or our suppliers to take action to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. As a result, the costs and restrictions associated with sourcing, manufacturing and distributing our products could significantly increase, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our operations and those of some of our suppliers involve the use of substances subject to these requirements, including those used in manufacturing and sterilization processes. If we or our suppliers violate these requirements, facilities could be shut down and violators could be fined, criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned. Furthermore, environmental, health and safety requirements, and their enforcement, have and are likely to continue to become more stringent, resulting in increased costs and other burdens. For example, we and other medical product manufacturers use ethylene oxide (“EtO”) to sterilize certain medical products. EtO has been the subject of increasing public and regulatory scrutiny because of changes in the assessment of health risks related 40 ----- to EtO emissions. We have made substantial capital expenditures to upgrade emissions controls at certain of our facilities where we expect to continue using EtO. We are also subject to a number of pending claims alleging personal injuries and/or other potential impacts from, and seeking relief with respect to, EtO emissions and releases. See “—Legal proceedings could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition” for further information. In addition, certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property or those who have arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous and other environmentally sensitive substances for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of those substances at their properties or at other locations where those substances have been sent for treatment or disposal. This liability may be imposed regardless of fault, and in many situations may be joint and several, meaning that a liable entity may be held responsible for more than its share of the liability, potentially up to the entire liability if other responsible entities cannot be found or are unable to respond. In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances and other environmentally sensitive materials. The ultimate cost of site cleanup and timing of future cash outflows is difficult to predict, given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup and the interpretation of applicable requirements. Our cost of complying with current or future environmental, health and safety requirements, and obligations to investigate and/or remediate environmental conditions currently known or as may be identified or arise in the future and/or to address claims resulting from such conditions, may require material expenditures by us, exceed our estimates, or have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2021,482

The continued global spread of COVID-19 could adversely impact the Company’s operations, including, among other things, our manufacturing operations, supply chain, including third-party suppliers, shipping and labor costs, sales and marketing, and customer demand, including as a result of a potential downturn in the nursing home industry. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on sales of certain of our products, especially those used in elective surgeries, which have declined as a result of the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has also had an impact on shipping, supply and labor costs, especially in recent months. Any of these factors could adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company continues to monitor the situation and while we have robust business continuity plans in place across our global supply chain network to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19, these efforts may not completely prevent our business from being adversely affected and future impacts remain uncertain. The extent to which COVID-19 will impact the Company’s future operations will depend on many factors which cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the outbreak. Any resurgence in COVID-19 infections could result in the imposition of new mandates and prolonged restrictive measures implemented in order to control the spread of the disease. While it is premature to accurately predict the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and although we have not experienced a negative impact on our overall business and results of operations from the COVID-19 pandemic to date, our results for the quarter ending September 25, 2021, the year ending December 31, 2021 and future periods could ultimately be adversely impacted with potential continuing, adverse impacts thereafter.

Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture, and marketing of med-surg products. Component failures, manufacturing nonconformances, design defects, off-label use, or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information with respect to our products, if they were to occur, could result in an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, a patient. These problems could lead to recall of, or issuance of a safety alert relating to, our products, and could result in product liability claims and lawsuits, including class actions. Strong product quality is critical to the success of our goods and services. If we fall short of these standards and our products are the subject of recalls or safety alerts, our reputation could be damaged, we could lose customers and our revenue and results of operations could decline. In certain situations, we may undertake a voluntary recall of products or temporarily shut down production lines based on performance relative to our own internal safety and quality monitoring and testing data.

Litigation is inherently unpredictable and the unfavorable outcome of one or more of these legal proceedings could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, we are currently the subject of tort lawsuits alleging current or future personal injury by purported exposure to emissions and releases of EtO from our facility in Waukegan, Illinois. See “—We must comply with extensive environmental, health and safety requirements and our operations involve hazardous and other environmentally sensitive substances, which subject us to related risks that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations .” This litigation includes a putative medical monitoring class action filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois and individual suits in Illinois state court on behalf of approximately 90 claimants alleging that the Company’s emissions caused cancer and other serious ailments to nearby residents. Other defendants in many of these claims include one or two prior owners of our Waukegan facility and/or the operator of another EtO-emitting facility in the area. We deny the allegations and are vigorously defending against the claims. However, one or more adverse judgments could result in significant liability for us and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In litigation, including those described above, plaintiffs may seek various remedies, including without limitation declaratory and/or injunctive relief; compensatory or punitive damages; restitution, disgorgement, civil penalties, abatement, attorneys’ fees, costs and/or other relief. Settlement demands may seek significant monetary and other remedies, or otherwise be on terms that we do not consider reasonable under the circumstances. It is likely that we will be subject to other claims in addition to those described above by similar groups of plaintiffs in the future relating to any of our current or former facilities or activities. Any claim brought against us, regardless of its merits, could be costly to defend and could result in increases of our insurance premiums and exhaust any insurance coverage that we may have for such claims. The financial impact of such litigation is difficult to assess or quantify. Some or all claims brought against us might not be covered by our insurance policies or, if covered, might exhaust our available insurance coverage for such occurrences. Even 42 ----- where the claim should be covered by insurance, we have significant self-insured retention amounts, which we would have to pay in full before obtaining any insurance proceeds. Any decisions adverse to our position could result in our being obligated to make substantial payments. Even if such claims are decided in our favor, the costs associated with defending them could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, awards against and settlements by our competitors or publicity associated with our EtO litigation and/or EtO litigation involving our competitors could incentivize people not currently involved to bring claims against us. Additionally, some of the products that we distribute or manufacture have been and may in the future be alleged to cause personal injury, subjecting us to product liability claims. For example, we are a defendant in product liability lawsuits that allege personal injuries associated with the use of ethylene oxide to sterilize certain medical products. Product liability insurance for these types of claims is becoming more limited and may not be available to us at amounts that we historically have obtained or that we would like to obtain. It is possible that a settlement of or judgment for a product liability claim may not be covered by insurance or exceed available insurance recoveries. If this happens, and if any such settlement or judgment is in excess of any prior accruals, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. We also operate in an industry characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation. Third parties may initiate legal proceedings contending that we are infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which could be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

To varying degrees, each of these agencies requires us, and our third-party manufacturers, to comply with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of our products. As a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for new products and new indications for existing products, we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs, patient populations and trial endpoints. Unfavorable clinical data from existing or future clinical trials may adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals, our position in, and share of, the markets in which we participate, and our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain marketing clearance for our new products or enhancements or modifications to existing products, and the failure to maintain approvals or obtain approval or clearance could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Even if we are able to obtain approval or clearance, it may: - take a significant amount of time; - require the expenditure of substantial resources; 43 ----- - involve stringent clinical and pre-clinical testing, as well as increased post-market surveillance; - involve modifications, repairs or replacements of our products; and - limit the proposed uses of our products. Both before and after a product is commercially released, we have ongoing responsibilities under the U.S. FDA and other applicable non-U.S. government agency regulations. For instance, many of our facilities and procedures and those of our suppliers are also subject to periodic inspections by the U.S. FDA to determine compliance with applicable regulations. The results of these inspections can include inspectional observations on the U.S. FDA’s Form-483, warning letters, or other forms of enforcement. If the U.S. FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical products are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the U.S. FDA could ban such medical products, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical products, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such products, refuse to grant pending pre-market approval applications or require certificates of non-U.S. governments for exports, and/or require us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The U.S. FDA and other non-U.S. government agencies may also assess civil or criminal penalties against us, our officers or employees and impose operating restrictions on a company-wide basis. The U.S. FDA may also recommend prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products and limit our ability to obtain future pre-market clearances or approvals, and could result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations. In addition, an inability to address noncompliance issues raised by the U.S. FDA and other non-U.S. government agencies in an effective and timely manner may also cause negative publicity, a loss of customer confidence in us or our current or future products, which may result in the loss of sales and difficulty in successfully launching new products. Furthermore, we occasionally receive subpoenas or other requests for information from state and federal governmental agencies, and while these investigations typically relate primarily to financial arrangements with healthcare providers, regulatory compliance and product promotional practices, we cannot predict the timing, outcome or impact of any such investigations. Any adverse outcome in one or more of these investigations could include the commencement of civil and/or criminal proceedings, substantial fines, penalties, and/or administrative remedies, including exclusion from government reimbursement programs and/or entry into Corporate Integrity Agreements with governmental agencies. In addition, resolution of any of these matters could involve the imposition of additional, costly compliance obligations. These potential consequences, as well as any adverse outcome from government investigations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the U.S. FDA has taken the position that device manufacturers are prohibited from promoting their products other than for the uses and indications set forth in the approved product labeling, and any failure to comply could subject us to significant civil or criminal exposure, administrative obligations and costs, and/or other potential penalties from, and/or agreements with, the federal government. Governmental regulations outside the United States have, and may continue to, become increasingly stringent and common. In the European Union, for example, a new Medical Device Regulation which became effective in May 2021, includes significant additional pre-market and post-market requirements. Penalties for regulatory non-compliance could be severe, including fines and revocation or suspension of a company’s business license, mandatory price reductions and criminal sanctions.

Because of the predominance of government-administered healthcare systems in many jurisdictions around the world, many of our customer relationships outside of the United States are with governmental entities and are therefore potentially subject to such laws. We also participate in public-private partnerships and other commercial and policy arrangements with governments around the globe. Global enforcement of anti-corruption laws has increased in recent years, including investigations and enforcement proceedings leading to assessment of significant fines and penalties against companies and individuals. Our international operations create a risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees, consultants, sales agents, or distributors. We have implemented and maintain policies and procedures designed to educate our employees and agents on, and to prevent improper practices that could give rise to, violations of applicable anti-corruption laws. However, these policies and procedures may not always be effective, and our employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors may engage in conduct for which we could be held responsible. In addition, regulators could seek to hold us liable for conduct committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire. Any alleged or actual violations of these regulations may subject us to government scrutiny, criminal or civil sanctions and other liabilities, including exclusion from government contracting, and could materially disrupt our business, adversely affect our reputation and result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, various governmental authorities (including the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury) administer and enforce laws and regulations prohibiting persons subject to their jurisdiction from dealing with countries or territories subject to comprehensive sanctions (currently Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Syria) and with certain individuals and entities designated on sanctions lists maintained by such governmental authorities (collectively, “Sanctions Targets”). Our international operations may expose us, directly or indirectly, to Sanctions Targets. We have implemented and maintain policies and procedures designed to identify counterparties that may be Sanctions Targets and to prevent transactions that would give rise to violations of applicable sanctions laws. However, these policies and procedures may not be effective in all instances. To the extent that the Company engages in business involving Sanctions Targets or their property interests, U.S. persons investing in the Company may incur the risk of indirect exposure to such Sanctions Targets. There can be no assurance that the United States or other countries or trade blocs, including the European Union, will not impose additional sanctions or implement new sanctions programs at a later date. Any future imposition of sanctions by the United States, the European Union or any of its member states, the United Kingdom or any other relevant sanctions authority may reduce the flow of goods from certain of our suppliers or may prevent us from engaging in dealings with certain countries or jurisdictions.

The ability of our customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for products and services from third-party payers is critical because it affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. We also directly submit claims and other information to governmental healthcare programs for certain durable medical equipment, including prosthetics, orthotics and supplies (“DMEPOS” or “DME”), through our Managed Care division. As a result, our devices, products and therapies are subject to regulation regarding quality and cost by The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 45 ----- (“CMS”), as well as comparable state and non-U.S. agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health are goods and services, including laws and regulations related to kickbacks, false claims, self-referrals and healthcare fraud and abuse (e.g., the federal False Claims Act (“FCA”), Stark Law and Anti-Kickback Statute (“AKS”)). The AKS, for example, prohibits knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, whether directly or indirectly, in return for purchasing or ordering items or services, or patient referrals to providers of services, for which payment may be made in whole or in part by Medicare, Medicaid or other federally funded healthcare programs. Under the AKS, there are exceptions for, among other things, properly reported discounts, and payments of certain administrative fees to GPOs. Because of the breadth of the statutory prohibitions and the narrowness of statutory exceptions, Congress directed the Secretary of Health and Human Services to publish “safe harbor” regulations identifying certain practices that will not be treated as violating the AKS. While failure to satisfy the criteria for a safe harbor does not necessarily mean that an arrangement is unlawful, engaging in a business practice for which there is a safe harbor may be regarded as suspect if the practice fails to meet each of the prescribed criteria of the appropriate safe harbor. The enumerated safe harbors include safe harbors which implement, and further refine, the statutory exceptions for discounts and payments to GPOs. Because we sell some of our products to customers at prices below list price, we are engaged in giving discounts within the meaning of the AKS. The regulations require sellers to fully and accurately report all discounts and inform buyers of their obligations to report such discounts. We also pay administrative fees to certain purchasing agents within the meaning of the AKS. In order to qualify for the GPO safe harbor, certain requirements must be met including disclosure by the GPO to its members of the existence of the GPO fee arrangement and the requirement that members be neither wholly owned by the GPO nor subsidiaries of a parent corporation that wholly owns the GPO. Many states have similar laws related to kickbacks, false claims, self-referrals and healthcare fraud and abuse that apply to reimbursement by state Medicaid and other funded programs as well as in some cases to all payers. In certain circumstances, insurance companies attempt to bring a private cause of action against a manufacturer for causing false claims. The relationships that we, and third parties that market and/or sell our products, have with healthcare professionals, such as physicians, hospitals, healthcare organizations and others, are also subject to scrutiny under various state, federal and foreign laws. In addition, as a manufacturer of U.S. FDA-approved devices reimbursable by federal healthcare programs, we are subject to the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires us to annually report certain payments and other transfers of value we make to U.S.-licensed physicians or U.S. teaching hospitals. Similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level domestically, and an increasing number of governments worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with healthcare professionals. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us or our officers and employees to criminal and civil financial penalties, treble damages, imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs. FCA lawsuits can be initiated by the government or by individual whistleblowers who pursue qui tam actions on behalf of the government. We strive to ensure our arrangements comply with applicable fraud and abuse laws and other laws and regulations relating to reimbursement of healthcare goods and services. We cannot assure you, however, that governmental officials responsible for enforcing these laws or whistleblowers will not assert that we are in violation of them or that such statutes or regulations ultimately will be interpreted by the courts in a manner consistent with our interpretation. We are also subject to risks relating to changes in government and private medical reimbursement programs and policies, and changes in legal regulatory requirements in the United States and around the world. Implementation of further legislative or administrative reforms to these reimbursement systems, or adverse decisions relating to coverage of or reimbursement for our products by administrators of these systems, could have an impact on the acceptance of and demand for our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them. 46 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,482

Although we currently rely on trademarks and trade secret protection of our material brands (e.g., Medline, Curad and Proxima) and know-how, respectively, we may, over time, increase our investment in protecting our intellectual property, including through additional patents and registrations. Effective intellectual property protection is expensive to develop and maintain, both in terms of initial registration and ongoing renewal and maintenance requirements and the costs of defending our rights. The measures we take to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property may not be sufficient to offer us meaningful protection. There can be no guarantee that others will not infringe our trademarks or other intellectual property, independently develop similar manufacturing processes and technology, duplicate any of our manufacturing processes, technology or services, or design around our intellectual property to avoid any infringement. The steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate to prevent its infringement, misappropriation or other violation, and we may not be able to detect its occurrence. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, particularly our brands and know-how, our competitive position and our business could be harmed. Moreover, our failure to develop and properly manage new intellectual property could hurt our market position and business opportunities. Furthermore, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we offer our products and services, and the laws of certain non-U.S. countries where we do business or may do business in the future may not recognize certain intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Any changes in, or unexpected court interpretations of, intellectual property laws may compromise our ability to enforce our trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property rights. In addition, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, and such litigation could be costly, time consuming and distracting to management, regardless of whether we are successful or not, and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Further, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking their validity and enforceability that, if successful, could weaken or invalidate them. Our failure to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,482

Any claim that we have violated the intellectual property of third parties, with or without merit, and whether or not it results in litigation, is settled out of court or is determined in our favor, could be time consuming and costly to address and resolve, and could divert the time and attention of management and technical personnel from our business. Our liability insurance may not cover potential claims of this type adequately or at all. We also may have to seek third-party licenses to intellectual property, which may be unavailable, require payment of significant royalties or be available only at commercially unreasonable, unfavorable or otherwise unacceptable terms.

664,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to our Business,13.1.26,We are subject to complex and rapidly evolving data privacy and security laws and regulations and any ineffective compliance efforts with such laws and regulations may adversely impact our business.,"Our business involves the collection, use, storage, disclosure and processing of personal data or personally identifiable information (together, “PII”) of our employees, customers and other third parties as well as protected health information (“PHI”) in our capacity as a Covered Entity as defined under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and the regulations that implement both laws (collectively, “HIPAA”) and in some instances, as a Business Associate as defined under HIPAA on behalf of our customers for certain parts of our business. We are directly or indirectly subject to numerous and evolving federal, state and foreign laws and regulations relating to the collection, use, storage, retention, security, disclosure, transfer, return, destruction and processing of PII and PHI, such as HIPAA, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (“TCPA”), the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, and its UK equivalent (“UK GDPR”, collectively, “GDPR”) as well as U.S. state privacy laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) and state data breach notification laws. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CPRA”), the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act and the Colorado Privacy Act become effective on January 1, 2023, and other states may soon pass their own data privacy laws. While the current U.S. state privacy laws generally include certain exemptions for data subject to and handled in compliance with HIPAA, there is no guarantee that future laws will include similar exemptions. Laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection are continually evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations by various courts and regulators. For instance, in the United States, the CCPA, which increases the privacy protections afforded California residents, became effective January 1, 2020. The CCPA limits how we may collect, use and process personal data of California residents and mandates certain consents and notices in this regard. The CCPA establishes certain privacy rights and obligations regarding California residents and imposes potentially severe damages levied by regulators and creates a private right of action for certain data breaches. Further, in November 2020, California voters approved the CPRA, which will amend and expand the CCPA, beginning January 1, 2023. The CPRA imposes additional obligations on companies covered by the CCPA and establishes a regulatory agency dedicated solely to enforcing the CCPA and CPRA. The effects of the CCPA and CPRA (and other new state privacy laws) are potentially far-reaching, and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and incur substantial compliance-related costs and expenses, and it remains unclear how various provisions will be interpreted and enforced by the courts and regulators. Similarly, many foreign laws and regulations, including in countries in which we currently operate, govern the collection, storage, use, processing, disclosure, protection, transmission, retention and disposal of PII. For example, GDPR imposes strict requirements for controllers and processors in any country with respect to the PII of EU and UK residents, including, for example, limitations on data processing, sharing and retention, requirements of consents and notices to data subjects, rights of data subjects in their PII and strict requirements for how data may be transferred to so called “third countries,” including the United States. Ensuring compliance with GDPR is an ongoing commitment that involves substantial costs, and despite our efforts, data protection authorities or others (including individual consumers) may assert that our business practices fail to comply with its requirements. If our operations are found to violate GDPR requirements, we may incur substantial fines and other penalties, including bans on processing and transferring personal data, required changes to our business practices, and reputational harm, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business. In particular, serious breaches of GDPR can result in regulatory fines of up to 4.0% of our annual worldwide revenues or up to €20 million, whichever is higher. Such penalties are in addition to any civil litigation claims by data controllers and data subjects. Although we take reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable laws and regulations and have invested and continue to invest human and technology resources into data privacy compliance efforts, there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to regulatory or individual legal action, including fines, in the event of a 48 ----- security incident or other claim that a consumer’s privacy rights have been violated.

We cannot guarantee that our data security controls are sufficient. Security breaches of, or interruptions to, our information technology systems, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, phishing, spoofing and other attacks by hackers and similar breaches, or employee or contractor error, negligence or malfeasance, have in the past, and may in the future, create system disruptions or shutdowns, result in unauthorized access to, or disclosure, misuse, modification, or loss or destruction of, our or our customers’ (or their members’ and patients’) or employees’ data, or result in damage, disablement, or encryption of our data or our customers’ (or their members and patients’) or employees’ data. Such data may include sensitive data or information, including PHI or other PII. We utilize third-party service providers for important aspects of the collection, storage, processing and transmission of employee and customer (and their members’ and patients’) PII, PHI and other confidential and sensitive information, and therefore rely on the security procedures of such third-party service providers with respect to such data, and they face the same risks as those set forth above. We take certain administrative, physical and technological safeguards to address data security risks, such as by requiring contractors and other third-party service providers who handle PHI, other PII and other sensitive information on our behalf to enter into agreements that obligate them to use reasonable efforts to safeguard such PHI, other PII, and other sensitive information, and to comply with applicable laws regarding their collection, use, storage, processing, and transmission of such PHI and other PII. Measures taken to protect our systems, those of our contractors or third-party service providers, or the PHI, other PII, or other sensitive information we, our contractors or third-party service providers process or maintain, may not adequately protect us from security risks. We have and may in the future be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches, regardless of whether such breaches are of our systems or networks, or the systems or networks of our customers, contractors or third-party service providers. Despite our implementation of data privacy and security measures, cyberattacks are becoming harder to detect and more frequent in recent years, in part because of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, malicious state actors, and other internal and external parties. As a result, we, our customers or our third-party service providers have and may in the future be unable to anticipate the techniques used to attack our or their systems or networks, or to implement adequate protective measures. Security breaches, interruptions of systems or other security incidents that we, our customers or our thirdparty service providers experience have and could in the future harm our reputation, compel us to comply with breach notification and other laws in all 50 states, and under HIPAA, GDPR and other laws and regulations, expose us to legal and regulatory fines, penalties and other liabilities, contract and indemnity obligations, and cause us to incur significant costs for investigations and remediation, notification to affected individuals, measures intended to repair or replace systems or technology and prevent future occurrences and potential increases in insurance premiums. If we are unable to prevent or mitigate security breaches, interruptions of systems or other security incidents in the future, or to implement satisfactory remedial measures, or if it is perceived that we have been unable to do so, our operations could be disrupted, and we may suffer a loss of customers, reputation and individual and investor confidence. 49 ----- While we maintain insurance covering certain business interruptions, cybersecurity-related damages and claim expenses, we may not carry insurance or maintain coverage sufficient to compensate for all liability, or all types of liability, or cover any indemnification claims against us relating to any security incident or breach, disruption in information technology services.

Further, the restrictions in the indentures that will govern the notes and the agreements that will govern the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the CMBS Financing, respectively, will not prevent us from incurring obligations, such as trade payables, that do not constitute indebtedness as defined in such debt instruments.",N/A,as_expected,2021,482

No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has been made in connection with this offering of the secured notes, and the fair market value of the Collateral will be subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, changing economic conditions, competition and other future trends. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, the lenders under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the holders of the secured notes and the lenders under the Alternative RE Term Loan Facility, if consummated, will be entitled to be repaid in full from the proceeds of the Collateral before any payment is made in respect of any other indebtedness that is secured by a junior lien on such Collateral or that is unsecured (including, without limitation, the unsecured notes). Moreover, the lenders under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the lenders under the Alternative RE Term Loan Facility, if consummated, and the holders of any other additional indebtedness secured by a pari passu lien on the Collateral will share the proceeds of such Collateral ratably with the holders of the secured notes, thereby diluting the Collateral coverage available to holders of the secured notes. In particular, the fair market value of the Collateral may not be sufficient to repay the holders of the secured notes upon any foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding and after the repayment of indebtedness with prior security interests in the Collateral, if any. There also can be no assurance that the Collateral will be saleable, and even if saleable, the timing of its liquidation would be uncertain. Accordingly, there may not be sufficient Collateral to pay all or any of the amounts due on the secured notes. Any claim for the difference between the amount, if any, realized by holders of the secured notes from the sale of the Collateral securing the secured notes and the obligations under the secured notes and other obligations secured by a pari passu lien on Collateral will rank equally in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness (including, without limitation, the unsecured notes) and other obligations, including trade payables. In addition, as discussed further below, the holders of the secured notes would not be entitled to receive post-petition interest or applicable fees, costs, expenses, or charges to the extent the amount of the obligations due under the secured notes exceeded the value of the Collateral (after taking into account all other pari passu debt that was also secured by the Collateral, including the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and, if consummated, the Alternative RE Term Loan Facility), or any “adequate protection” on account of any undersecured portion of the secured notes. See “—In the event of a bankruptcy of the Issuer or any of the guarantors, the holders of the secured notes may be deemed to have an unsecured claim to the extent that the Issuer’s obligations in respect of the secured notes exceed the fair market value of the Collateral securing the secured notes and the related guarantees.” With respect to some of the Collateral, the security interest of the Notes Collateral Agent and its ability to foreclose will also be limited by the need to meet certain requirements, such as obtaining third-party consents and making additional filings. If the Issuer is unable to obtain these consents or make these filings, the security interests may be invalid and the holders will not be entitled to the Collateral or any recovery with respect thereto. We cannot assure you that any such required consents will be obtained on a timely basis or at all. These requirements may limit the number of potential bidders for certain Collateral in any foreclosure or other auction and may delay any sale, either of which events may have an adverse effect on the sale price of the Collateral. Therefore, the practical value of realizing on the Collateral may, without the appropriate consents and filings, be limited. 63 ----- Under the terms of the indenture that will govern the secured notes, the Issuer will be permitted to incur indebtedness in amounts in excess of the current commitments under New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and, if consummated, the Alternative RE Term Loan Facility.

The indentures that will govern the notes will also permit the Issuer and the guarantors to create additional liens on the Collateral under specified circumstances, some of which liens may be pari passu with or senior to the liens securing the secured notes. Any obligations secured by such liens may further dilute the collateral coverage and limit the recovery from the realization of the collateral available to satisfy holders of the secured notes.

Under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, any actions that may be taken with respect to such Collateral, including the ability to cause the commencement of enforcement proceedings against such Collateral and to control such proceedings, will be at the exclusive direction of the collateral agent under New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and, if consummated, the Alternative RE Term Loan Facility until the earlier of (1) the date on which the Issuer’s obligations under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and, if consummated, the Alternative RE Term Loan Facility are discharged (which discharge does not include certain refinancings of the senior secured credit facilities) or (2) 120 days after the occurrence of an event of default under the indenture that will govern the secured notes and acceleration of the obligations thereunder, if the secured notes represent the largest outstanding principal amount of indebtedness secured by a pari passu lien on the Collateral (other than the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and, if consummated, the Alternative RE Term Loan Facility) and the Notes Collateral Agent has complied with the applicable notice provisions so long as the agent under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and, if consummated, the Alternative RE Term Loan Facility has not commenced and is not then diligently pursuing the exercise of remedies with respect to Collateral or any portion thereof or the Issuer or any guarantor is not then a debtor in any bankruptcy or similar insolvency or liquidation proceeding. After the discharge of the obligations with respect to the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and, if consummated, the Alternative RE Term Loan Facility, the right to direct the actions with respect to the Collateral securing the secured notes will pass to the authorized representative of holders of the then largest outstanding principal amount of indebtedness secured by a first lien on the Collateral. If the Issuer issues additional indebtedness that is equal in priority to the lien securing the Issuer’s secured notes in the future in a greater principal amount than the secured notes, then the authorized representative for such additional indebtedness would be next in line to exercise rights under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, rather than the Notes Collateral Agent. Accordingly, the Notes Collateral Agent may never have the right to control remedies and take other actions with respect to the Collateral. In addition, under the terms of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, if at any time the controlling collateral agent forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any Collateral resulting in a sale thereof, the lien securing the secured notes on such Collateral will be automatically released and discharged (provided that any proceeds from such sale are applied ratably among all the then outstanding pari passu obligations). The Collateral so released will no longer secure the Issuer’s and the guarantors’ obligations under the secured notes and the related guarantees. The Holders of the secured notes will also waive certain important rights otherwise available to secured creditors in a bankruptcy, as the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement will prohibit the trustee 64 ----- for the secured notes and the Notes Collateral Agent from objecting following the filing of a bankruptcy petition to a proposed debtor-in-possession financing to be provided to us that is secured by the Collateral or to the use of cash collateral that has not been opposed to or objected to by the controlling collateral agent or the other controlling secured parties, subject to certain conditions and limited exceptions. After such a filing, the value of the Collateral could materially deteriorate, and holders of the secured notes would be unable to raise an objection. Also, under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, in the event that the holders of the secured notes obtain possession of any Collateral or realize any proceeds or payment in respect of any such Collateral at any time prior to the discharge of each of the other pari passu obligations, then such holders will be obligated to hold such Collateral, proceeds, or payment in trust for the other holders of pari passu obligations and, subject to the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, promptly transfer such Collateral, proceeds, or payment, as the case may be, to the controlling collateral agent, to be distributed in accordance with the provisions of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement among all the holders of pari passu obligations. Thus, there can be no assurances that under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, the holders of the secured notes would not be obligated to turn over to the other holders of the pari passu obligations any Collateral, proceeds or payments they may receive.

The liens on 65 ----- the Collateral securing the secured notes may not be perfected if we are not able to take the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens on or prior to the date of the issuance of the secured notes or thereafter. We will have limited obligations to perfect the security interest of the holders of the secured notes in specified collateral other than the filing of financing statements. To the extent a security interest in certain Collateral is not properly perfected on the date of the issuance of the secured notes, such security interest might be avoidable in bankruptcy, which could impact the value of the Collateral. See “—Any future pledge of Collateral or guarantee may be avoidable in bankruptcy.” If additional material wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries are formed or acquired and become guarantors under the indentures that will govern notes, additional financing statements would be required to be filed to perfect the security interest for the secured notes in the assets of such guarantors. Depending on the type of the assets constituting after-acquired collateral, additional action may be required to perfect the security interest in such assets. Applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest can be perfected only at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. Neither the trustee for the secured notes nor the Notes Collateral Agent will be responsible to monitor, and there can be no assurance that the Issuer will inform the trustee for the secured notes or the Notes Collateral Agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute Collateral, and that the necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired collateral. None of the trustee for the secured notes, the Notes Collateral Agent, the collateral agent for the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the collateral agent for the Alternative RE Term Loan Facility, if consummated, will have any obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute Collateral or monitor the perfection of or make any filings to perfect or maintain the perfection of any security interests in any of the Collateral. Such inaction may result in the loss of the security interest in such Collateral or the priority of the security interest in favor of the secured notes and the guarantees against third parties.

While the relevant laws may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the incurrence of the obligations in respect of the notes and the guarantees and, in the case of the secured notes and the related guarantees, the grant of liens will generally be a fraudulent conveyance if (i) the transactions relating to the issuance of the notes or guarantees or, in the case of the secured notes and the related guarantees, the grant of liens were undertaken with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding other creditors or (ii) the Issuer or any of the guarantors, as applicable, received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for issuing either the notes or a guarantee or, in the case of the secured notes and the related guarantees, the granting of liens and, in the case of (ii) only, any one of the following is also true: - the Issuer or any of the guarantors was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of issuing the notes or the guarantees (or the related security interests with respect to the secured notes and the related guarantees); - the issuance of the notes or guarantees (or the related security interests with respect to the secured notes and the related guarantees) left the Issuer or any of the guarantors with an unreasonably small amount of capital to carry on the business in which such Issuer or such guarantor was engaged or about to engage; or - the Issuer or any of the guarantors intended to, or believed that we or it would, incur debts beyond our or its ability to pay as they become due. If a court were to find that the issuance of the notes or a guarantee or, in the case of the secured notes and the related guarantees, the grant of liens was a fraudulent conveyance, the court could void the payment obligations under the notes or such guarantee or further subordinate the notes or such guarantee to presently existing and future indebtedness of such Issuer or such guarantor, or require the holders of the notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the notes or such guarantee or, in the case of the secured notes and the related guarantees, void the granting of liens to secure the secured notes or the related guarantees. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent conveyance occurred, you may not receive any repayment on the notes. Further, the voidance of the notes could result in an event of default with respect to our other debt and that of the guarantors that could result in acceleration of such debt. The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent conveyance laws vary depending upon the law of the jurisdiction that is being applied, such that we cannot be certain as to: the standards a court would use to 67 ----- determine whether or not the Issuer or the guarantors were solvent at the relevant time, or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, that it would not determine that the Issuer or a guarantor was indeed insolvent on that date; that any payments to the holders of the notes (including under the guarantees) did not constitute preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds; or that the issuance of the notes and the guarantees would not be subordinated to the Issuer’s or any guarantor’s other debt. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness: - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all its assets; - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its debts as they become due. As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is satisfied. A court would likely find that the Issuer or a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the notes or such guarantee and/or lien if such Issuer or such guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the notes or the applicable guarantee and/or lien. Thus, if the guarantees were legally challenged, any guarantee could be subject to the claim that, since the guarantee was incurred for the Issuer’s benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit of the guarantor, the obligations of the applicable guarantor were incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration. Therefore, a court could void the obligations under the guarantees (and any related liens in the case of the secured notes), subordinate them to the applicable guarantor’s other debt or take other action detrimental to the holders of the notes. To the extent a court avoids any of the guarantees as fraudulent transfers or holds any of the guarantees unenforceable for any other reason, (x) the holders of notes would cease to have any direct claim against the applicable guarantor or (y) in the case of liens granted to secure the secured notes or the related guarantees, the holders of secured notes would cease to have a secured claim against the Issuer or the guarantors, as applicable. If a court were to take this action, the applicable guarantor’s assets would be applied first to satisfy the applicable guarantor’s other liabilities, if any, and might not be applied to the payment of the guarantee. Sufficient funds to repay the notes may not be available from other sources, including the remaining guarantors, if any. In addition, the court might direct you to repay any amounts that you already received from the Issuer or the applicable guarantor. Although each guarantee entered into in connection with the notes will contain a provision intended to limit that guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer, this provision may not be effective as a legal matter to protect those guarantees from being avoided under fraudulent transfer law or otherwise, or may reduce that guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its guarantee worthless. In addition, as noted above, any payment by the Issuer pursuant to the notes or by a guarantor under a guarantee made at a time such Issuer or such guarantor was found to be insolvent could be voided and required to be returned to the Issuer or such guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Issuer’s or such guarantor’s creditors if such payment is made to an insider within a one-year period prior to a bankruptcy filing or within 90 days for any outside party and such payment would give such insider or outsider party more than such creditors would have received in a distribution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case. Finally, as a court of equity, the bankruptcy court may otherwise subordinate the claims in respect of the notes or the guarantees to other claims against the Issuer or the guarantors under the principle of equitable subordination, if the court determines that: (i) the holder of the notes engaged in some type of inequitable 68 ----- conduct; (ii) such inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holder of the notes; and (iii) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.",N/A,as_expected,2021,482

Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor, such as the Notes Collateral Agent, is prohibited from foreclosing upon or repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security previously repossessed from a debtor, without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances). Moreover, bankruptcy law permits the debtor to continue to retain and use collateral, and the proceeds, products, rents or profits of the collateral, even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection.” The meaning of the term “adequate protection” may vary according to the circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the value of the secured creditor’s interest in its collateral and may include cash payments or the granting of additional or replacement security, if and at such time as the court in its discretion determines, for any diminution in the value of the collateral as a result of the automatic stay of repossession or disposition or any use of the collateral by the debtor during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. A bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor may not require compensation for a diminution in the value of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the debt it secures. In view of both the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection” under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and the broad discretionary powers of a bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict how, whether or when payments under the secured notes could be made following the commencement of a bankruptcy case, the length of the delay in making any such payments or whether any such payment will be made at all or in what form, whether or when the Notes Collateral 69 ----- Agent could or would repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value of the Collateral as of the commencement date of any bankruptcy proceedings, or whether or to what extent or in what form holders of the secured notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of the value of the Collateral through the requirements of “adequate protection.”",N/A,as_expected,2021,482

Based upon the assumed balances of the New Term Loan Facilities, the CMBS Loan and the notes offered hereby, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $170.9 million and $84.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the six months ended June 26, 2021, respectively. The pro forma financial information assumes that we will consummate the CMBS Loan concurrently with the consummation of the Acquisition. If we do not consummate the CMBS Loan, we will instead borrow up to $2,230 million in lieu thereof under the Alternative RE Term Loan Facility. If we enter into the Alternative RE Term Loan Facility, it may impact our debt balance, total interest expense and amortization. (c) Represents adjustments based on preliminary estimates of fair value and the adjustment to goodwill, inventory, property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets derived from the difference in the estimated total consideration and the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Upon completion of the fair value assessment after the Acquisition, it is anticipated that the ultimate purchase price allocation will differ from the preliminary assessment outlined below. Any changes to the initial estimates of the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities will be recorded as adjustments to those assets and liabilities, and residual amounts will be allocated to goodwill. The estimated consideration is based on the cash paid and rollover equity. Final consideration will be determined at the closing of the Transactions. 88 ----- The fair value assigned to the inventory, property, plant, and equipment, and intangible assets has been estimated based on third-party preliminary valuation studies utilizing valuation techniques including the income, cost and market approaches. Working capital amounts are assumed to have fair values equal to historical book values. The final purchase price allocation will be based on an appraisal subsequent to the consummation of the Acquisition and may result in materially different allocations for assets than those presented in this unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet. Any change in the amount of the final purchase price allocated to amortizable, finite-lived intangible assets as well as inventory and property, plant and equipment could materially affect the amount of amortization and depreciation expense.

(f) Represents an estimated accrual of remaining payments to participants in the Medline Industries, Inc. Managing Partner Program, who will have an option to receive cash payments under the program in respect of their outstanding managing partner units in connection with and following the closing of the Acquisition. The total estimated payment approximates $1.8 billion and will be made in three equal installments, with the first installment paid in connection with the closing of the Acquisition and the second and third installments expected to be paid approximately 12 and 24 months, respectively, following the closing of the Acquisition. Half of the second and third payments will be made only to participants who remain employed by the Company. As such, the liability accrued only reflects the half of the second and third installments that are due to participants and not contingent on employment. Amounts accrued are an estimate and may not represent actual future payments as all participants will have the opportunity to rollover a portion of their payment into equity upon consummation of the Transactions. 89 ----- (g) Represents incremental deferred tax liabilities recognized on the preliminary estimates of fair value and the adjustments to intangible assets and inventory. These purchase accounting adjustments create new differences between the book basis and tax basis of the respective assets. The amount of these balance sheet adjustments is determined by applying the effective tax rate to the portion of these adjustments that relate to our foreign subsidiaries. For U.S. subsidiaries treated as pass-through entities for federal income tax purposes, no adjustment is necessary as the stepped-up basis in tangible and intangible assets, including Goodwill, will only be tax deductible at the investor level. Certain U.S. state jurisdictions may tax pass-through entities; however, the impact of those jurisdictions is expected to be immaterial. In conjunction with the recognition of these deferred tax liabilities, there is no net income tax provision or benefit to record on the adjustments for cost of goods sold or amortization as the items are temporary in nature.

With respect to the financing transactions, the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information is based on the assumption that we will enter into the following financing transactions: - incur $6,000 million of principal amount of term loans under the New Dollar Term Loan Facility, incur the euro-equivalent of $1,000 million of principal amount of term loans under the New Euro Term Loan Facility and enter into a $1,000 million New Revolving Credit Facility; - incur $2,230 million in principal amount in one or more mortgage and mezzanine loans under the CMBS Loan; and - issue $3,770 million aggregate principal amount of secured notes and $4,000 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes, each offered hereby. The unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet as of June 26, 2021 reflects the Transactions as if each occurred on June 26, 2021. The unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of operations reflect the Transactions as if each occurred on January 1, 2020. The unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of operations data for the twelve months ended June 26, 2021 has been derived by taking the unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of operations data for the year ended December 31, 2020, adding the unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of operations data for the six months ended June 26, 2021 and subtracting the unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of operations data for the six months ended June 27, 2020. The adjustments necessary to fairly present the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information have been made based on available information and in the opinion of management are reasonable. Assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments are described in the accompanying notes, which should be read in conjunction with this unaudited pro forma financial information. The pro forma adjustments related to the Transactions are preliminary and revisions to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed may have a significant impact on the pro forma adjustments. A final valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed has not been completed, and the completion of fair value determinations may result in changes in the values assigned to property and equipment and other assets (including intangibles) acquired and liabilities assumed. Revisions to the preliminary estimates set forth herein may have a significant impact on the pro forma amounts of total assets, total liabilities and equity, revenues, depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense and income tax expense. The actual adjustments will be made as of the closing date of the Acquisition and may differ from those reflected in the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information presented below. Such differences may be material. The unaudited pro forma financial information does not reflect any cost savings or synergies or associated costs to achieve such savings or synergies or other restructurings that may result from the Transactions. The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information is for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what our financial position or results of operations actually would have been had the events noted above in fact occurred on the assumed dates or to project our financial position or results of operations for any future date or future period. 81 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,482
664,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.1,Overview,17.1.1,Products,"Since our founding as a med-surg product manufacturer, Medline has focused intently on offering an expanding set of high quality, value priced products to support the critical needs of our customers. Over time, we have recognized the fragmented supply chain in the healthcare industry, and our customers have valued the proposition of a fully integrated distribution model. Our customers look to us as a partner who can provide value through our self-manufactured product portfolio combined with a best-in-class supply chain. Today, 55% of our revenues are from our own Medline Brand products, and 45% are from Distributed Products or third-party products sold through our own distribution network. Our combination of products and services makes us uniquely able to address our customers’ evolving needs. We operate 27 Medline Brand product divisions that manufacture over 180,000 Medline Brand products. We self-manufacture over 77,000 Medline Brand products, which are produced across over 20 owned and operated manufacturing sites throughout North America. We rely upon our deep-rooted global sourcing relationships to manufacture the remaining portion of Medline Brand products. With more than 160 exclusivity agreements, our relationships with these global contract manufacturers are long-dated, some of which have existed for over 30 years. Our robust Medline Brand product portfolio drives significant value to our customers by offering 5% to 8% cost savings relative to competitors. Medline Brand products hold market-leading positions across many key categories in the healthcare market, enabling consistent conversion rates due to high quality, product performance and customer confidence. In addition to our Medline Brand products, we sell and distribute over 150,000 third-party products from key manufacturing brands such as Becton Dickinson / Bard, 3M, Stryker, Baxter, Medtronic and Johnson & Johnson. In total, across our Medline Brand products and our Distributed Products, we offer customers over 340,000 total products across over 300 product categories. We are highly diversified across all product divisions and categories, with little concentration. The largest Medline Brand product categories include Sterile Procedure Trays, Exam Gloves and Personal Care, which accounted for $1.3 billion, $1.1 billion and $0.7 billion of revenue in 2020, respectively. Medline Brand products yield significantly higher profitability and can generate over 4x higher margins than Distributed Products. In total, Medline Brand products represented 84% of our total gross profit in 2020 versus Distributed Products representing 16%. While Distributed Products are less profitable for us, by offering our customers a complete assortment of med-surg products, we are able to solidify our customer relationships which increases satisfaction and stickiness, and creates the foundation for additional Medline Brand product sales over time. We have a rich culture of entrepreneurship and innovation that drives continued new product development. We ingrain ourselves with our customers and are uniquely positioned in the market as both a manufacturer and distributor, allowing us to identify customer needs and develop products and solutions to address those needs. This position in the market enables us to identify opportunities to provide our clients with value-added product innovations and lower cost solutions through our Medline Brand products. We benefit from a highly synergistic relationship between our sales force and product divisions. With a high number of touch points and frequent dialogue with customers, our sales force is able to identify customer needs and collaborates with our product divisions to develop solutions to address those needs. In turn, our product divisions rely upon our sales force’s access to every corner of healthcare, enabling broad applicability for their products. Coupled together, we have a differentiated ability to bring new products to market to continue to drive business opportunities, as evidenced by over 200 FDA 510K clearances, 20 of which were granted in 2020. We have also received over 1,200 granted patents with over 600 pending applications. Further, we are able to utilize our highly attractive platform capable of realizing significant synergies to acquire complementary assets that may be less efficient to develop in-house. Evidence of this is our recent acquisition of a significant portion of the Hudson RCI brand of respiratory products from Teleflex, which added 92 ----- the brand’s oxygen and aerosol therapy, active humidification and pulmonary hygiene products to complement our existing respiratory portfolio in order to meet the market needs by bolstering our respiratory product portfolio and increasing domestic and international channel access. We believe this acquisition is exemplary of our ability to recognize opportunities and our culture of quickly adapting to ultimately better serve our customers and the healthcare system.",N/A,as_expected,2021,482
664,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.1,Overview,17.1.2,Prime Vendor Relationships,"Our most important growth driver has been our ability to win prime vendor contracts with the Acute Care end-market, including hospitals and IDNs. A hospital typically awards a single prime vendor contract to one distributor. The contract is a long-term agreement between the customer and distributor for the distributor to provide the vast majority—often 100%—of the customer’s med-surg product needs. This provides essential simplicity and greater cost savings to the Acute Care hospital by centralizing all purchases with a single partner, and provides us with better customer coordination and increased visibility into customer purchasing behavior across our own and third-party brands that we sell, creating opportunities for partnership and growth. As healthcare systems continue to consolidate, IDNs now own and control many sites of care beyond the acute care setting. These IDNs are increasingly seeking a supply chain partner with reliable manufacturing and distribution capabilities who can serve the entire continuum of care. We have a differentiated ability to contract with customers for their needs across the entire continuum, including the acute care setting along with the alternate sites of care such as physician offices, ambulatory surgery centers, home health, hospice and others. Evidence of our differentiated value is our average of over 60% win rate on requests for proposal since 2018. As the only prime vendor partner with the full capability to serve the entire continuum of care, we are highly differentiated and well positioned to continue to win new business. Importantly, we expect this trend of IDN consolidation to continue, providing a growth opportunity moving forward. As of December 31, 2020, we had over 850 active prime vendor relationships, generating approximately 52% ($9.2 billion) of our 2020 revenue. Additionally, expansion of new prime vendor deals and growth in existing prime vendor contracts has been a key driver of our continued revenue growth through the third quarter of 2021. With these prime vendor contracts, we distribute both products from other product manufacturers / original equipment managers (“OEMs”) and our own Medline Brand products. At the beginning of a new prime vendor relationship, Distributed Products typically represent approximately 90% of sales. Once these contracts are signed, the strength of our vertically integrated model and the quality and pricing of our Medline Brand products encourages customers to increasingly convert from Distributed Products to Medline Brand products. Our compelling value proposition offers customers 5% to 8% of cost savings when they convert to Medline Brand Products, while also providing us with better economics and profitability on our revenue. Over time, our contracts become more profitable as customers continue to convert from Distributed Products to Medline Brand. In the first year of a prime vendor contract, we have historically been able to shift product mix to Medline Brand by approximately an incremental 10% to achieve approximately 20% Medline Brand mix. In the years thereafter, customers have historically continued to convert to Medline Brand products and increase product mix on average 2% to 3% each year through additional customer service and product innovation efforts. Our customers are also incentivized to increase their Medline Brand portfolio penetration, which, in turn, allows them to decrease their cost of distribution on Distributed Products manufactured by other suppliers. After five years, our typical experience is that Medline Brand represents approximately over 35% of a contract, and a mature run-rate contract can be 45% to over 50% Medline Brand. As customers become more price sensitive and they are increasingly able to realize the value and quality delivered by Medline Brand products, we expect this Medline Brand product mix will accelerate and increase above 35% in less than five years. 93 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,482

We have further described the impact of COVID-19 under “Risk Factors” elsewhere in this offering memorandum. We continue to work to protect our employees, while maintaining business continuity. We have taken steps to help employees lead safe and productive lives during the pandemic, including remote working, enhanced cleaning and medical screening measures, and pandemic leave policies, while maintaining strong productivity. Additional measures have been implemented to ensure the safety and protection of people who work in our plants and distribution centers across the world, many of whom support the manufacturing and delivery of products that are critical in response to the global pandemic. Certain effects of the pandemic have increased the demand for our products, while others have decreased demand or made it more difficult for us to serve customers. Serving our customers is our highest priority and our teams continue to communicate with individual customers about potential disruptions. Given the diversity of our businesses, the impact of COVID-19 varied across the Company throughout 2020 and continuing through the first six months of 2021. We experienced strong sales growth in PPE divisions, 94 ----- including Diagnostics, Proxima, Lab, Respiratory, Exam Gloves, Textiles, Preventive Care and Ready Care. At the same time, a delay in elective surgeries contributed in part to sales declines in a number of our businesses with the biggest 2020 year-on-year total sales decreases coming from our Sterile Procedure Trays (SPT) division (down 5.8%). For the full year 2020, we estimate that the total impact of COVID-19 on net sales and net income was an increase of $1,210.0 million and $405.0 million, respectively, as compared to 2019. For the six months ended June 26, 2021, we estimate that the total impact of COVID-19 on net sales and net income was an increase of $813.0 million and $95.0 million, respectively, as compared to the six months ended June 27, 2020. Although we believe the impact of the pandemic had a positive effect on sales volumes of certain of our product lines, COVID-19 has impacted our supply chains with respect to products such as Exam Gloves and other PPE products which has affected our ability to keep up with global demand for such products. As this situation continues, we closely monitor and evaluate the potential impact that supply chain constraints might have on the Company’s broader products. We are unable to predict the duration of the pandemic and the full impact that COVID-19 will have on our future financial position and operating results due to numerous variables and continued uncertainties. Although we have experienced growth in sales volumes for certain of our products (such as PPE) during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as improved productivity and manufacturing output, there can be no assurance that such growth rates, increased sales volumes or other improvements will be maintained during or following the COVID-19 pandemic.

The requirements of this rule give consumers the tools needed to access pricing information through their health plans and build upon previous actions taken to increase price transparency. The intention of the new rule is to bring greater competition to the private healthcare industry, consistent with the previously enacted governmental requirements for hospitals to disclose their standard charges, including negotiated rates with third-party payers. Our suite of service offerings that help healthcare providers address logistical and care delivery challenges may benefit from the implementation and enforcement of this new rule.

Imports of medical goods from China were affected, which had a significant impact both in terms of making some competitors’ products more expensive, and causing some of our Medline Brand products, which are contract manufactured in China, more costly to provide. In March 2020, the additional tariffs were temporarily suspended on a range of medical goods, primarily PPE, reversing the cost burden from the tariffs. In March 2021, the Biden Administration extended the tariff exclusion through September 30, 2021, to aid the continued effort to fight COVID-19. We cannot predict the duration of these suspensions, whether previous or new tariffs will be instituted or the nature of such tariffs; however, we will continue to monitor developments that will impact our business and seek to adjust our operations accordingly.

Technology developments in the logistics and marketing fields along with growing regulatory pressure, have led to a large number of mergers and acquisitions among both providers of medical care and the companies which provide the goods that support healthcare delivery. The complexity and breadth of healthcare logistics make it increasingly difficult for providers of care to handle procurement, manage inventory and forecast inventory flow. We have acquired companies both to extend our product line and to expand our share of market in strategic sectors. Recent significant acquisitions include: - _Hudson RCI Respiratory Products. On June 28, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of the Hudson RCI Respiratory business from Teleflex Inc. for $274.0 million. Medline added the brand’s oxygen and aerosol therapy, active humidification and pulmonary hygiene products to complement Medline’s existing respiratory portfolio in order to meet the needs of the market. The addition of the Hudson RCI products increases Medline’s respiratory portfolio as we are committed to offering respiratory products to meet healthcare needs in the acute and post-acute care spaces across the United States, Europe and Asia Pacific region. - _NAMIC Fluid Management Product Line. On May 31, 2019, the Company purchased the fluid management business (“NAMIC”) of Angiodynamics, Inc. for $167.5 million. NAMIC fluid management is known for its high quality and has been a natural fit with our world class portfolio of medical devices and supplies, allowing the Company to offer customers expanded choice and costeffective kitting options.

The products we provide our customers must meet rigorous quality standards; failure to meet these standards can result in recalls, sanctions, litigation and declining sales. 96 ----- We believe that we maintain industry-leading quality in our production processes and demand the same from our suppliers. As we seek to continue to replace outside-sourced products with Medline Brand products, we will face more demands to respond to regulatory requirements. In 2017, the European Community enacted a new quality standard for medical devices marketed in Europe called the Medical Device Regulation (“MDR”). The MDR went into force in May of 2021. This regulation takes the existing Medical Device Directive (“MDD”) standard and adds life cycle management of the sales of the device beyond the initial approval of the device with the prior MDD, and expands the categories of objects subject to its oversight. With international markets a major focus for our future growth and Europe a particularly valuable market with its comparatively wealthy, aging population, this new regulation has had and will continue to have a significant impact on how we conduct operations both in Europe and in our production facilities which supply our European market units. In China, the National Medical Products Administration has become more active in regulating products that are given access to the Chinese market.

The National Institute of Health projects that the population over age 85 will have doubled from 2005 by 2030 to more than 9 million. This “graying” trend is not exclusive to the United States but is shared among all of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development members. The elderly consume a disproportionate share of healthcare and are the primary users of long-term care facilities. Assuming nursing home populations increase as the world rebounds from COVID-19 and regular healthcare visits resume to pre-COVID-19 levels, we believe that demand for our post-acute products and services should similarly increase. Since we operate throughout North America, Europe and East Asia, we may benefit from the worldwide nature of this trend. Integrated delivery networks (“IDNs”) were conceived in order to provide the full continuum of healthcare services to patients from hospitals, to nursing homes, to physicians’ offices. The growth of IDNs is a firmly established trend, but this trend may intensify over the coming decade as there may be greater demand for their services, resulting from the world-wide “graying” discussed above. The objective of an IDN is to provide holistic and coordinated treatment to patients. Due to the size of IDNs, they have purchasing power and the ability to negotiate contracts with medical supply distributors, which may result in lower prices for our products. However, healthcare delivery consolidation in IDNs also will provide us the opportunity to become the prime vendor of healthcare products to larger healthcare providing organizations as existing customers acquire non-customers. Additionally, IDNs are acquiring in different end-markets, driving patient care from hospitals to these end-markets. As healthcare offerings become broader, more differentiated and patient-centric across the care continuum, clinicians and clinical staff tend to require products closely adapted to their needs, their patients’ needs, as well as their own, modus operandi preferred methods. Manufacturers and distributors who are able to engage these clinical staff members to provide adapted solutions based on their preferences and usage feedback will be in a stronger growth position. This is particularly the case in the operating room with the broad usage of custom, sterile procedure kits and trays, as determined by surgical and clinical requirements. This trend is also occurring outside the operating room where differentiated products, either custom products or products designed with clinical staff, have proliferated. Medline has developed relationships with IDNs as part of its product innovation and continuous improvement processes and is ideally positioned to leverage its product leadership and customer intimacy position. 97 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,482

This includes the use of price negotiators to lower costs across the supply chain. Group Purchasing Organizations (a “GPO” or “GPOs”) and IDNs are two of these negotiators. The goal of IDNs and GPOs is to lower costs for healthcare facilities and providers by working with suppliers to lower prices. To maximize market share and increase their leverage, IDNs and GPOs have been consolidating in recent years. We believe GPOs have and will continue to impact our operating model. GPOs help to reduce the cost of medical supplies for healthcare providers by offering buying power. Today, approximately 75% of our sales go through GPOs in the United States. Our customers gain purchasing power and steady pricing by being part of a GPO, and we pay fees to the GPOs when its members utilize the contracts to purchase our products.

Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products.

We limit our warranty to the replacement of defective parts, or a refund or credit of the price of the defective product. We do not account for these warranties as separate performance obligations. Warranty claims are not material as a majority of our products are consumables. Although products are generally sold at fixed prices, certain customers receive incentive awards, such as sales rebates, return allowances, scrap allowances, and other rights, which are accounted for as variable consideration. We estimate these amounts in the same period revenue is recognized based on the expected value to be provided to the customer and reduces revenue accordingly. Our estimate of variable consideration and ultimate determination of the estimated amounts to include in the transaction price is based primarily on its assessments of anticipated performance and historical information that is reasonably available to us. Shipping and handling costs are treated as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of sales.

In 1968, we opened our first manufacturing facility. In 1997, Charles N. Mills, Andrew J. Mills and James D. Abrams, our current CEO, President and COO, respectively, took over to lead the Company and continue its legacy of family management. Since inception, we have experienced over 50 consecutive years of revenue growth, with a 20% compounded annual growth rate since inception and continuous double digit growth for all but three years. Our growth has been primarily driven by market share gains across the continuum of care and within product categories. In 2020, we generated over $17.5 billion of revenue as the nation’s largest manufacturer and distributor of med-surg products. On June 5, 2021, Medline entered into a new chapter of our Company’s history and announced that we will receive a majority investment from a partnership comprised of funds managed by Blackstone, Carlyle and Hellman & Friedman.

Over time, we have recognized the fragmented supply chain in the healthcare industry, and our customers have valued the proposition of a fully integrated distribution model. Our customers look to us as a partner who can provide value through our self-manufactured product portfolio combined with a best-in-class supply chain. Today, 55% of our revenues are from our own Medline Brand products, and 45% are from Distributed Products or third-party products sold through our own distribution network. Our combination of products and services makes us uniquely able to address our customers’ evolving needs. We operate 27 Medline Brand product divisions that manufacture over 180,000 Medline Brand products. We self-manufacture over 77,000 Medline Brand products, which are produced across over 20 owned and operated manufacturing sites throughout North America. We rely upon our deep-rooted global sourcing relationships to manufacture the remaining portion of Medline Brand products. With more than 160 exclusivity agreements, our relationships with these global contract manufacturers are long-dated, some of which have existed for over 30 years. Our robust Medline Brand product portfolio drives significant value to our customers by offering 5% to 115 ----- 8% cost savings relative to competitors. Medline Brand products hold market-leading positions across many key categories in the healthcare market, enabling consistent conversion rates due to high quality, product performance and customer confidence. The following chart shows our leadership positions in these key product categories, based on sales volume in 2020: In addition to our Medline Brand products, we sell and distribute over 150,000 third-party products from key manufacturing brands such as Becton Dickinson / Bard, 3M, Stryker, Baxter, Medtronic and Johnson & Johnson. In total, across our Medline Brand products and our Distributed Products, we offer customers over 340,000 total products across over 300 product categories. We are highly diversified across all product divisions and categories, with little concentration. The largest Medline Brand product categories include Sterile Procedure Trays, Exam Gloves and Personal Care, which accounted for $1.3 billion, $1.1 billion and $0.7 billion of revenue in 2020, respectively. Medline Brand products yield significantly higher profitability and can generate over 4x higher margins than Distributed Products. In total, Medline Brand products represented 84% of our total gross profit in 2020 versus Distributed Products representing 16%. While Distributed Products are less profitable for us, by offering our customers a complete assortment of med-surg products, we are able to solidify our customer relationships which increases satisfaction and stickiness, and creates the foundation for additional Medline Brand product sales over time.",N/A,as_expected,2021,482

We ingrain ourselves with our customers and are uniquely positioned in the market as both a manufacturer and distributor, allowing us to identify customer needs and develop products and solutions to address those needs. This position in the market enables us to identify opportunities to provide our clients with value-added product innovations and lower cost solutions through our Medline Brand products. 116 ----- We benefit from a highly synergistic relationship between our sales force and product divisions. With a high number of touch points and frequent dialogue with customers, our sales force is able to identify customer needs and collaborates with our product divisions to develop solutions to address those needs. In turn, our product divisions rely upon our sales force’s access to every corner of healthcare, enabling broad applicability for their products.

We have also received over 1,200 granted patents with over 600 pending applications. Further, we are able to utilize our highly attractive platform capable of realizing significant synergies to acquire complementary assets that may be less efficient to develop in-house. Evidence of this is our recent acquisition of a significant portion of the Hudson RCI brand of respiratory products from Teleflex, which added the brand’s oxygen and aerosol therapy, active humidification and pulmonary hygiene products to complement our existing respiratory portfolio in order to meet the market needs by bolstering our respiratory product portfolio and increasing domestic and international channel access.

A hospital typically awards a single prime vendor contract to one distributor. The contract is a long-term agreement between the customer and distributor for the distributor to provide the vast majority—often 100%—of the customer’s med-surg product needs. This provides essential simplicity and greater cost savings to the Acute Care hospital by centralizing all purchases with a single partner, and provides us with better customer coordination and increased visibility into customer purchasing behavior across our own and third-party brands that we sell, creating opportunities for partnership and growth. As healthcare systems continue to consolidate, IDNs now own and control many sites of care beyond the acute care setting. These IDNs are increasingly seeking a supply chain partner with reliable manufacturing and distribution capabilities who can serve the entire continuum of care. We have a differentiated ability to contract with customers for their needs across the entire continuum, including the acute care setting along with the alternate sites of care such as physician offices, ambulatory surgery centers, home health, hospice and others. Evidence of our differentiated value is our average of over 60% win rate on requests for proposal since 2018. As the only prime vendor partner with the full capability to serve the entire continuum of care, we are highly differentiated and well positioned to continue to win new business. Importantly, we expect this trend of IDN consolidation to continue, providing a growth opportunity moving forward. 117 ----- As of December 31, 2020, we had over 850 active prime vendor relationships, generating approximately 52% (approximately $9.2 billion) of our 2020 revenue. With these prime vendor contracts, we distribute both products from other product manufacturers / OEMs and our own Medline Brand products. At the beginning of a new prime vendor relationship, Distributed Products typically represent approximately 90% of sales. Once these contracts are signed, the strength of our vertically integrated model and the quality and pricing of our Medline Brand products encourages customers to increasingly convert from Distributed Products to Medline Brand products. Our compelling value proposition offers customers 5% to 8% of cost savings when they convert to Medline Brand Products, while also providing us with better economics and profitability on our revenue.",N/A,as_expected,2021,482

In the first year of a prime vendor contract, we have historically been able to shift product mix to Medline Brand by approximately an incremental 10% to achieve approximately 20% Medline Brand mix. In the years thereafter, customers have historically continued to convert to Medline Brand products and increase product mix on average 2% to 3% each year through additional customer service and product innovation efforts. Our customers are also incentivized to increase their Medline Brand portfolio penetration, which, in turn, allows them to decrease their cost of distribution on Distributed Products manufactured by other suppliers. After five years, our typical experience is that Medline Brand represents approximately over 35% of a contract, and a mature run-rate contract can be 45% to over 50% Medline Brand. As customers become more price sensitive and they are increasingly able to realize the value and quality delivered by Medline Brand products, we expect this Medline Brand product mix will accelerate and increase above 35% in less than five years. 118",N/A,as_expected,2021,482

Our key competitors are other leading medical product manufacturers and OEMs including Becton Dickinson / Bard, 3M, Stryker, Baxter and Medtronic.

Notably, adults aged 65 and older, whose population is expected to grow the fastest and represent 21% of the population by 2030 compared to 15% in 2016 according to the U.S. Census Bureau, have the highest prevalence of chronic conditions and spend approximately three times more than working adults in annual healthcare spend. Of total U.S. healthcare spend in 2019, hospital expenditures amounted to $1.2 trillion and physician and clinical services expenditures amounted to $772 billion.

In the United States, over 2,000 acute providers, 3,300 post-acute care providers, 195,000 physician groups and 5,700 ambulatory surgery centers utilize med-surg products to provide safe and effective care to patients across the continuum. These products are critical in nature, range in offering and complexity, and are largely single-use, disposable items which must be replenished and replaced regularly. Examples include incontinence briefs and wipes, personal protective equipment (“PPE”), including gowns, masks, headwear and footwear, IV start and dressing change kits, textiles, advanced and traditional wound care, durable medical equipment, surgical drapes and gowns, bathing systems, skin care, sterilization wraps, fluid management kits, urology trays, bladder scanners and general diagnostics. Med-surg products are primarily manufactured by a fragmented base of over 4,000 OEMs who typically sell a majority of products through distributors. In addition to aggregating inventory from fragmented suppliers and delivering products to end customer providers, select distributors including Medline, also self-manufacture products and sell directly to healthcare providers. The vast majority of healthcare providers do not keep substantial inventory on hand, which has created an industry expectation for products to be in stock and delivered in short timeframes, such as the next day. Therefore, having scale and a robust geographic footprint with strategically located warehousing and distribution facilities is essential to effectively and efficiently serve customers. The widened global need for PPE and other medical supplies during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 further highlighted this, and Medline responded to the crisis by delivering 80% more PPE than any other single U.S. provider, solidifying our status as a critical partner to our customers and opening new customer opportunities across the continuum of care.

We employ approximately 28,000 employees worldwide with over 18,100 located in the United States. The largest non-U.S. employee populations are in Mexico, India, Canada, France, Japan, China, Australia, Slovakia and Germany. None of our employees in the United States are unionized, though some of our employees in Mexico belong to unions and employees in Germany and France belong to works councils. Employees in Italy, Belgium and Spain are subject to industry collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our positive employee relations and total employee experience drive the continual growth of our workforce. Medline’s tremendous growth and remarkable success would not be possible without the engagement and commitment of our diverse employee base. We have developed a strong foundation that drives our recruitment, retention and development efforts. The following defined Medline Success Factors are at the foundational core of all of our human capital strategies: - Focus on the customer - Deliver results - Sense of urgency - Sound judgment - Strong work ethic - Build effective relationships Medline is committed to supporting the personal and professional development of our employees, as well as providing competitive benefits and a safe, inclusive workplace. We believe that these measures help us to retain our employees and attract new ones. As part of this commitment, we have, among other things: - Developed a strong, collaborative workplace community. We believe our employees’ ability to communicate and cooperate effectively across functional and departmental teams positively impacts our performance. We engage in various listening strategies including our engagement survey, focus groups, our “Speak Up” and “Open Talk” communication platforms, our increased attention to onboarding and offboarding feedback, pulse surveys on remote work needs, as well as our recent inclusion and diversity listening sessions in the United States and subsequent launch of various diversity employee resource groups. On a global level, we conduct an employee engagement survey generally every two to three years to analyze the progress we have made as a company and to identify areas in which our employees feel there is room for improvement. The results from our employee surveys are used to implement programs and processes designed to further enhance our culture. Over 126 ----- 16,000 employees (in the United States and abroad) participated in our latest employee survey conducted in 2019 by Willis Towers Watson. Highlights include: - 87% of respondents indicated that they were proud to be Medline employees and 85% of respondents indicated they strongly believed in the goals and objectives of Medline, while 91% indicated that they were willing to put in extra effort beyond what is normally expected to help Medline succeed as a company. - We consistently score particularly strong with customer focus. For example, 84% of respondents agree that we deliver on our promises to customers and 85% indicated that Medline has a deep understanding of what customers think is important. Likewise, 85% of respondents also indicated that they can do what they need to serve customers. These scores are on par or better than the Willis Towers Watson benchmarks for high performance companies. - Committed to hiring the best. Our dedicated talent acquisition team strives to hire employees quickly and efficiently that meet the specific needs of our divisions. Through continuous improvement of internal processes, an awareness of market and candidate driven trends and in partnership with vendors and other outside organizations, our talent acquisition team identifies and attracts candidates that have the skills, experience and temperament to help Medline achieve business results. Medline’s leadership continues to partner with our Talent Acquisition team with an increased focus on building diverse slates to drive more representation throughout all divisions of Medline. - Committed to development of our employees and providing greater opportunities than our competitors. Medline is particularly good at identifying talent early in career and developing people quickly. We provide early opportunity and responsibility in many divisions to tap the hunger of those driven to succeed and grow quickly. These on-the-job opportunities are augmented by formal training and development to refine skills and leadership competencies. Our sales representatives participate in a robust comprehensive sales training progam, receiving on average, more than six weeks of training and education per year, resulting in an understanding of selling strategy, customer expectations, product and clinical knowledge. Product manager learning and development offerings are designed to train and retain product managers through all stages of their careers from mandatory onboarding offerings to advanced classes to aid in growth and increasing levels of responsibility. Additionally, Medline believes in the value of diversity and inclusion in our workforce. Our Employee Resource Groups have played a critical role in building awareness around inclusion and diversity topics. We have trained over 1,800 people leaders to avoid bias in their key talent decisions (hires, development, promotions) as part of our efforts to build a supportive and inclusive environment. - Promoted employee and community well-being. We encourage physical, emotional and financial fitness and offer programs and benefits to help employees lead healthier lives overall. When we identify a need, we pivot quickly to take action. For example, as the pandemic was taking a toll on employee mental health, we quickly launched mindfulness and resiliency programs, implemented a new mental health program in the United States with 24/7 support through Ginger, launched an expanded Employee Assistance Plan pilot in Europe and provided mental health safety/suicide awareness training for HR and people leaders in the United States. We also promote corporate social responsibility and give employees opportunities to give back to their communities. Medline is also giving back through financial support for nonprofit organizations, including over $1 million donated to inclusion and diversity causes in the wake of the killing of George Floyd. - Supported employee health and safety. In addition to offering competitive health and well-being programs and other benefits to eligible employees, we are committed to providing a safe and secure work environment for all employees. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented many policy and procedure changes and new benefits in an effort to protect our employees and customers, and to support appropriate health and safety protocols as summarized below. These protocols meet or exceed health and safety standards required by federal, state and local government agencies, and are 127 ----- based on guidance from the CDC and other public health authorities. Actions taken in response to the pandemic included: - Quickly pivoting to provide remote work options for nonfrontline personnel, including support to ensure proper resources, technology, system security, remote work stipends and virtual processes/ training. Most office employee functions have been fully remote since mid-March 2020 and we anticipate returning in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2021; - Developing new methods to recruit and onboard employees in a remote environment; - Developing protocols for onsite work to meet CDC and local requirements, as well as best practice for symptom screening, temperature checks, facial coverings, social distancing, capacity limits, staggered shifts, contact tracing, notifications and quarantining; - Canceling group meetings and trainings, shifted to virtual arrangements to enable business and development to continue; - Implementing extensive cleaning and sanitation processes to protect employees throughout our facilities; - Installing numerous hand sanitizer stations and providing face masks for onsite workers; - Adding a variety of new benefits and compensation options for our frontline employees including additional paid time off, COVID-19 quarantine pay, critical response pay, additional paid time off for vaccination, volunteer leave for our nurses and licensed healthcare professionals and more flexibility with unpaid leave needs; - Amending benefit plans to enable more flexible and favorable terms in connection with COVID-19 related events and to avail ourselves of lifted requirements with retirement, flexible spending and medical plans; - Sending care packages to the homes of our employees in 2020 on two occasions with masks and hand sanitizer, when such items were difficult to purchase, to demonstrate appreciation of our employees and their families; - Organizing onsite vaccination events at various sites; - Promoting vaccination education, including hosting live question and answer sessions with medical doctors; - Incentivizing vaccination with additional paid time off for frontline employees in 2021 and health insurance discounts for 2022; and - Addressing return to office needs, testing options, vaccination mandates for certain positions, and ongoing safety protocols.",N/A,as_expected,2021,482

664,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.54,Government Regulation,17.54.1,Government regulation of medical devices,"Our medical devices are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies, including the FDA and comparable foreign agencies. The FDA and other U.S. and foreign governmental agencies regulate, among other things, with respect to medical devices: design, development and manufacturing; testing, labeling, content and language of instructions for use and storage; clinical trials; product safety; marketing, sales and distribution; premarket clearance and approval; record keeping procedures; advertising and promotion; recalls and field safety corrective actions; postmarket surveillance, including reporting of deaths or serious injuries and malfunctions that, if they were to recur, could lead to death or serious injury; postmarket approval studies; and product import and export. The regulations to which we are subject are complex and have tended to become more stringent over time. Regulatory changes could result in restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations, higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated sales. The FDA and state regulatory authorities have broad inspection and enforcement powers, including the ability to suspend or limit the distribution of products by our distribution centers, seize or order the recall of products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations. Foreign regulations subject us to similar foreign enforcement powers. _FDA premarket clearance and approval requirements_ Each medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the United States must first receive 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA application from the FDA, unless specifically exempt. The FDA classifies all 129 ----- medical devices into one of three classes. Devices deemed to pose lower risk are categorized as either Class I or Class II. Certain of these lower risk devices are subjct to the 510(k) process, while others are exempt. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life sustaining, life-supporting, selected implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously 510(k) cleared device, are categorized as Class III, generally requiring submission and approval of a PMA. _510(k) clearance process_ To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must submit a premarket notification to the FDA demonstrating the proposed device to be substantially equivalent to a predicate device. The standard review process for 510(k)s is between 6 to 9 months, dependent upon the type of 510(k) filing submitted. Although many 510(k) premarket notifications are cleared without clinical data, in some cases, the FDA may require clinical data to support substantial equivalence. In reviewing a premarket notification, the FDA may request additional information, including clinical data, which may significantly prolong the review process and clearance is never assured. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any subsequent modification of the device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require submission and approval of a PMA application in cases where new indications are sought for which there is no predicate. Non-significant changes are handled via internal documentation by the Company. Each manufacturer must judge the significance of modifications based on algorithms within FDA 510(k) guidance documents. FDA may review any such decision and may disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained. In the future, we may make modifications to our products after they have received FDA clearance or approval and in appropriate circumstances, determine that new clearance or approval is unnecessary. However, the FDA may disagree with our determination and if the FDA requires us to seek 510(k) clearance or submit new PMA applications for any modifications to a previously cleared product, we may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until we obtain the required clearance or approval. Under these circumstances, we may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or other penalties. _Post-Marketing Requirements_ After a medical device is placed on the market, numerous FDA regulatory requirements apply, including, but not limited to the following: QSRs, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process; Establishment Registration, which requires establishments involved in the production and distribution of medical devices, intended for commercial distribution in the United States, to register with the FDA; Medical Device Listing, which requires manufacturers to list the devices they have in commercial distribution with the FDA; Labeling regulations, which prohibit “misbranded” devices from entering the market, as well as prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or off-label uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; Postmarket surveillance, including MDR requirements which requires manufacturers to report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur; and Corrections and Removal Reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the United States Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that may present a risk to health. The FDA enforces these requirements by inspection and market surveillance. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include one or more of the following sanctions: untitled letters or warning letters; fines, injunctions and civil penalties; mandatory recall or seizure of our products; administrative detention or banning of our products; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusing our request for 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals 130 ----- for new product versions or modifications to existing product versions; revocation of 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals previously granted; and criminal prosecution and penalties. _International regulation of medical devices_ Sales of medical devices outside the United States are subject to foreign government regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. In order to market our products in other countries, we must comply with applicable regulatory requirements and approvals and safety and quality regulations in each country in which the product is marketed. The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval and the requirements may differ significantly. _EU Regulation of Medical Devices_ The global regulatory environment is increasingly stringent and unpredictable. For example, in the EU, a new Medical Device Regulation, which became effective in May 2021, imposes significant additional premarket and post-market requirements. In addition, several countries that did not have regulatory requirements governing the manufacture and distribution of medical products have established such requirements in recent years, and other countries have expanded, or plan to expand, their existing regulations. While harmonization of global regulations has been pursued, requirements continue to differ significantly among countries. We expect this global regulatory environment will continue to evolve, which could impact the cost and the time needed to approve medical products, and ultimately, our ability to maintain existing approvals or obtain future approvals for our products. Regulations of the U.S. FDA and other regulatory agencies in and outside the United States impose extensive compliance and monitoring obligations on portions of our business. These agencies review our design and manufacturing practices, labeling, record keeping, and manufacturers’ required reports of adverse experiences and other information to identify potential problems with medical products. We are also subject to periodic inspections for compliance with applicable quality system regulations, which govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, and servicing of finished medical products intended for human use. In addition, the U.S. FDA and other regulatory bodies, both in and outside the United States (including the Federal Trade Commission, the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Justice, and various state Attorneys General), monitor the promotion and advertising of our products. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may limit our ability to effectively market and sell our products, limit our ability to obtain future premarket authorizations or result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations. _Trade Regulations_ The movement of products, services and investment across borders subjects us to extensive trade regulations. A variety of laws and regulations in the countries in which we transact business apply to the sale, shipment and provision of goods, services and technology across borders. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, our import, export and other business activities. We are also subject to the risk that these laws and regulations could change in a way that would expose us to additional costs, penalties or liabilities. Some governments also impose economic sanctions against certain countries, governments, persons and entities, both for unlawful or malign conduct and to discourage or prevent entities from abiding by other countries’ laws. In addition to our need to comply with such regulations in connection with our direct activities, we also sell and provide goods, technology and services to agents, representatives and distributors who may export such items to customers and end-users. If we, or the third parties through which we do business, are not in compliance with applicable import, export control or economic sanctions laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action, and varying degrees of liability. Such actions may disrupt or delay sales of our products or services or result in restrictions on our distribution and sales of products or services that may materially impact our business. 131 ----- _Anti-Boycott Laws_ Under U.S. laws and regulations, U.S. companies and their subsidiaries and affiliates are prohibited from participating or agreeing to participate in unsanctioned foreign boycotts in connection with certain business activities, including the sale, purchase, transfer, shipping or financing of goods or services within the United States or between the United States and countries outside of the United States. If we, or certain third parties through which we sell or provide goods or services, violate U.S. anti-boycott laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action and varying degrees of liability. _Data Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations_ Our business involves the collection, use, storage, disclosure and processing of PII of our employees, customers and other third parties as well as PHI in our capacity as a Covered Entity as defined under HIPAA and in some instances, as a Business Associate as defined under HIPAA on behalf of our customers for certain parts of our business. We are directly or indirectly subject to numerous and evolving federal, state and foreign laws and regulations relating to the collection, use, storage, retention, security, disclosure, transfer, return, destruction and processing of PII and PHI, such as HIPAA, TCPA, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, the GDPR as well as U.S state privacy laws such as the CCPA, and state data breach notification laws. HIPAA establishes privacy and security standards that limit our use and disclosure of PHI and requires us to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of PHI, as well as to notify affected individuals, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights (“OCR”), and, in breaches involving 500 individuals or more, the media, of breaches of unsecured PHI when we are acting as a Covered Entity. If we are acting as a Business Associate, we must notify our Covered Entity clients of breaches of unsecured PHI and security incidents. HIPAA contain substantial restrictions and requirements with respect to the use and disclosure of certain PHI. If we were to be found to have breached our obligations under HIPAA, we could be subject to enforcement actions by OCR and state health regulators and lawsuits, including class action law suits, by private plaintiffs. In addition, OCR performs compliance audits in order to proactively enforce the HIPAA privacy and security standards. OCR has the discretion to impose penalties and may require companies to enter into resolution agreements and corrective action plans which impose ongoing compliance requirements. OCR enforcement activity can result in financial liability and reputational harm, and responses to such enforcement activity can consume significant internal resources. In addition to enforcement by OCR, state Attorneys General are authorized to bring civil actions under either HIPAA or relevant state laws seeking either injunctions or damages in response to violations that threaten the privacy of state residents. In addition to HIPAA, we must adhere to state patient confidentiality laws that are not pre-empted by HIPAA, including those that are more stringent than HIPAA requirements. Numerous other state, federal and foreign laws, including consumer protection laws and regulations, govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality and security of patient health information. In addition, Congress and some states are considering new laws and regulations that further protect the privacy and security of medical records or medical information. With the recent increase in publicity regarding data breaches resulting in improper dissemination of consumer information, all states have passed laws regulating the actions that a business must take if it experiences a data breach, such as prompt disclosure to affected customers. The FTC and states’ Attorneys General have also brought enforcement actions and prosecuted some data breach cases as unfair and/or deceptive acts or practices under the FTC Act. Further, the CPRA, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act and the Colorado Privacy Act become effective on January 1, 2023, and other states may soon pass their own data privacy laws. While the current state privacy laws generally contain certain exemptions for data subject to HIPAA, there is no guarantee that future laws will contain similar exemptions. Similarly, many foreign laws and regulations, including in countries in which we currently operate, govern the collection, storage, use, processing, disclosure, protection, transmission, retention and disposal of PII. For 132 ----- example, GDPR imposes strict requirements for controllers and processors in any country with respect to the PII of EU and UK residents, including, for example, limitations on data processing, sharing and retention, requirements of consents and notices to data subjects, rights of data subjects in their PII and strict requirements for how data may be transferred to so called “third countries”, including the United States. Ensuring compliance with GDPR is an ongoing commitment that involves substantial costs, and despite our efforts, data protection authorities or others (including individual consumers) may assert that our business practices fail to comply with its requirements. If our operations are found to violate GDPR requirements, we may incur substantial fines and other penalties, including bans on processing and transferring PII, required changes to our business practices, and reputational harm, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business. Serious breaches of GDPR can result in regulatory fines of up to 4.0% of our annual worldwide revenues or up to €20 million, whichever is higher. Such penalties are in addition to any other civil litigation claims. Laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection are continually evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations by various courts and regulators. The effects of the new privacy laws are potentially far-reaching, and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and incur substantial compliance-related costs and expenses, and it remains unclear how various provisions will be interpreted and enforced by the courts and regulators. In addition to our product offerings, we also provide electronic medical devices and other digital tools which can connect to each other and to other technology. Many of the laws referenced above also contain requirements to have appropriate techincal and organizational security controls and measures in place for such technologies and techincal infrastructure. We must manage the information security as well as privacy risks of these connected systems to ensure secure and effective exchange and use of exchanged information. Perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services, or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our products or services to comply with applicable legal or contractual data privacy and security requirements, may not only cause us significant reputational harm, but may also lead to claims against us by our customers and/or governmental agencies and involve substantial fines, penalties and other liabilities and expenses and costs for remediation. Although we take reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable laws and regulations and have invested and continue to invest human and technology resources into data privacy compliance efforts, there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to regulatory or individual legal action, including fines, in the event of a security incident or other claim that a consumer’s privacy rights have been violated. We could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in our business practices or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. _Regulations Governing Reimbursement_ Certain of our businesses involve the marketing and sale of, and third-party payment for, med-surg products that are subject to extensive state, federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations. U.S. laws and regulations are imposed primarily in connection with federally funded healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, as well as the government’s interest in regulating the quality and cost of healthcare. Other governments also impose regulations in connection with their healthcare reimbursement programs and the delivery of healthcare items and services. Our med-surg products are purchased principally by hospitals or physicians that typically bill various thirdparty payers, including federally-funded healthcare programs private insurance plans and managed care plans, for the healthcare services provided to their patients. We also directly submit claims and other information to federally-funded healthcare programs for certain DMEPOS or DME, through our Managed Care division. U.S. federal healthcare laws apply when we or customers submit claims for items or services that are reimbursed under federally-funded healthcare programs, including laws related to kickbacks, false claims, self-referrals and healthcare fraud. There are often similar state false claims, anti-kickback and anti-self-referral laws that apply to products or services covered by state Medicaid and other healthcare programs and private third-party payers. 133 ----- Key federal fraud and abuse laws include the federal Anti-Kickback Statue (“AKS”), Stark Law, False Claims Act, and Civil Monetary Penalties Law (“CMP Law”). The AKS prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, by Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including cash, improper discounts and free or reduced price items and services. Among other things, the AKS has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not meet the requirements of a statutory or regulatory exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the AKS. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare program-covered business, the AKS has been violated. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Violations are subject to civil monetary penalties up to $104,330 for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved, and may result in criminal fines of up to $100,000 and imprisonment of up to ten years, or exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs. Further, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal AKS also constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Federal law also includes a provision commonly known as the “Stark Law,” which prohibits a physician from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to an entity providing “designated health services,” which includes DME, if the physician or immediate family member of the physician, has an ownership or investment interest or compensation arrangement with such entity that does not comply with the requirements of a Stark exception. Violation of the Stark Law could result in denial of payment, disgorgement of reimbursements received under a non-compliant arrangement, civil penalties, and exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs. The federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to or approval by the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the U.S. government. Violations of the False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the False Claims Act and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies throughout the country. Manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved or off-label uses and other sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements under the False Claims Act in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. When an entity is determined to have violated the federal civil False Claims Act, the government may impose civil fines and penalties ranging from $11,665 to $23,331 for each false claim, plus treble damages, and exclude the entity from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. In addition, companies found liable under the False Claims Act have been forced to implement extensive corrective action plans, and have often become subject to consent decrees or corporate 134 ----- integrity agreements, severely restricting the manner in which they conduct their business and imposing ongoing reporting and disclosure obligations. Most states have adopted similar state false claims laws, and these state laws have their own penalties, which may be in addition to federal False Claims Act penalties, The federal CMP Law imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. The fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject to heightened enforcement activity over the past few years, and significant enforcement activity has been the result of qui tam “relators” who serve as whistleblowers by filing complaints in the name of the United States (and if applicable, particular states) under applicable false claims laws, and who may receive up to 30% of total government recoveries. Penalties under fraud and abuse laws may be severe, and could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs, including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state healthcare programs, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Also, these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that governmental authorities will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws. Even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs. In addition, as a manufacturer of U.S. FDA-cleared devices reimbursable by federal healthcare programs, we are subject to the Physician Payments Sunshine Act (the “Sunshine Act”), which requires us to annually report certain payments and other transfers of value we make to U.S.-licensed physicians (and certain other healthcare professionals) or U.S. teaching hospitals. The Sunshine Act pre-empts similar state reporting laws, although we or our subsidiaries may be required to report under certain state transparency laws that address circumstances not covered by the Sunshine Act, and some of these state laws, as well as the federal law, can be ambiguous. We are also subject to foreign regulations requiring transparency of certain interactions between suppliers and their customers. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us or our officers and employees to criminal and civil financial penalties. While we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations, and have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance, we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law, or interpretation of laws, or changes in our services or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws, or failure to comply with applicable law, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Implementation of legislative or regulatory reforms to reimbursement systems, or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of these systems in coverage or reimbursement, could significantly reduce reimbursement or result in the denial of coverage, which could have an impact on the acceptance of and demand for our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them. _Environmental Health and Safety Requirements_ We are subject to various environmental health and safety (“EHS”) requirements both within and outside the United States. Like other companies in our industry, our manufacturing and other operations involve air emissions, wastewater and stormwater discharges, and the storage, use and management of hazardous and other sensitive materials, and the disposal of hazardous waste. We are also subject to requirements relating to safe working conditions and laboratory practices. Our operations involve the use of substances regulated under EHS requirements, primarily in our manufacturing and sterilization processes. We believe we have implemented policies, practices and procedures that enable us to comply with applicable EHS requirements. However, EHS 135 ----- requirements may be detailed and complex, and we sometimes have been cited for violations of such requirements and may be cited for violations in the future. In addition, many such requirements are becoming increasingly stringent, and we are sometimes required to make changes to our operations for continued compliance, which can require substantial capital investments as well as increases in operating costs. For example, we, as well as others in our industry, rely on EtO to sterilize certain medical products that we manufacture. In light of evolving science regarding risks relared to EtO exposure, regulatory actions have been taken by some jurisdictions to reduce EtO emissions, and we have made substantial improvements to our two primary EtO sterilization facilities to meet such requirements and otherwise manage EtO emissions. _Operating, Security and Licensure Standards_ We are subject to certain operational, security, and licensure requirements, including the federal Drug Supply Chain Security Act (“DSCSA”) in the United States, which mandates an industry-wide, national serialization system for pharmaceutical packaging with a ten-year phase-in process. By November 2018, all manufacturers and re-packagers were required to mark each prescription drug package with a unique serialized code. The DSCSA also establishes certain requirements for the licensing and operation of prescription drug wholesalers and third-party logistics providers (“3PLs”), and includes the eventual creation of national wholesaler and 3PL licenses in cases where states do not license such entities. In addition, with respect to our DME business, we are subject to certain state licensure laws (including state pharmacy laws), and also certain accreditation standards, including to qualify for reimbursement from Medicare and other third-party payers. We are also subject to FDA’s unique device identification system requirements, which require “labelers” to include unique device identifiers (“UDIs”), with a content and format prescribed by the FDA and issued under a system operated by an FDA-accredited issuing agency, on the labels and packages of medical devices, and to directly mark certain devices with UDIs. The UDI regulations also require labelers to submit certain information concerning UDI-labeled devices to the FDA. Certain of our businesses are also required to register for permits and/or licenses with various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well as comparable foreign agencies, and certain accrediting bodies, depending on the type of operations and location of product distribution, manufacturing or sale. These businesses include those that distribute, manufacture and/or repackage medical products, or own pharmacy operations. _Antitrust and Consumer Protection_ The federal government of the United States, most U.S. states and many foreign countries have antitrust laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anti-competitive, as well as consumer protection laws that seek to protect consumers from improper business practices. At the U.S. federal level, the Federal Trade Commission oversees enforcement of these types of laws, and states have similar government agencies. Violations of antitrust or consumer protection laws may result in various sanctions, including criminal and civil penalties. Private plaintiffs may also bring civil lawsuits against us in the United States for alleged antitrust law violations, including claims for treble damages. EU law also regulates competition and provides for detailed rules protecting consumers. _International Transactions_ U.S. and foreign import and export laws and regulations require us to abide by certain standards relating to the importation and exportation of products, including but not limited to the absence of forced labor in our supply chain. We also are subject to certain laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, U.S. export control laws, the U.K. Bribery Act, German anticorruption laws and other anti-bribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records, as well as other types of foreign requirements similar to those imposed in the United States. 136 ----- While we believe that we are substantially compliant with the foregoing laws and regulations promulgated thereunder and possess all material permits and licenses required for the conduct of our business, there can be no assurance that regulations that impact our business or customers’ practices will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2021,482

To varying degrees, each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, distribution and postmarketing surveillance of our products. The United States and other countries where we sell regulated healthcare products subject such products to their own approval and other regulatory requirements regarding performance, safety, and quality of our products. We are also subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments and authorities in the locations in which we conduct our business. The governmental and regulatory authorities that enforce such laws include, without limitation, the U.S. FDA, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of the HHS, the U.S. Department of Justice and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, as well as state and local governments. Our business is also affected by patient and data privacy laws, government payer cost containment initiatives, government reimbursement laws and regulations, environmental health and safety laws and regulations, as well as laws and regulations with respect to the sale, transportation, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, and safe working conditions.

From and after the Completion Date, Holdings and certain of the Issuer’s Restricted Subsidiaries (as detailed below) will guarantee the Secured Notes. The Issuer’s existing or future Foreign Subsidiaries, existing or future FSHCO Subsidiaries, any future Securitization Subsidiaries or any future Captive Insurance Subsidiaries are not expected to guarantee the Secured Notes, other than certain Domestic Subsidiaries that are direct or indirect Subsidiaries of a Foreign Subsidiary. The Guarantors, as primary obligors and not merely as sureties, will jointly and severally guarantee, fully and unconditionally, on a senior secured basis, the performance and full and punctual payment when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of the Issuers under the Secured Indenture and the Secured Notes, whether for payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Secured Notes or expenses, indemnification or otherwise, on the terms set forth in the Secured Indenture by executing the Secured Indenture or a supplement thereto. As further described in “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries,” in the future, certain additional Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer that guarantee certain 150 ----- Indebtedness of the Issuers or any Subsidiary Guarantor will guarantee the Secured Notes, subject to certain exceptions and subject to release and discharge as described in this “Description of Secured Notes.” Each of the Guarantees will be: - a general senior obligation of such Guarantor; - equal in right of payment with any existing and future Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor; - senior in right of payment to any future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Guarantee of such Guarantor; - secured on a first-priority basis by the Collateral owned by such Guarantor, subject to certain Liens permitted under the Secured Indenture; - equal in priority as to the Collateral owned by such Guarantor with respect to any other Pari Passu Obligations of such Guarantor; - effectively senior to all existing and future unsecured Indebtedness of such Guarantor, to the extent of the value of the Collateral owned by such Guarantor; - effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is secured by Liens on assets that do not constitute a part of the Collateral to the extent of the value of such assets; and - structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness, claims of holders of Preferred Stock and other liabilities of such Guarantor’s Subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Secured Notes (other than the Issuers). As of June 26, 2021, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions: - the Issuer and the Guarantors would have had approximately $14,772 million in total indebtedness outstanding (excluding approximately $18 million of issued and undrawn letters of credit), none of which would have been subordinated and of which approximately $10,770 million would have been senior secured indebtedness, consisting of $7,000 million of borrowings under the New Term Loan Facilities and approximately $3,770 million of the Secured Notes; - the Issuer would have had approximately $982 million of availability to incur additional secured indebtedness under the New Revolving Credit Facility (after giving effect to approximately $18 million of letters of credit expected to be outstanding thereunder); and - the CMBS Borrower Subsidiaries would have had approximately $2,230 million of secured indebtedness outstanding under the CMBS Loan (and/or the Alternative RE Borrower would have had up to $2,200 million of borrowings outstanding under the Alternative RE Term Loan Facility borrowed in lieu thereof). From and after the Completion Date, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries (other than the CMBS Borrower Subsidiaries) are expected to be “Restricted Subsidiaries” unless designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries in accordance with the Secured Indenture. Under certain circumstances, we will be permitted to designate certain of our existing and future subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” As of and for the twelve months ended June 26, 2021, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions (assuming we consummate the Initial CMBS Financing through CMBS Loans in full), our Unrestricted Subsidiaries (which we initially expect to be only the CMBS Borrower Subsidiaries) represented approximately 7.8% of our total assets and 11.3% of our total liabilities and had no revenue other than the payments under the Master Lease (as defined under “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Master Lease”). Any Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Secured Indenture and will not guarantee the Secured Notes.

In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or similar proceeding of any of our non-guarantor Subsidiaries, such non-guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Issuer or a Guarantor. As a result, all of the existing and future liabilities of our non-guarantor Subsidiaries, including any claims of trade creditors, will be structurally senior to the Secured Notes and the Guarantees. The Secured Indenture does not limit the amount of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness which may be incurred by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries, including the non-guarantor Subsidiaries. As of the Completion Date, Holdings and each Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer that guarantees the Senior Secured Credit Facilities will guarantee the Secured Notes. The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law. This provision may not, however, be effective to protect a Guarantee from being voided under fraudulent transfer law, or may reduce the applicable Guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its Guarantee worthless. If a Guarantee was rendered voidable, it could be subordinated by a court to all other indebtedness (including guarantees and other contingent liabilities) of the Guarantor, and, depending on the amount of such indebtedness, a Guarantor’s liability on its Guarantee could be reduced to zero. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to our Indebtedness and the Notes—Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws permit a court, under certain circumstances, to void the notes and the guarantees, and the liens securing the secured notes and the related guarantees, subordinate claims in respect of the notes, the guarantees and the liens securing the secured notes and the related guarantees and/or require holders of the notes to return payments received from us in respect of the guarantees and the liens and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the notes.” Any Guarantor that makes a payment under its Guarantee will be entitled upon payment in full of all guaranteed obligations under the Secured Indenture to a contribution from each other Guarantor in an amount equal to such other Guarantor’s pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of all the Guarantors at the time of such payment determined in accordance with GAAP. Each Guarantor may consolidate with, amalgamate or merge with or into or wind up into, or consummate a Division as a Dividing Person, or sell all or substantially all its assets to the Issuer or another Guarantor without limitation or any other Person upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Secured Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets.” Each Guarantee by a Guarantor will provide by its terms that it will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon: (1) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, any sale, exchange, issuance, disposition or transfer (by merger, amalgamation, consolidation, dividend, distribution or otherwise) of (i) the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary Guarantor, after which the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary or (ii) all or substantially all the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor, in each case if such sale, exchange, issuance, disposition or transfer is made in compliance with or is not prohibited by the applicable provisions of the Secured Indenture (including any amendments thereof); (2) the release or discharge of the guarantee by, or direct obligation of, such Guarantor of Indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, or the release or discharge of such other guarantee or direct obligation that resulted in the creation of such Guarantee, except a discharge or release by or as a result of payment under such guarantee or direct obligation (it being understood that a release subject to a contingent reinstatement will constitute a release for the purposes of this provision, and that if any such Guarantee is so reinstated, such Guarantee shall also be reinstated to the extent that such Guarantor would then be required to provide a Guarantee pursuant to the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries”); 152 ----- (3) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, the designation of any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Secured Indenture or the occurrence of any event following which the Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Secured Indenture; (4) upon the merger, amalgamation, consolidation or Division of any Guarantor with and into the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or another Guarantor or upon the liquidation or winding up of such Guarantor, in each case, in compliance with or in a manner not prohibited by the applicable provisions of the Secured Indenture; (5) the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event; (6) as described under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver” or in accordance with the provisions of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement; (7) the exercise by the Issuers of their legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as described under “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or the discharge of the Issuers’ obligations under the Secured Indenture in accordance with the terms of the Secured Indenture; or (8) in the case of Holdings, if Holdings ceases to be the direct parent of the Issuer as a result of a transaction or designation permitted pursuant to the definition of “Holdings”. Notwithstanding clause (5) above, if, after any Covenant Suspension Event, a Reversion Date shall occur, then the Suspension Period with respect to such Covenant Suspension Event shall terminate and all actions reasonably necessary to provide that the Secured Notes shall have been unconditionally guaranteed by each Guarantor (to the extent such guarantee is required by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants— Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries”) shall be taken within 90 days after such Reversion Date or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter. Upon any occurrence giving rise to a release of a Guarantee, as specified above, the Trustee, subject to receipt of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer and at the Issuers’ expense, will execute such documents reasonably requested by the Issuer in order to evidence or effect such release, discharge and termination in respect of such Guarantee. None of the Issuers, the Trustee or any Guarantor will be required to make a notation on the notes to reflect any such release, discharge or termination. The Trustee shall not be liable for any such release undertaken in reliance upon any such Officer’s Certificate. Prior to the Escrow Release Date (if the Escrow Conditions are not satisfied on or prior to the Issue Date), the Unsecured Notes will be guaranteed only by Holdings. From and after the Completion Date, Holdings and certain of the Issuer’s Restricted Subsidiaries (as detailed below) will guarantee the Unsecured Notes. The Issuer’s existing or future Foreign Subsidiaries, existing or future FSHCO Subsidiaries, any future Securitization Subsidiaries or any future Captive Insurance Subsidiaries are not expected to guarantee the Unsecured Notes, other than certain Domestic Subsidiaries that are direct or indirect Subsidiaries of a Foreign Subsidiary.

As further described in “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries,” in the future, certain additional Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer that guarantee certain Indebtedness of the Issuers or any Subsidiary Guarantor will guarantee the Unsecured Notes, subject to certain exceptions and subject to release and discharge as described in this “Description of Unsecured Notes.” Each of the Guarantees will be: - a general senior unsecured obligation of such Guarantor; - equal in right of payment with any existing and future Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor; 288 ----- - senior in right of payment to any future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Guarantee of such Guarantor; - effectively subordinated to all existing and future Secured Indebtedness of such Guarantor, including the guarantees of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Secured Notes, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such Secured Indebtedness; and - structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness, claims of holders of Preferred Stock and other liabilities of such Guarantor’s Subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Unsecured Notes (other than the Issuers).

The ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement will set forth the relative priority of the Liens securing Pari Passu Obligations and, if applicable, certain future Junior Lien Obligations (the “Non-ABL Obligations”), on the one hand, compared to the Liens securing the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations (collectively, all such Non-ABL Obligations and Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations, the “Applicable Obligations”), on the other hand. Although the holders of Non-ABL Obligations and Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations will not be parties to the ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement, by their acceptance of the instruments evidencing such Obligations, each authorizes their Applicable Collateral Agent to enter into the ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement and each agrees to be bound thereby. The ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement will allocate the benefits of any Collateral between the holders of the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations on the one hand and the holders of the Non-ABL Obligations on the other hand. The ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement will provide, among other things: _Lien Priority. Notwithstanding the time, order or method of grant, creation, attachment or perfection of any_ Liens securing any Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations (the “ABL Liens”), the Liens securing any Non-ABL Obligations (the “Non-ABL Liens”), the defects or deficiencies in any such Liens or other circumstances whatsoever, (1) the ABL Liens on the ABL Priority Collateral securing such Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations will rank senior to any Non-ABL Liens on the ABL Priority Collateral securing such Non-ABL Obligations, and (2) the Non-ABL Liens on the Fixed Asset Priority Collateral securing such Non-ABL Obligations will rank senior to any ABL Liens on the Fixed Asset Priority Collateral securing such Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations. _Prohibition on Contesting Liens and Obligations. No Applicable Collateral Agent with respect to, and no_ holder of, any class of Applicable Obligations may contest or support any other person in contesting the validity, perfection, priority or enforceability of the Liens of any other Applicable Collateral Agent with respect to, or holder of, any other class of Applicable Obligations. _Exercise of Remedies and Release of Liens with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral. Prior to the_ discharge of the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations, the Senior ABL Credit Agreement Collateral Agent will have the sole power to exercise remedies against the ABL Priority Collateral (subject to the right of each Collateral Agent for any series of Pari Passu Obligations to take limited protective measures with respect to the Non-ABL Liens and to take certain actions that would be permitted to be taken by unsecured creditors not otherwise prohibited by the ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement) and to foreclose upon and dispose of the ABL Priority Collateral. Upon any sale of any ABL Priority Collateral in connection with any exercise of remedies with respect to such ABL Priority Collateral that results in the release of the Liens of the Senior ABL Credit Agreement Collateral Agent on such item of ABL Priority Collateral, the Liens of each other class of Applicable Obligations on such item of ABL Priority Collateral will be automatically released. _Exercise of Remedies and Release of Liens with respect to the Fixed Asset Priority Collateral.

In connection with any enforcement action with respect_ to the Collateral or in respect of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, (x)(1) all proceeds of ABL Priority Collateral will first be applied to the repayment of all Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations in accordance with the Senior ABL Credit Agreement, before being applied to any Non-ABL Obligations; and (2) after the discharge of Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations, if any Non-ABL Obligations remain outstanding, all proceeds of ABL Priority Collateral will be applied to the repayment of any outstanding Non-ABL Obligations in accordance with the terms of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement and any other applicable intercreditor agreement; and (y)(1) all proceeds of Fixed Asset Priority Collateral shall be applied to Non-ABL Obligations in accordance with the terms of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement and any other applicable intercreditor agreement, before being applied to the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations; and (2) after the discharge of Non-ABL Obligations, if any Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations remain outstanding, all proceeds of Fixed Asset Priority Collateral will be applied to the repayment of any outstanding Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations in accordance with the Senior ABL Credit Agreement.

In addition, the ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if the Issuer or any Guarantor is subject to a case under the Bankruptcy Code or any other bankruptcy law: (A) if the Senior ABL Credit Agreement Collateral Agent desires to permit the Issuer or any Guarantor to obtain DIP Financing secured by a lien on ABL Priority Collateral to be provided by one or more lenders under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code and/or the use of cash collateral constituting ABL Priority Collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code (or, in each case, under any equivalent provision of any other applicable bankruptcy law), then the Controlling Collateral Agent and the holders of Non-ABL Obligations agree not to object to any such financing or to the Liens on the ABL Priority Collateral securing the same or to any use of such cash collateral that constitutes ABL Priority Collateral, unless the Senior ABL Credit Agreement Collateral Agent shall then oppose or object to such financing or such liens or use of such cash collateral that constitutes ABL Priority Collateral, or to request adequate protection (except as otherwise permitted under the ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement) or any other relief in connection therewith (and (i) to the extent that such DIP Financing liens are senior to the Liens on any such ABL Priority Collateral for the benefit of the Senior ABL Priority Secured Parties, each Pari Passu Secured Party and Junior Lien Secured Party will subordinate 163 ----- its Liens with respect to such ABL Priority Collateral on the same terms as the Liens of the Pari Passu Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any Senior ABL Priority Secured Party constituting DIP financing liens) are subordinated thereto, and (ii) to the extent that such DIP Financing liens rank pari passu with the Liens on any such ABL Priority Collateral granted to secure the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations of the Senior ABL Priority Secured Parties, each Pari Passu Secured Party and Junior Lien Secured Party will confirm the priorities with respect to such ABL Priority Collateral as set forth in the ABL/ Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement), in each case so long as: (1) the Pari Passu Secured Parties and Junior Lien Secured Parties retain the benefit of their Liens on all such ABL Priority Collateral pledged to the DIP Lenders, including proceeds thereof arising after the commencement of such proceeding (other than any Liens constituting DIP Financing Liens) as existed prior to the commencement of such insolvency or liquidation proceeding; (2) the Pari Passu Secured Parties and Junior Lien Secured Parties are granted junior Liens on any additional ABL Priority Collateral pledged to any Senior ABL Priority Secured Party as adequate protection or otherwise in connection with such DIP financing or use of such cash collateral;

and (4) if any Senior ABL Priority Secured Parties are granted adequate protection, including in the form of periodic payments, in connection with such DIP Financing or use of cash collateral, the proceeds of such adequate protection are applied pursuant to the ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement; (B) the Controlling Collateral Agent and the holders of Non-ABL Obligations will not object to and will not otherwise contest (i) any motion for relief from the automatic stay in Section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code or under any equivalent provision of any other applicable bankruptcy law or from any injunction against foreclosure or enforcement in respect of the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations made by the Senior ABL Credit Agreement Collateral Agent or any holder of such Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations, (ii) any lawful exercise by any holder of Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations of the right to credit under Section 363(k) of the Bankruptcy Code or under any equivalent provision of any other applicable bankruptcy to bid Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations in any sale in foreclosure of collateral securing such Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations; (iii) any other request for judicial relief made in any court by any holder of Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations relating to the lawful enforcement of any Lien on the ABL Priority Collateral; (iv) any sale or other disposition of any ABL Priority Collateral (or any portion thereof) under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code or any other provision of the Bankruptcy Code or under any equivalent provision of any other applicable bankruptcy law if the Senior ABL Credit Agreement Collateral Agent or the holders of Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations shall have consented to such sale or disposition of the ABL Priority Collateral; and (v) any order relating to a sale of assets constituting ABL Priority Collateral for which the Senior ABL Credit Agreement Collateral Agent has consented which provides that, to the extent the sale is to be free and clear of Liens, the Liens securing the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations and the Non-ABL Obligations will attach to the proceeds of the sale on the same basis of priority as the Liens securing such Obligations on the assets being sold, in accordance with the ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement; (C) the Controlling Collateral Agent and the holders of Non-ABL Obligations will not seek relief from the automatic stay in Section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code or under any equivalent provision of any other applicable bankruptcy law or any other stay in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral without the prior consent of the Senior ABL Credit Agreement Collateral Agent or oppose any request by the Senior ABL Credit Agreement Collateral Agent for relief from such stay with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral Agent and the holders of Non-ABL Obligations will not object to and will not otherwise contest (or support any other person contesting) (a) any request 164 ----- by the Senior ABL Credit Agreement Collateral Agent or the holders of Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations for adequate protection with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral or (b) any objection by the Senior ABL Credit Agreement Collateral Agent or the holders of Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations to any motion, relief, action or proceeding based on the Senior ABL Credit Agreement Collateral Agent or the holders of Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations claiming a lack of adequate protection with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, (i) if the holders of Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations (or any subset thereof) are granted adequate protection with respect to ABL Priority Collateral in the form of additional collateral in connection with any DIP Financing or use of cash collateral under Section 363 or Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or under any equivalent provision of any other applicable Bankruptcy Law, then each Collateral Agent for any series of Pari Passu Obligations may seek or request adequate protection in the form of a replacement Lien on such additional collateral, so long as such Lien is subordinated to the Liens on the ABL Priority Collateral securing the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations and such DIP Financing (and all Obligations relating thereto), on the same basis as the other Liens on ABL Priority Collateral securing the Non-ABL Obligations are subordinated to the Liens on ABL Priority Collateral securing the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations under the ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement and (ii) in the event a Collateral Agent for any series of Pari Passu Obligations seeks or requests adequate protection and such adequate protection is granted in the form of additional collateral, then the Controlling Collateral Agent and the holders of Non-ABL Obligations agree that the holders of the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations shall also be granted a Lien on such additional collateral as security for the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations and any such DIP Financing and that any Lien on such additional collateral that constitutes ABL Priority Collateral securing the Non-ABL Obligations shall be subordinated to the Liens on such collateral securing the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations and any such DIP Financing (and all Obligations relating thereto) and any other Liens on ABL Priority Collateral granted to the holders of Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations as adequate protection on the same basis as the Non-ABL Liens are so subordinated to the Liens securing the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations under the ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement; and (D) no non-Senior ABL Credit Agreement Collateral Agent nor any other Pari Passu Secured Party or Junior Lien Secured Party shall (i) oppose or seek to challenge any claim by the Senior ABL Credit Agreement Collateral Agent or any holder of Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations for allowance of Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations consisting of post-petition interest, fees or expenses to the extent of the value of the Senior ABL Credit Agreement Collateral Agent’s Lien on the ABL Priority Collateral, without regard to the existence of the Lien of the Pari Passu Secured Parties and Junior Lien Secured Parties on the ABL Priority Collateral or (ii) until the discharge of Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations has occurred, assert or enforce any claim under Section 506(c) of the Bankruptcy Code or under any equivalent provision of any other applicable Bankruptcy Law senior or on parity with the Liens on the ABL Priority Collateral securing the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations for costs or expenses of preserving or disposing of any Collateral. The ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the provisions of it are intended to be and shall be enforceable under Section 510(a) of the Bankruptcy Code or under any equivalent provision of any other applicable Bankruptcy Law. The ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement will also contain similar reciprocal restrictions on the Senior ABL Credit Agreement Collateral Agent and the holders of Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations applicable during an insolvency or liquidation proceeding. The ABL/Fixed Asset Intercreditor Agreement will also provide for customary access and use of the Fixed Asset Priority Collateral for purposes of exercising remedies with respect to the ABL Priority Collateral, and that the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Obligations and the Non-ABL Obligations shall be deemed separate classes of secured obligations. 165 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,482

To the extent that the Pari Passu Secured Parties are granted adequate protection in the form of payments in the amount of current post-petition fees and expenses, and/or other cash payments, then the Junior Lien Representatives shall not be prohibited from seeking adequate protection in the form of payments in the amount of current post-petition incurred fees and expenses, and/or other cash payments (as applicable), subject to the right of the Pari Passu Secured Parties to object to the reasonableness of the amounts of fees and expenses or other cash payments so sought by the Junior Lien Secured Parties.

Each Junior Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of each applicable Junior Lien Secured Party, will acknowledge and agree that (a) the grants of Liens securing the Pari Passu Obligations and the Junior Lien Obligations constitute separate and distinct grants of Liens and (b) because of, among other things, their differing rights in the Collateral, the Junior Lien Obligations are fundamentally different from the Pari Passu Obligations and must be separately classified in any plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan proposed, confirmed or adopted in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding. To further effectuate the intent of the parties as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, if it is held that the claims of the Pari Passu Secured Parties and the Junior Lien Secured Parties in respect of the Collateral constitute only one secured claim (rather than separate classes of senior and junior secured claims) under a plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan, then each Junior Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of the applicable Junior Lien Secured Parties, will acknowledge and agree that all distributions from the Collateral shall be made as if there were separate classes of senior and junior secured claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors in respect of the Collateral (with the effect being that, to the extent that the aggregate value of the Collateral is sufficient (for this purpose ignoring all claims held by the Junior Lien Secured Parties), the Pari Passu Secured Parties shall be entitled to receive, in addition to amounts distributed to them in respect of principal, pre-petition interest and other claims, all amounts owing in respect of post-petition interest, fees, and expenses (whether or not allowed or allowable in such insolvency or liquidation proceeding) before any distribution is made from the Collateral in respect of the Junior Lien Obligations, with each Junior Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of each applicable Junior Lien Secured Party, acknowledging and agreeing to turn over to the Controlling Collateral Agent amounts otherwise received or receivable by them from the Collateral to the extent necessary to effectuate the intent of this sentence, even if such turnover has the effect of reducing the claim or recovery of the Junior Lien Secured Parties. 170 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,482

The amount to be received upon a sale of the Collateral would also be dependent on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the actual fair market value of the Collateral at such time and the timing and the manner of the sale. By their nature, portions of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral can be sold in a short period of time or in an orderly manner. In addition, as discussed further below, the Holders of the Secured Notes will not be entitled to receive post-petition interest or applicable fees, costs, expenses, or charges to the extent the amount of the obligations due under the Secured Notes exceeds the value of the Collateral (after taking into account all other first- priority debt that is also secured by the Collateral), or any “adequate protection” on account of any undersecured portion of the Secured Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,482

Upon the commencement of a case for relief under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor such as the Notes Collateral Agent is prohibited from foreclosing upon or repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of previously repossessed security without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances). In view of the broad equitable powers of a U.S. bankruptcy court and the lack of a precise definition of the meaning of “adequate protection,” it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under the Secured Notes could be made following the commencement of a bankruptcy case (or the length of the delay in making any such payments), whether or when the Notes Collateral Agent could or would repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value of the Collateral at any time during a bankruptcy case or whether or to what extent Holders of the Secured Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code permits the payment and/or accrual of post-petition interest, expenses, costs and attorneys’ fees to a secured creditor during a debtor’s bankruptcy case only to the extent the value of such creditor’s interest in the Collateral is determined by the bankruptcy court to exceed the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the obligations secured by the Collateral. Furthermore, in the event a domestic or foreign bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Secured Notes, the Holders of the Secured Notes would hold secured claims only to the extent of the value of the Collateral to which the Holders of the Secured Notes are entitled, and unsecured “deficiency” claims with respect to such shortfall, which deficiency claims would not need to be adequately protected during a bankruptcy case.",N/A,as_expected,2021,482

Within 60 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuers will send (or cause to be sent) notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Secured Notes to the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, with the following information: (1) that a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the covenant entitled “Change of Control Triggering Event,” and that all Secured Notes properly tendered pursuant to such Change of Control Offer will be accepted for payment by the Issuer; (2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is sent (the “Change of Control Payment Date”), except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event as described below; (3) that any Secured Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest; (4) that unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Secured Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date; (5) that Holders electing to have any Secured Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender such Secured Notes, with the form entitled “Option of Holder to Elect Purchase” on the reverse of such Secured Notes completed or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, to the paying agent specified in the notice at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date; (6) that Holders whose Secured Notes are being purchased only in part will be issued new Secured Notes and such new Secured Notes will be equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Secured Notes surrendered.

While the Secured Notes are in global form and the Issuers makes an offer to purchase all of the Secured Notes pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, a Holder may exercise its option to elect for the purchase of the Secured Notes or withdraw such election through the facilities of DTC, subject to its rules and regulations. The Issuers will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of Secured Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Secured Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached their obligations described in the Secured Indenture by virtue thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuers will, to the extent permitted by law: (1) accept for payment all Secured Notes issued by it or portions thereof validly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment in respect of all Secured Notes or portions thereof so tendered and not validly withdrawn; and (3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation the Secured Notes so accepted together with an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that such Secured Notes or portions thereof have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuers. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities will provide, and future credit agreements or other agreements relating to Indebtedness to which the Issuer (or one of its Affiliates) becomes a party may provide, that certain change of control events with respect to the Issuer would constitute a default thereunder (including a Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Secured Indenture). In addition, the Unsecured Notes will contain a change of control provision similar to the provisions described in this “—Change of Control Triggering Event” section. If we experience a change of control event that triggers a default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or any such future Indebtedness or results in a requirement to offer to repurchase the Unsecured Notes, we could seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Unsecured Notes and/or such future Indebtedness. In the event we do not obtain such a waiver or do not refinance the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Unsecured Notes and/or such future Indebtedness, such default or failure to 178 ----- repurchase any tendered Unsecured Notes could result in amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Unsecured Notes or such future Indebtedness being declared due and payable and/or cause a Securitization Facility or other financing arrangements to be wound down. Our ability to pay cash to the Holders of Secured Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature of the Secured Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. We have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Secured Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and, in the case of Secured Indebtedness, “—Certain Covenants—Liens.” Such restrictions in the Secured Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Required Holders. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Secured Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the Secured Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Issuers will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control Triggering Event if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Secured Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuers and purchases all Secured Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) in connection with or in contemplation of any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuers (or any Affiliate of the Issuers) have made an offer to purchase (an “Alternate Offer”) any and all Secured Notes validly tendered at a cash price equal to or higher than the Change of Control Payment and has purchased all Secured Notes properly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Alternate Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event, conditional upon such Change of Control Triggering Event, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer. A Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Secured Indenture, Secured Notes, Guarantees and/or Security Documents (but the Change of Control Offer and the Alternate Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents). The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuers to make an offer to repurchase the Secured Notes as described above. The provisions under the Secured Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event, including the definition of “Change of The Unsecured Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs after the Completion Date, unless the Issuer has previously or concurrently sent a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Unsecured Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption,” the Issuers will make an offer to purchase all of the Unsecured Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a price in cash (the “Change of Control Payment”) equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase, subject to the right of Holders of the Unsecured Notes of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the purchase date. Within 60 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuers will send (or cause to be sent) notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Unsecured Notes to the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, with the following information: (1) that a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the covenant entitled “Change of Control Triggering Event,” and that all Unsecured Notes properly tendered pursuant to such Change of Control Offer will be accepted for payment by the Issuer; (2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is sent (the “Change of Control Payment Date”), except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event as described below; (3) that any Unsecured Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest; (4) that unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Unsecured Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date; (5) that Holders electing to have any Unsecured Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender such Unsecured Notes, with the form entitled “Option of Holder to Elect Purchase” on the reverse of such Unsecured Notes completed or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, to the paying agent specified in the notice at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date; (6) that Holders whose Unsecured Notes are being purchased only in part will be issued new Unsecured Notes and such new Unsecured Notes will be equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Unsecured Notes surrendered. The unpurchased portion of the Unsecured Notes must be equal to at least $2,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof; (7) if such notice is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control Triggering Event and shall describe each such condition, and, if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the notice is sent) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied or waived, or that such repurchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied or waived by the Change of Control Payment Date, or by the Change of Control Payment Date as so delayed, or such notice or offer may be rescinded at any time in the Issuer’s sole discretion if the Issuer determines that any or all of such conditions will not be satisfied or waived; (8) any other instructions, as determined by the Issuer, consistent with this Change of Control Triggering Event covenant, that a Holder must follow; and 297 ----- (9) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Unsecured Notes and their election to require the Issuers to purchase such Unsecured Notes; provided that the paying agent receives, not later than the close of business on the tenth Business Day prior to the expiration date of the Change of Control Offer, a facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the holder of the Unsecured Notes, the principal amount of Unsecured Notes tendered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its tendered Unsecured Notes, or a specified portion thereof, and its election to have such Unsecured Notes purchased. While the Unsecured Notes are in global form and the Issuers makes an offer to purchase all of the Unsecured Notes pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, a Holder may exercise its option to elect for the purchase of the Unsecured Notes or withdraw such election through the facilities of DTC, subject to its rules and regulations. The Issuers will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of Unsecured Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Unsecured Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached their obligations described in the Unsecured Indenture by virtue thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuers will, to the extent permitted by law: (1) accept for payment all Unsecured Notes issued by it or portions thereof validly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment in respect of all Unsecured Notes or portions thereof so tendered and not validly withdrawn; and (3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation the Unsecured Notes so accepted together with an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that such Unsecured Notes or portions thereof have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuers. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities will provide, and future credit agreements or other agreements relating to Indebtedness to which the Issuer (or one of its Affiliates) becomes a party may provide, that certain change of control events with respect to the Issuer would constitute a default thereunder (including a Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Unsecured Indenture). In addition, the Secured Notes will contain a change of control provision similar to the provisions described in this “—Change of Control Triggering Event” section. If we experience a change of control event that triggers a default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or any such future Indebtedness or results in a requirement to offer to repurchase the Secured Notes, we could seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Secured Notes and/or such future Indebtedness. In the event we do not obtain such a waiver or do not refinance the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Secured Notes and/or such future Indebtedness, such default or failure to repurchase any tendered Secured Notes could result in amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Secured Notes or such future Indebtedness being declared due and payable and/or cause a Securitization Facility or other financing arrangements to be wound down. Our ability to pay cash to the Holders of Unsecured Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature of the Unsecured Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent 298 ----- management. We have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Unsecured Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and, in the case of Secured Indebtedness, “—Certain Covenants—Liens.” Such restrictions in the Unsecured Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Required Holders. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Unsecured Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the Unsecured Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Issuers will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control Triggering Event if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Unsecured Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuers and purchases all Unsecured Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) in connection with or in contemplation of any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuers (or any Affiliate of the Issuers) have made an offer to purchase (an “Alternate Offer”) any and all Unsecured Notes validly tendered at a cash price equal to or higher than the Change of Control Payment and has purchased all Unsecured Notes properly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Alternate Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event, conditional upon such Change of Control Triggering Event, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer. A Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Unsecured Indenture, Unsecured Notes and/or Guarantees (but the Change of Control Offer and the Alternate Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents). The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuers to make an offer to repurchase the Unsecured Notes as described above.

The non-application of any prepayment amounts as a consequence of the foregoing provisions will not, for the avoidance of doubt, constitute a Default or an Event of Default. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the Secured Indenture shall be construed to require the Issuer or any Subsidiary to repatriate cash. Any Applicable Proceeds (other than any amounts excluded from this covenant as set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph) that are not invested or applied as provided and within the time period set forth in the second preceding paragraph in excess of the Excess Proceeds Threshold will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds”; provided that any amount of Applicable Proceeds offered to Holders of the Secured Notes pursuant to clause (1)(b) of the second preceding paragraph shall not be deemed to be Excess Proceeds without regard to whether such offer is accepted by any Holders and any amount of Applicable Proceeds offered to Holders pursuant to clause (1)(b) of the second preceding paragraph that are not accepted shall be deemed to be Declined Proceeds. When the aggregate amount of such Applicable Proceeds exceeds the greater of (i) $720.0 million and (ii) 30.0% of LTM EBITDA in any fiscal year (the “Excess Proceeds Threshold”), the Issuer shall make an offer (an “Asset Sale Offer”) to all Holders of the Secured Notes and, if required or permitted by the terms of any other Pari Passu Obligations or Obligations secured by a Lien permitted under the Secured Indenture on the Collateral disposed of, to the holders of such other Pari Passu Obligations or other Obligations, to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of the Secured Notes and such other Pari Passu Obligations or other Obligations that is, with respect to the Secured Notes only, in an amount equal to $1,000, or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof, that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price, in the case of the Secured Notes, in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof (or accreted value thereof, if less), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Secured Indenture, and in the case of such other Pari Passu Obligations or other Obligations, at the offer price required by the terms thereof, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the agreement(s) governing such other Pari Passu Obligations or other Obligations. The Issuers will commence an Asset Sale 182 ----- Offer with respect to such Excess Proceeds within 20 Business Days after the date that Excess Proceeds exceed the Excess Proceeds Threshold by delivering to the Holders the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Secured Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee. The Issuers may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Applicable Proceeds by making an Asset Sale Offer with respect to such Applicable Proceeds prior to the time period that may be required by the Secured Indenture with respect to all or a part of the available Applicable Proceeds (the “Advance Portion”) in advance of being required to do so by the Secured Indenture (an “Advance",N/A,as_expected,2021,482

If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Secured Notes or such other Pari Passu Obligations or other Obligations, as the case may be, surrendered by such holders thereof exceeds the amount offered in the Asset Sale Offer (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuers shall purchase the Secured Notes (subject to applicable DTC procedures as to global notes) and such other Pari Passu Obligations or other Obligations, as the case may be, on a pro rata basis based on the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of the Secured Notes or such other Pari Passu Obligations or other Obligations, as the case may be, tendered with adjustments as necessary so that no Secured Notes or such other Pari Passu Obligations or other Obligations, as the case may be, will be repurchased in part in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer (or Advance Offer), the amount of Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) that resulted in the requirement to make an Asset Sale Offer shall be reset to zero (regardless of whether there are any remaining Excess Proceeds (or Advance Portion) upon such completion). Additionally, the Issuers may, at their option, make an Asset Sale Offer using Applicable Proceeds at any time after the consummation of such Asset Sale. Upon consummation or expiration of any Asset Sale Offer (or Advance Offer), any remaining Applicable Proceeds shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Issuers may use such Applicable Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited under the Secured Indenture. An Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Secured Indenture, Secured Notes, Guarantees and/or Security Documents (but the Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents). Pending the final application of the amount of any Applicable Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness, or otherwise use such Applicable Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Secured Indenture. The Issuers will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Secured Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer or an Advance Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Secured Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Secured Indenture by virtue thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. The provisions under the Secured Indenture relative to the Issuers’ obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Secured Notes as a result of an Asset Sale may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Required Holders. 183 ----- The Senior Secured Credit Facilities will contain, and future credit agreements or other similar agreements to which the Issuers become a party may contain restrictions on the Issuer’s ability to repurchase Secured Notes. In the event an Asset Sale occurs at a time when the Issuers are prohibited from purchasing Secured Notes, the Issuers could seek the consent of its lenders to the repurchase of Secured Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuers do not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the Issuers will remain prohibited from repurchasing Secured Notes. In such a case, the Issuers’ failure to repurchase tendered Secured Notes would constitute a Default under the Secured Indenture which would, in turn, likely constitute a default under such other agreements.",N/A,as_expected,2021,482

_provided further that if any Second Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such_ Applicable Proceeds are applied, then such Applicable Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds.

The non-application of any prepayment amounts as a consequence of the foregoing provisions will not, for the avoidance of doubt, constitute a Default or an Event of Default. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the Unsecured Indenture shall be construed to require the Issuer or any Subsidiary to repatriate cash. Any Applicable Proceeds (other than any amounts excluded from this covenant as set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph) that are not invested or applied as provided and within the time period set forth in the second preceding paragraph in excess of the Excess Proceeds Threshold will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds”; provided that any amount of Applicable Proceeds offered to Holders of the Unsecured Notes pursuant to clause (1)(c) of the second preceding paragraph shall not be deemed to be Excess Proceeds without regard to whether such offer is accepted by any Holders and any amount of Applicable Proceeds offered to Holders pursuant to clause (1)(c) of the second preceding paragraph that are not accepted shall be deemed to be Declined Proceeds. When the aggregate amount of such Applicable Proceeds exceeds the greater of (i) $720.0 million and (ii) 30.0% of LTM EBITDA in any fiscal year (the “Excess Proceeds Threshold”), the Issuer shall make an offer (an “Asset Sale Offer”) to all Holders of the Unsecured Notes and, if required or permitted by the terms of any Indebtedness that ranks pari passu in right of payment with the Notes (“Pari Passu",N/A,as_expected,2021,482

The Issuers will commence an Asset Sale Offer with respect to such Excess Proceeds within 20 Business Days after the date that Excess Proceeds exceed the Excess Proceeds Threshold by delivering to the Holders the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Unsecured Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee. The Issuers may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Applicable Proceeds 302 ----- by making an Asset Sale Offer with respect to such Applicable Proceeds prior to the time period that may be required by the Unsecured Indenture with respect to all or a part of the available Applicable Proceeds (the “Advance Portion”) in advance of being required to do so by the Unsecured Indenture (an “Advance Offer”). To the extent that the aggregate amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Unsecured Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the amount offered in the Asset Sale Offer (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuers may use any remaining Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) (“Declined Proceeds”) for any purposes not otherwise prohibited under the Unsecured Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Unsecured Notes or such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, surrendered by such holders thereof exceeds the amount offered in the Asset Sale Offer (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuers shall purchase the Unsecured Notes (subject to applicable DTC procedures as to global notes) and such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, on a pro rata basis based on the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of the Unsecured Notes or such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, tendered with adjustments as necessary so that no Unsecured Notes or such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, will be repurchased in part in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer (or Advance Offer), the amount of Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) that resulted in the requirement to make an Asset Sale Offer shall be reset to zero (regardless of whether there are any remaining Excess Proceeds (or Advance Portion) upon such completion). Additionally, the Issuers may, at their option, make an Asset Sale Offer using Applicable Proceeds at any time after the consummation of such Asset Sale. Upon consummation or expiration of any Asset Sale Offer (or Advance Offer), any remaining Applicable Proceeds shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Issuers may use such Applicable Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited under the Unsecured Indenture. An Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Unsecured Indenture, Unsecured Notes and/or Guarantees (but the Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents). Pending the final application of the amount of any Applicable Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness, or otherwise use such Applicable Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Unsecured Indenture. The Issuers will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Unsecured Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer or an Advance Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Unsecured Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Unsecured Indenture by virtue thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. The provisions under the Unsecured Indenture relative to the Issuers’ obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Unsecured Notes as a result of an Asset Sale may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Required Holders. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities will contain, and future credit agreements or other similar agreements to which the Issuers become a party may contain restrictions on the Issuer’s ability to repurchase Unsecured Notes. In the event an Asset Sale occurs at a time when the Issuers are prohibited from purchasing Unsecured Notes, the Issuers could seek the consent of its lenders to the repurchase of Unsecured Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuers do not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the Issuers will remain prohibited from repurchasing Unsecured Notes. In such a case, the Issuers’ 303 ----- failure to repurchase tendered Unsecured Notes would constitute a Default under the Unsecured Indenture which would, in turn, likely constitute a default under such other agreements.",N/A,as_expected,2021,482

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a proposed Restricted Payment (or a portion thereof) meets the criteria of clauses (1) through (24) above and/or one or more of the clauses contained in the definition of “Permitted Investments,” or is entitled to be made pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer will be entitled to divide or classify or later divide or reclassify (based on circumstances existing on the date of such reclassification) such Restricted Payment (or a portion thereof) between such clauses (1) through (24) and such first paragraph and/or one or more of the clauses contained in the definition of “Permitted Investments,” in any manner that otherwise complies with this covenant.

Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants set forth in the Secured Indenture. For the avoidance of doubt, this covenant shall not restrict the making of any “AHYDO catch-up payment” with respect to, and required by the terms of, any Indebtedness of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries permitted to be incurred under the terms of the Secured Indenture.

(IV) make any payment (whether of principal, interest or other amounts) on or with respect to, or purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value, any Material Subordinated Shareholder Funding (other than any payment of interest thereon in the form of additional Subordinated Shareholder Funding);

Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants set forth in the Unsecured Indenture. 318 ----- For the avoidance of doubt, this covenant shall not restrict the making of any “AHYDO catch-up payment” with respect to, and required by the terms of, any Indebtedness of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries permitted to be incurred under the terms of the Unsecured Indenture.

The principal amount or liquidation preference of any Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, if incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such respective Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. The Secured Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured or (2) Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other Indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral or because it is secured by different collateral or issued or guaranteed by other obligors.

If Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock originally incurred in reliance upon a percentage of LTM EBITDA under this covenant is being refinanced and such refinancing would cause the maximum amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock thereunder to be exceeded at such time, then such refinancing will nevertheless be permitted thereunder and such additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock will be deemed to have been incurred under the applicable provision so long as the principal amount or liquidation preference of such refinancing Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock does not exceed the principal amount or liquidation preference of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock being refinanced plus amounts permitted by the next sentence. Any Refinancing Indebtedness and any Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock permitted to be incurred under the Unsecured Indenture to refinance Indebtedness incurred pursuant to clauses (1)-(38) above shall be deemed to include additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock incurred to pay accrued but unpaid interest or dividends, premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting or initial purchaser discounts, fees, costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) in connection with such refinancing. For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, the U.S. Dollar Equivalent principal amount or liquidation preference of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock was, at the option of Parent, first committed or first incurred or upon execution of the definitive documentation in respect thereof; provided that if such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar 327 ----- denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount or liquidation preference of such refinancing Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock does not exceed (a) the principal amount or liquidation preference of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock being refinanced plus (b) the aggregate amount of accrued but unpaid interest, fees, underwriting or initial purchaser discounts, premiums (including tender premiums) and other costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) incurred in connection with such refinancing. The principal amount or liquidation preference of any Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, if incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such respective Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. The Unsecured Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured or (2) Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other Indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral or because it is secured by different collateral or issued or guaranteed by other obligors.",N/A,as_expected,2021,482

In addition, each Directing Holder is deemed, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, to covenant to provide the Issuer with such other information as the Issuer may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Directing Holder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is DTC or DTC’s nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Secured Notes in lieu of DTC or DTC’s nominee and DTC shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Position Representation and Verification Covenant in delivering its direction to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Secured Notes, the Issuer determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and the Issuer provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate 221 ----- certifying that the Issuer has (i) a good faith reasonable basis to believe that one or more Directing Holders were at any relevant time in breach of their Position Representation or their Verification Covenant and (ii) initiated proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holders were, at such time, in breach of their Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending a final and nonappealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If such Officer’s Certificate has been delivered to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall refrain from acting in accordance with such Noteholder Direction until such time as the Issuer provides to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, an Officer’s Certificate stating that (i) such Directing Holders have satisfied their Verification Covenant or (ii) such Directing Holders have failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, and during such time the cure period with respect to any Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Directing Holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Directing Holder, the percentage of Secured Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio (other than any indemnity such Holder may have offered or provided to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent), with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, and any related acceleration rescinded, and the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such alleged Default or Event of Default, shall not be permitted to act thereon and shall be restricted from accepting and acting on any future Noteholder Direction in relation to such Event of Default. If the Directing Holder has satisfied its Verification Covenant, then the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, shall be permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder Direction. Notwithstanding the above, if such Directing Holder’s participation is not required to achieve the requisite level of consent of Holders required under the Secured Indenture to give such Noteholder Direction, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, shall be permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder Direction notwithstanding any action taken or to be taken by the Issuer (as described above). Each of the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction or Officer’s Certificate delivered to it in accordance with the Secured Indenture without verification, investigation or otherwise as to the statements made therein. Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction delivered to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraphs. In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing paragraphs shall not apply to any Holder that is a Regulated Bank. Each Holder by accepting a Secured Note acknowledges and agrees that neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent (nor any agent) shall not be liable to any person for acting or refraining to act in accordance with (i) the foregoing provisions, (ii) any Noteholder Direction, (iii) any Officer’s Certificate or (iv) its duties under the Secured Indenture, as the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, may determine in its sole discretion. Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent shall have any obligation (i) to monitor, investigate, verify or otherwise determine if a Holder has a Net Short position, (ii) investigate the accuracy or authenticity of any Position Representation, (iii) inquire if the Issuer will seek action to determine if a Directing Holder has breached its Position Representation, (iv) enforce any Verification Covenant, (v) monitor any court proceedings undertaken in connection therewith, (vi) monitor or investigate whether any Default or Event of Default has been publicly reported or (vii) otherwise make any calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to any Derivative Instruments, Net Short position, Long Derivative Instrument, Short Derivative Instrument or otherwise. Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, or in the case of clauses (3), (4), (5), (7), (8) or (9) of the first paragraph of this section, upon a valid Noteholder Direction, to accelerate the Secured Notes, such principal of 222 ----- and premium, if any, and interest will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising under clause (6) of the first paragraph of this section, all outstanding Secured Notes will become due and payable without further action or notice. The Secured Indenture will provide that the Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice of any continuing Default, except a Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest. The Secured Indenture will provide, subject to the foregoing, that the Required Holders, by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Secured Notes waive any existing Default and its consequences under the Secured Indenture or the Security Documents and rescind any acceleration with respect to the Secured Notes and its consequences (except if such rescission would conflict with any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction and except a continuing Default in the payment of interest on, premium, if any, or the principal of, any Secured Note held by a non-consenting Holder). In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (4) of the first paragraph of this section, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment default, other than as a result of acceleration of the Secured Notes) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the Holders, if within 30 days after such Event of Default arose: (1) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged; (2) the requisite number of holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or (3) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured. In case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent will be under any obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Secured Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders of the Secured Notes unless the Holders have offered and, if requested, provided to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due on or after the respective due dates expressed in an outstanding Secured Note, no Holder of a Secured Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the Secured Indenture or the Secured Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing and, if such Event of Default is in respect of clause (3), (4), (5), (7), (8) or (9) of the first paragraph of this section, such Holder is not in breach of a Position Representation or Verification Covenant; (2) the Holders, or in the case of clauses (3), (4), (5), (7) (8) or (9) of the first paragraph of this section, Directing Holders that are not in breach of a Position Representation or Verification Covenant, comprising at least 30% in the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Secured Notes have requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) Holders of the Secured Notes have offered, and if requested, provided the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt thereof and the offer of security or indemnity; and (5) the Required Holders have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such written request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions contained in the Secured Indenture, including those described above, the Required Holders are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Secured Indenture or that the Trustee 223 ----- determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder of a Secured Note or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability, and may take any other action that is not inconsistent with any such direction received from Holders of the Secured Notes (it being understood that the Trustee does not have an affirmative duty to determine whether any action is prejudicial to any Holder). The Secured Indenture will provide that the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Secured Indenture, and the Issuer is required, within 20 Business Days upon becoming aware of any Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default (unless such Default has been cured or waived within such 20-Business Day time period). The Trustee will not be deemed to have knowledge of any Defaults or Events of Default unless written notice of an event, which is in fact a Default, has been delivered to the Trustee at its office specified in the Indenture and such notice references the Notes and the Indenture and states that it is a “Notice of Default.” Any Default or Event of Default resulting from the failure to deliver a notice, report or certificate under the Secured Indenture shall cease to exist and be cured in all respects if the underlying Default or Event of Default giving rise to such notice, report or certificate requirement shall have ceased to exist and/or be cured (including pursuant to this paragraph). For the avoidance of doubt, each of the parties hereto agree that any court of competent jurisdiction may (x) extend or stay any grace period set forth in the Secured Indenture prior to when any actual or alleged Default becomes an actual or alleged Event of Default or (y) stay the exercise of remedies by the Trustee or Holders contemplated by the Secured Indenture or otherwise upon the occurrence of an actual or alleged Event of Default, in each case of clauses (x) and (y), in accordance with the requirements of applicable law. The Unsecured Indenture will provide that each of the following is an “Event of Default”: (1) default in payment when due and payable, upon redemption, acceleration or otherwise, of principal of, or premium, if any, on the Unsecured Notes; (2) default for 30 days or more in the payment when due of interest on or with respect to the Unsecured Notes; (3) failure by the Issuer or any Guarantor for 60 days after receipt of written notice given by the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Unsecured Notes to comply with any of its obligations, covenants or agreements (other than a default referred to in clause (1) or (2) above) contained in the Unsecured Indenture or the Unsecured Notes; (4) (i) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there is issued or by which there is secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists or is created after the issuance of the Unsecured Notes, if both: (a) such default either results from the failure to pay any principal of such Indebtedness at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or relates to an obligation other than the obligation to pay principal of any such Indebtedness at its stated final maturity and results in the holder or holders of such Indebtedness causing such Indebtedness to become due prior to its stated maturity; and (b) the principal amount of such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness in default for failure to pay principal at stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods), or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregate the greater of (i) $1,000.0 million (or its foreign currency equivalent) and (ii) 40.0% of LTM EBITDA or more outstanding;

and (8) the failure by the Issuer to consummate the Special Mandatory Redemption to the extent required, as described under “—Escrow of Gross Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.” If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clause (6) above) occurs and is continuing under the Unsecured Indenture, the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 30% in aggregate principal amount of all the then outstanding Unsecured Notes may declare the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding Unsecured Notes to be due and payable immediately; provided that no such declaration may be made with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to Holders, more than two years prior to such declaration. Any notice of Default under clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7) of the first paragraph of this section, notice of acceleration with respect to an Event of Default under clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7) of the first paragraph of this section, instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default under clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7) of the first paragraph of this section, notice of acceleration with respect to an Event of Default under clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7) of the first paragraph of this section or instruction to the Trustee to take any other action with respect to an alleged Default or Event of Default under clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7) of the first paragraph of this section (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders (other than a Regulated Bank) (each, a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such Holder delivered to the Issuer and the Trustee that (i) such Holder is not (or, in the case such Holder is DTC or DTC’s nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that are not) Net Short and (ii) such Holder and the Affiliates of such Holder do not (or, in the case such Holder is DTC or DTC’s nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners and Affiliates of such beneficial owners that do not) hold or beneficially own Notes in excess of the Voting Cap (each, a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to delivery of a notice of Default shall be deemed a continuing representation until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Unsecured Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder is deemed, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, to covenant to provide the Issuer with such other information as the Issuer may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Directing Holder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is DTC or DTC’s nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Unsecured Notes in lieu of DTC or DTC’s nominee and DTC shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Position Representation and Verification Covenant in delivering its direction to the Trustee. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Unsecured Notes, the Issuer determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and the Issuer provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate certifying that the Issuer has (i) a good faith reasonable basis to believe that one or more Directing Holders were at any relevant time in breach of their Position Representation or their Verification Covenant and (ii) initiated proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holders were, at such time, in breach of their Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending a final and nonappealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If such Officer’s Certificate has been delivered to the Trustee, the Trustee shall refrain from acting in accordance with such Noteholder Direction until such time as the Issuer provides to the Trustee an Officer’s 341 ----- Certificate stating that (i) such Directing Holders have satisfied their Verification Covenant or (ii) such Directing Holders have failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, and during such time the cure period with respect to any Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Directing Holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Directing Holder, the percentage of Unsecured Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio (other than any indemnity such Holder may have offered or provided to the Trustee), with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, and any related acceleration rescinded, and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such alleged Default or Event of Default, shall not be permitted to act thereon and shall be restricted from accepting and acting on any future Noteholder Direction in relation to such Event of Default. If the Directing Holder has satisfied its Verification Covenant, then the Trustee shall be permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder Direction. Notwithstanding the above, if such Directing Holder’s participation is not required to achieve the requisite level of consent of Holders required under the Unsecured Indenture to give such Noteholder Direction, the Trustee shall be permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder Direction notwithstanding any action taken or to be taken by the Issuer (as described above). Each of the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction or Officer’s Certificate delivered to it in accordance with the Unsecured Indenture without verification, investigation or otherwise as to the statements made therein. Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction delivered to the Trustee during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraphs. In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing paragraphs shall not apply to any Holder that is a Regulated Bank. Each Holder by accepting an Unsecured Note acknowledges and agrees that the Trustee shall not be liable to any person for acting or refraining to act in accordance with (i) the foregoing provisions, (ii) any Noteholder Direction, (iii) any Officer’s Certificate or (iv) its duties under the Unsecured Indenture, as the Trustee may determine in its sole discretion. The Trustee shall not have any obligation (i) to monitor, investigate, verify or otherwise determine if a Holder has a Net Short position, (ii) investigate the accuracy or authenticity of any Position Representation, (iii) inquire if the Issuer will seek action to determine if a Directing Holder has breached its Position Representation, (iv) enforce any Verification Covenant, (v) monitor any court proceedings undertaken in connection therewith, (vi) monitor or investigate whether any Default or Event of Default has been publicly reported or (vii) otherwise make any calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to any Derivative Instruments, Net Short position, Long Derivative Instrument, Short Derivative Instrument or otherwise. Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, or in the case of clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7) of the first paragraph of this section, upon a valid Noteholder Direction, to accelerate the Unsecured Notes, such principal of and premium, if any, and interest will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising under clause (6) of the first paragraph of this section, all outstanding Unsecured Notes will become due and payable without further action or notice. The Unsecured Indenture will provide that the Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice of any continuing Default, except a Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest. The Unsecured Indenture will provide, subject to the foregoing, that the Required Holders, by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Unsecured Notes waive any existing Default and its consequences under the Unsecured Indenture and rescind any acceleration with respect to the Unsecured Notes and its consequences (except if such rescission would conflict with any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction and except a continuing Default in the payment of interest on, premium, if any, or the principal of, any Unsecured Note held by a non-consenting Holder). 342 ----- In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (4) of the first paragraph of this section, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment default, other than as a result of acceleration of the Unsecured Notes) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the Holders, if within 30 days after such Event of Default arose: (1) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged; (2) the requisite number of holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or (3) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured. In case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will not be under any obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Unsecured Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders of the Unsecured Notes unless the Holders have offered and, if requested, provided to the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due on or after the respective due dates expressed in an outstanding Unsecured Note, no Holder of an Unsecured Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the Unsecured Indenture or the Unsecured Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing and, if such Event of Default is in respect of clause (3), (4), (5) or (7) of the first paragraph of this section, such Holder is not in breach of a Position Representation or Verification Covenant; (2) the Holders, or in the case of clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7) of the first paragraph of this section, Directing Holders that are not in breach of a Position Representation or Verification Covenant, comprising at least 30% in the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Unsecured Notes have requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) Holders of the Unsecured Notes have offered, and if requested, provided the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt thereof and the offer of security or indemnity; and (5) the Required Holders have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such written request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions contained in the Unsecured Indenture, including those described above, the Required Holders are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Unsecured Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder of an Unsecured Note or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability, and may take any other action that is not inconsistent with any such direction received from Holders of the Unsecured Notes (it being understood that the Trustee does not have an affirmative duty to determine whether any action is prejudicial to any Holder). The Unsecured Indenture will provide that the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Unsecured Indenture, and the Issuer is required, within 20 Business Days upon becoming aware of any Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default (unless such Default has been cured or waived within such 20-Business Day time period). The Trustee will not be deemed to have knowledge of any Defaults or Events of Default unless written notice of an event, which is in fact a Default, has been delivered to the Trustee at its office specified in the Indenture and such notice references the Notes and the Indenture and states that it is a “Notice of Default.” Any Default or Event of Default resulting from the failure to deliver a notice, report or certificate under the Unsecured Indenture shall cease to exist and be cured in all respects if the underlying Default or Event of Default 343 ----- giving rise to such notice, report or certificate requirement shall have ceased to exist and/or be cured (including pursuant to this paragraph). For the avoidance of doubt, each of the parties hereto agree that any court of competent jurisdiction may (x) extend or stay any grace period set forth in the Unsecured Indenture prior to when any actual or alleged Default becomes an actual or alleged Event of Default or (y) stay the exercise of remedies by the Trustee or Holders contemplated by the Unsecured Indenture or otherwise upon the occurrence of an actual or alleged Event of Default, in each case of clauses (x) and (y), in accordance with the requirements of applicable law.",N/A,as_expected,2021,482

664,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,239,"BOOK ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM",239.1,Depository Procedures,239.1.1,,"The following description of the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream is provided solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. The Issuer and Trustees take no responsibility for these operations and procedures and urge investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these matters. 403 ----- DTC has advised us that DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities for its participating organizations (collectively, the “Participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions in those securities between the Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its Participants. The Participants include securities brokers and dealers (including the initial purchasers), banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC’s system is also available to other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the “Indirect Participants”). Persons who are not Participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through the Participants or the Indirect Participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership interests in, each security held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the Participants and Indirect Participants. DTC has also advised us that, pursuant to procedures established by it: (1) upon deposit of the Rule 144A Global Notes and the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of Participants designated by the initial purchasers with portions of the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Notes and the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes; and (2) ownership of these interests in Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership of these interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the Participants) or by the Participants and the Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interests in Global Notes). Investors in Rule 144A Global Notes who are Participants in DTC’s system may hold their interests therein directly through DTC. Investors in Rule 144A Global Notes who are not Participants may hold their interests therein indirectly through organizations (including Euroclear and Clearstream) that are Participants in DTC. All interests in a Global Note may be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC. Investors in Regulation S Global Notes must initially hold their interests therein through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are participants in those systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants. After the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period (but not earlier), investors may also hold interests in Regulation S Global Notes through Participants in the DTC system other than Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in Regulation S Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositories, which are Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of Euroclear, and Citibank, NA., as operator of Clearstream, which in turn hold such interests in customers’ securities accounts in the depositaries’ names on the books of DTC. Interests in a Global Note held through Euroclear or Clearstream may be subject to the procedures and requirements of those systems (as well as to the procedures and requirements of DTC). The laws of some states require that certain persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own and the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to persons that are subject to those requirements will be limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of Participants, which in turn act on behalf of Indirect Participants, the ability of a person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge those interests to persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of those interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing those interests. Except as described below, owners of an interest in Global Notes will not have notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of definitive notes in registered certificated form (“Certificated Notes”) and will not be considered the registered owners or “Holders” thereof under the indenture for any purpose. Payments in respect of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on a Global Note registered in the name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the registered Holder under the indentures. 404 ----- Under the terms of each indenture, the Issuer and the applicable Trustee will treat the persons in whose names notes, including Global Notes, are registered as the owners of such notes for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustees or any agent of the Issuer or the Trustees has or will have any responsibility or liability for: (1) any aspect of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in Global Notes; or (2) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its Participants or Indirect Participants. DTC has advised us that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as the notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the payment on the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe it will not receive payment on that payment date. Each relevant Participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by the Participants and the Indirect Participants to the beneficial owners of notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of the Participants or the Indirect Participants and will not be the responsibility of DTC, the Trustees or the Issuer. Neither the Issuer nor the Trustees will be liable for any delay by DTC or any of its Participants in identifying the beneficial owners of any notes, and the Issuer and the Trustees may conclusively rely on and will be protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all purposes. Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth under “Transfer Restrictions,” transfers between Participants in DTC will be effected in accordance with DTC’s procedures, and will be settled in same-day funds and transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures. Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the notes described herein, cross-market transfers between the Participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by their respective depositaries; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its respective depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant Global Note from DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the depositories for Euroclear or Clearstream. DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a Holder of notes only at the direction of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and only in respect of the portion of the aggregate principal amount of the notes as to which that Participant or those Participants has or have given the relevant direction. However, if there is an event of default under the notes, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for legended notes in certificated form, and to distribute those notes to its Participants. Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in Global Notes among Participants, they are under no obligation to perform those procedures, and may discontinue or change those procedures at any time. Neither the Issuer nor the Trustees nor any of their respective agents will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or their respective Participants or Indirect Participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations. 405 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,482

Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such a Covered Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such a Covered Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such a Covered Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the Covered Plan. In considering an investment in the notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a Plan fiduciary should determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to the fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws.",N/A,as_expected,2021,482
664,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,107,CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS,107.2,Prohibited Transaction Issues,107.2.1,,"Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit Covered Plans from engaging in specified transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of Section 3(14) of ERISA, or “disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption is available. A party in interest or disqualified person who engaged in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the Covered Plan that engaged in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and/or the Code. The purchase and/or holding of the notes by a Covered Plan with respect to which the Issuer, a Sponsor, a guarantor, an initial purchaser, the Trustee or any of their respective affiliates (collectively, the “Transaction Parties”) is considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the notes are acquired and held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may apply to the purchase and holding of the notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting life insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers. In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code for certain transactions, provided that neither the issuer of the securities nor any of its affiliates (directly or indirectly) have or exercise any discretionary authority or control or render any investment advice with respect to the assets of any Covered Plan involved in the transaction and provided further that the 416 ----- Covered Plan pays no more than adequate consideration in connection with the transaction. Each of the abovenoted exemptions contains conditions and limitations on its application. Fiduciaries of Covered Plans considering purchasing and/or holding the notes in reliance on these or any other exemption should carefully review the exemption in consultation with its own legal advisors to assure it is applicable. There can be no assurance that any class exemption, statutory exemption or any other exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving the notes, or that if an exemption is available, it will cover all aspects of any particular transaction. Plans that are governmental plans, certain church plans and non-U.S. plans, may not be subject to the fiduciary responsibility or prohibited transaction provisions of Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, but may nevertheless be subject to Similar Laws. Fiduciaries of any such Plans should consult with their legal advisors regarding the potential consequences of an investment in the notes under any applicable Similar Laws before purchasing or holding any notes. Because of the foregoing, the notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing the assets of any Plan, unless such purchase and holding will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA and the Code or a similar violation of any applicable Similar Laws.",N/A,as_expected,2021,482

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries or other persons considering purchasing or holding the notes (or any interest therein) on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their legal advisors regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the notes (and any interest therein). Each purchaser and subsequent transferee has exclusive responsibility for ensuring that its purchase and holding of the notes (and any interest therein) does not violate the fiduciary responsibility or prohibited transaction rules of ERISA or the Code, or the provisions of any applicable Similar Laws. Neither this discussion nor anything provided in this offering memorandum is, or is intended to be, investment advice directed at any potential Plan purchasers, or at Plan purchasers generally, and such purchasers of any notes should consult and rely on their own counsel and advisors as to whether such an investment is suitable for the Plan.

If any of these factors change, the Company may also change its original estimates, which could impact the level of its future allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts receivable are written off when deemed uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts receivable previously written off are recorded when received. Sales Tax: Sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from revenues. Research and Development Expenses: Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs were $45,274, $14,885, and $15,396 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Property, Plant and Equipment: Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are provided over the estimated useful lives, using straight-line and accelerated methods. The cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to income as incurred; significant renewals and betterments are capitalized. Amortization of leasehold improvements is based on the estimated useful life or the term of the lease, whichever is shorter. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: The Company reviews long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when the estimated undiscounted future cash flow from use of the asset is less than the carrying amount of that asset. There was no material impairment recorded during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Goodwill: Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable assets for a business acquisition.

Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. When performing the annual goodwill impairment assessment, the Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If management concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the company conducts a two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test; otherwise, no further analysis is required. Step one of the quantitative goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of each respective reporting unit to which goodwill is assigned to its carrying value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a potential impairment is indicated and step two is performed. Step two compares the carrying value of F-8 ----- MEDLINE INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2020 and 2019 (Dollars in thousands) the reporting unit’s goodwill to its implied fair value. In calculating the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities, including unrecognized intangible assets, of that reporting unit based on their fair values, similar to the allocation that occurs in a business combination. The excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. If the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value, goodwill is not impaired. Intangible Assets: Intangible assets are initially measured at fair value and consist of trade names, customer relationships, non-compete agreements, intellectual property from acquisitions by the Company, and various license and distribution agreements for exclusive supply and distribution rights. These intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.

Revenue Recognition: The Company’s revenues are generated principally from the sale of products. The majority of the sales transactions are supported by an underlying agreement or a formal purchase order. Revenue is F-9 ----- MEDLINE INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2020 and 2019 (Dollars in thousands) recognized as performance obligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied; which generally occurs with the transfer of control. The Company transfers control and recognizes revenue when product is shipped to customers, and customers have legal title to the product, and the Company has a right to payment for such product. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products. Shipping and handling costs are treated as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of sales. Since the Company typically invoices customers when performance obligations are satisfied, the Company does not have material contract assets or contract liabilities. The Company’s credit terms are customary and do not contain significant financing components that extend beyond one year of fulfillment of performance obligations. The Company generally warrants that its products will conform to pre-established specifications and that its products will be free from material defects for a limited time. The Company limits its warranty to the replacement of defective parts, or a refund or credit of the price of the defective product. The Company does not account for these warranties as separate performance obligations. Warranty claims are not material as a majority of the Company’s products are consumables. Although products are generally sold at fixed prices, certain customers receive incentive awards, such as sales rebates, return allowances, scrap allowances, and other rights, which are accounted for as variable consideration. The Company estimates these amounts in the same period revenue is recognized based on the expected value to be provided to the customer and reduces revenue accordingly. The Company’s estimate of variable consideration and ultimate determination of the estimated amounts to include in the transaction price is based primarily on its assessments of anticipated performance and historical information that is reasonably available to the Company. Income Taxes: Medline, with the consent of its stockholders, has elected to be taxed under sections of the U.S. federal and state income tax laws, which provide that, in lieu of corporation income taxes, the stockholders separately account for their pro rata shares of Medline’s items of income, deductions, losses and credits. Income taxes under this election generally relate to certain state income, franchise and minimum taxes where Medline is required to pay taxes at an entity level under state statutes. Certain of the Company’s wholly owned domestic subsidiaries are taxed as a C Corporation under state and federal laws. Certain of the Company’s wholly owned foreign subsidiaries provide for local and deferred income taxes. These domestic and foreign subsidiaries record income tax expense based on the amount of taxes due on their tax return, plus deferred taxes computed based on expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is deemed more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The net deferred income tax asset consists primarily of net operating loss carryforwards in foreign jurisdictions, various valuation allowances, non-deductible accruals and expenses, and the impact of temporary differences related to accrued pension obligations. The components of deferred income taxes, individually and in the aggregate, are not material to the consolidated financial statements. The Company also pays certain foreign branch taxes for subsidiaries located in foreign jurisdictions. A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon examination. For tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test, no tax benefit is recorded. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company did not have any material uncertain tax positions. F-10 ----- MEDLINE INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2020 and 2019 (Dollars in thousands) The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest and income tax expense, respectively. The Company had no amounts accrued for interest or penalties as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. The Company does not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to substantially change in the next 12 months. As of December 31, 2020, the tax years of 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2015 remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions. Defined Benefit Pension Plans: The Company uses appropriate actuarial methods and assumptions in accounting for its defined benefit pension plans. Actual results that differ from assumptions used are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, accordingly, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. Therefore, assumptions used to calculate benefit obligations as of the end of a fiscal year directly impact the expense to be recognized in future periods. The Company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in conformity with sections of Accounting Standards Codification 715. This guidance requires an employer to recognize the funded status of its defined benefit pension plans as a net asset or liability in its statement of financial position, with an offsetting amount in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which changes occur through comprehensive (loss) income. Concentrations of Credit Risk: Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of receivables. The Company extends credit to various customers that are primarily in the health care industry. This specific industry may be similarly affected by economic factors; however, the Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts for specific customers that the Company determines have significant credit risk. Generally, the Company does not require collateral from its customers. Translation of Financial Statements of Foreign Subsidiaries: The Company’s foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency. The consolidated assets and liabilities of the foreign subsidiaries are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Income statement activity with respect to the operations of these subsidiaries is converted at the average rate for the year. The effect of the foreign currency translation is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. Fair Value of Financial Instruments: The Company is required to estimate fair value using a three-tiered hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. Level 1 provides the most reliable measure of fair value; whereas, Level 3 generally requires significant management judgment. The three levels are defined as follows. Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the Company has the ability to access as of the measurement date. Level 2: Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that reflect the Company’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. F-11 ----- MEDLINE INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2020 and 2019 (Dollars in thousands) In many cases, a valuation technique used to measure fair value includes inputs from multiple levels of the fair value hierarchy. The lowest level of significant input determines the placement of the entire fair value measurement in the hierarchy. The carrying amount of financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, notes receivable and accounts payable, approximates fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss: The Company’s accumulated comprehensive loss consists of foreign currency translation and unrecognized net actuarial loss on pension plans. The accumulated comprehensive loss related to foreign currency translation was $(30,812) and $(65,444) at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The accumulated comprehensive gain/(loss) related to pension plans was $(7,590) and $(3,442) at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Reclassification: Certain disclosure in the 2018 and 2019 consolidated financial statements has been reclassified to conform to the 2020 presentation. Change in accounting principle: Under the subsequent measurement accounting alternative allowed in ASU 2014-02 Goodwill and Other (Topic 350), the Company has historically amortized goodwill on a straight-line basis over a useful life of ten years and has tested for goodwill impairment at the entity level. Beginning with the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company has changed its accounting policy from the accounting alternative to the traditional accounting treatment for goodwill. Therefore, goodwill will not be amortized, but rather will be tested for impairment at the reporting unit annually and when evidence of potential impairment exists. As a result, the Company will be able to better benchmark against its public peers. This change in the accounting principle is applied retrospectively in the financial statements. The following table reflects the effect of the change in accounting principle on the December 31, 2020 Consolidated Financial Statements. 2020 As computed As computed under accounting under new alternative accounting policy Effect of change The following tables reflects the impact to the financial statement line items that result from the change in accounting principle on the prior period presented in the accompanying financial statements. 2019 2018 Previously As Previously As reported adjusted Adjustments reported adjusted Adjustments under the new standard will not be provided for dates and periods before January 1, 2022. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on its Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (Topic 350)—Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment (“ASU 2017-04”). ASU 2017-04 simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairments by eliminating the requirement to compare the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount as part of step two of the goodwill impairment test referenced in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (“ASC 350”). As a result, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. However, the impairment loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2021, including any interim impairment tests within those annual periods, with early application permitted. The Company expects to adopt the new standard on January 1, 2021. The Company does not expect material impact on the consolidated financial statements as a result of the adoption. Management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts by identifying at-risk accounts primarily by considering the age of the customer’s receivable and also by considering the credit worthiness of the customer, as well as general economic conditions. If any of these factors change, the Company may also change its original estimates, which could impact the level of its future allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts receivable are written off when deemed uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts receivable previously written off are recorded when received. Sales Tax: Sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from revenues. Property, Plant and Equipment: Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are provided over the estimated useful lives, using straight-line and accelerated methods. The cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to income as incurred; significant renewals and betterments are capitalized. Amortization of leasehold improvements is based on the estimated useful life or the term of the lease, whichever is shorter. Property, plant and equipment, are recorded at cost. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment generally is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful lives of buildings and improvements primarily range from ten to forty years, with the majority in the range of twenty to forty years. The estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment primarily range from three to fifteen years, with the majority in the range of five to ten years. Fully depreciated assets are retained in property, plant and equipment and accumulated depreciation accounts until disposal. Upon disposal, assets and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the net amount, less proceeds from disposal, is charged or credited to operations. Property, plant and equipment amounts are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. The amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis if market value is not readily available or attainable. would be recognized when the estimated undiscounted future cash flow from use of the asset is less than the carrying amount of that asset. There was no material impairment recorded for the half years ended June 26, 2021 and June 27, 2020. Goodwill: Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable assets for a business acquisition. Goodwill amounts as are follows: Total Goodwill December 31, 2020 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $388,754 ConvaTec Measurement Period Adjustment . . . . . . . . . . . 63 Foreign Exchange Adjustment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4 Balance as of June 26, 2021 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $388,821 The Company performs its annual goodwill impairment test in October and monitors for interim indicators of impairment on an ongoing basis. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. When performing the annual goodwill impairment assessment, the Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If management concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the company conducts a quantitative goodwill impairment test; otherwise, no further analysis is required. The quantitative goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. If the estimated fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value, goodwill is not impaired. Intangible Assets: Intangible assets are initially measured at fair value and consist of trade names, customer relationships, non-compete agreements, intellectual property from acquisitions by the Company, and various license and distribution agreements for exclusive supply and distribution rights. These intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. F-30 ----- MEDLINE INDUSTRIES, INC.

Revenue Recognition: The Company’s revenues are generated principally from the sale of products. The majority of the sales transactions are supported by an underlying agreement or a formal purchase order. Revenue is recognized as performance obligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied; which generally occurs with the transfer of control. The Company transfers control and recognizes revenue when product is shipped to customers, and customers have legal title to the product, and the Company has a right to payment for such product. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products. Shipping and handling costs are treated as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of sales. Since the Company typically invoices customers when performance obligations are satisfied, the Company does not have material contract assets or contract liabilities. The Company’s credit terms are customary and do not contain significant financing components that extend beyond one year of fulfillment of performance obligations. F-31 ----- MEDLINE INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As of June 26, 2021 and December 31, 2020 and for the half years ended June 26, 2021 and June 27, 2020 (unaudited) (Dollars in thousands) The Company generally warrants that its products will conform to pre-established specifications and that its products will be free from material defects for a limited time. The Company limits its warranty to the replacement of defective parts, or a refund or credit of the price of the defective product. The Company does not account for these warranties as separate performance obligations. Warranty claims are not material as a majority of the Company’s products are consumables. Although products are generally sold at fixed prices, certain customers receive incentive awards, such as sales rebates, return allowances, scrap allowances, and other rights, which are accounted for as variable consideration. The Company estimates these amounts in the same period revenue is recognized based on the expected value to be provided to the customer and reduces revenue accordingly. The Company’s estimate of variable consideration and ultimate determination of the estimated amounts to include in the transaction price is based primarily on its assessments of anticipated performance and historical information that is reasonably available to the Company. Income Taxes: Medline, with the consent of its stockholders, has elected to be taxed under sections of the U.S. federal and state income tax laws, which provide that, in lieu of corporation income taxes, the stockholders separately account for their pro rata shares of Medline’s items of income, deductions, losses and credits. Income taxes under this election generally relate to certain state income, franchise and minimum taxes where Medline is required to pay taxes at an entity level under state statutes. Certain of the Company’s wholly owned domestic subsidiaries are taxed as a C Corporation under state and federal laws. Certain of the Company’s wholly owned foreign subsidiaries provide for local and deferred income taxes. These domestic and foreign subsidiaries record income tax expense based on the amount of taxes due on their tax return, plus deferred taxes computed based on expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is deemed more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The net deferred income tax asset consists primarily of net operating loss carryforwards in foreign jurisdictions, various valuation allowances, non-deductible accruals and expenses, and the impact of temporary differences related to accrued pension obligations. The components of deferred income taxes, individually and in the aggregate, are not material to the consolidated financial statements. The Company also pays certain foreign branch taxes for subsidiaries located in foreign jurisdictions. A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon examination. For tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test, no tax benefit is recorded. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company did not have any material uncertain tax positions. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest and income tax expense, respectively. The Company had no amounts accrued for interest or penalties as of June 26, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The Company does not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to substantially change in the next 12 months. As of June 26, 2021, the tax years of 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2015 remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions. F-32 ----- MEDLINE INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As of June 26, 2021 and December 31, 2020 and for the half years ended June 26, 2021 and June 27, 2020 (unaudited) (Dollars in thousands) Defined Benefit Pension Plans: The Company uses appropriate actuarial methods and assumptions in accounting for its defined benefit pension plans. Actual results that differ from assumptions used are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, accordingly, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. Therefore, assumptions used to calculate benefit obligations as of the end of a fiscal year directly impact the expense to be recognized in future periods. The Company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in conformity with sections of ASC 715. This guidance requires an employer to recognize the funded status of its defined benefit pension plans as a net asset or liability in its statement of financial position, with an offsetting amount in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which changes occur through comprehensive (loss) income. Concentrations of Credit Risk: Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of receivables. The Company extends credit to various customers that are primarily in the health care industry. This specific industry may be similarly affected by economic factors; however, the Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts for specific customers that the Company determines have significant credit risk. Generally, the Company does not require collateral from its customers. Translation of Financial Statements of Foreign Subsidiaries: The Company’s foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency. The consolidated assets and liabilities of the foreign subsidiaries are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Income statement activity with respect to the operations of these subsidiaries is converted at the average rate for the year. The effect of the foreign currency translation is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. Fair Value of Financial Instruments: The Company is required to estimate fair value using a three-tiered hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. Level 1 provides the most reliable measure of fair value; whereas, Level 3 generally requires significant management judgment. The three levels are defined as follows. Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the Company has the ability to access as of the measurement date. Level 2: Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that reflect the Company’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. In many cases, a valuation technique used to measure fair value includes inputs from multiple levels of the fair value hierarchy. The lowest level of significant input determines the placement of the entire fair value measurement in the hierarchy. F-33 ----- MEDLINE INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As of June 26, 2021 and December 31, 2020 and for the half years ended June 26, 2021 and June 27, 2020 (unaudited) (Dollars in thousands) The carrying amount of financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, notes receivable and accounts payable, approximates fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss: The Company’s accumulated comprehensive loss consists of foreign currency translation and unrecognized net actuarial loss on pension plans. The accumulated comprehensive loss related to foreign currency translation was $(43,359) and $(30,812) as of June 26, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The accumulated comprehensive (loss) related to pension plans was $(7,590) and $(7,590) as of June 26, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Recently Issued Accounting Standards: In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) established Topic 842, Leases, by issuing Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02, which requires lessees to recognize leases on-balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. Topic 842 was subsequently amended by No. 2018-01, Leases (Topic 842): Land Easement Practical Expedient for _Transition to Topic 842, No. 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases, No. 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements, No. 2018-20, Leases (Topic 842): Narrow-Scope Improvements for Lessors, and No. 2019-01, Leases (Topic 842): Codification Improvements, and No. 2019-10, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842): Effective Dates. The new standard establishes a right-of-use (“ROU”) model that requires a lessee to recognize a ROU_ asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with a term longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern and classification of expense recognition in the income statement. On June 3, 2020 FASB released a media advisory that indicated that private companies that have not yet applied the new standards will receive an effective date deferral. Private companies can apply the new lease standard for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and to interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The new standard is effective for the Company on January 1, 2022, with early adoption permitted. A modified retrospective transition approach is required, applying the new standard to all leases existing at the date of initial application. An entity may choose to use either (1) its effective date or (2) the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the consolidated financial statements as its date of initial application. If an entity chooses the second option, the transition requirements for existing leases also apply to leases entered into between the date of initial application and the effective date. The entity must also recast its comparative period consolidated financial statements and provide the disclosures required by the new standard for the comparative periods. The Company expects to adopt the new standard on January 1, 2022 and use the effective date as the date of initial application. Consequently, financial information will not be updated and the disclosures required under the new standard will not be provided for dates and periods before January 1, 2022. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on the consolidated financial statements. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards: In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) - Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment (“ASU 2017-04”). ASU 2017-04 simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairments by eliminating the requirement to compare the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount as part of step two of the goodwill impairment test referenced in ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (“ASC 350”). As a result, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount.

664,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1030,NOTE 1 - NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES,1030.22,,1030.22.1,,"Nature of Business: Medline Industries, Inc. (“Medline”) and subsidiaries (together, the “Company”) is a manufacturer and distributor of medical supplies. Its customers are primarily composed of hospitals, nursing homes and other health care providers located in the United States of America, Canada, Europe, Asia-Pacific (which includes Southeast Asia, Japan and Australia), Latin America (which includes Mexico), and the Middle East. Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Medline and its wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates: The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates include, but are not limited to, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation reserves, fair value of investments in trading securities, impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill, deferred tax valuations, depreciation, actuarial assumptions and fair value allocations related to business combinations. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company considered the impact of COVID-19 on the assumptions and estimates used and determined that there were no material adverse impacts on the Company’s results of operations and financial position. Cash and Cash Equivalents: The Company considers all highly liquid financial instruments with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. Due to the short-term nature of these instruments, the carrying values approximate the fair market value.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2020 and 2019 (Dollars in thousands) Nature of Business: Medline Industries, Inc. (“Medline”) and subsidiaries (together, the “Company”) is a manufacturer and distributor of medical supplies. Its customers are primarily composed of hospitals, nursing homes and other health care providers located in the United States of America, Canada, Europe, Asia-Pacific (which includes Southeast Asia, Japan and Australia), Latin America (which includes Mexico), and the Middle East. Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Medline and its wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates: The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates include, but are not limited to, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation reserves, fair value of investments in trading securities, impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill, deferred tax valuations, depreciation, actuarial assumptions and fair value allocations related to business combinations. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company considered the impact of COVID-19 on the assumptions and estimates used and determined that there were no material adverse impacts on the Company’s results of operations and financial position. Cash and Cash Equivalents: The Company considers all highly liquid financial instruments with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. Due to the short-term nature of these instruments, the carrying values approximate the fair market value. Of the cash held on deposit, essentially all of the cash balances were in excess of amounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or other foreign provided bank insurance. The Company performs periodic evaluations of these institutions for relative credit standing and has not experienced any losses as a result of its cash concentration.

Debt Securities: These securities consist primarily of corporate and municipal bonds, fixed interest debt obligations, and auction-rate municipal bonds. Corporate and municipal bonds, and fixed interest debt obligations, are valued through consultation and evaluation, with brokers in the institutional market, using quoted prices and other observable market data. As such, a portion of these securities are included in both Level 1 and Level 2. Derivative Investments: Cotton and oil hedges are valued based on their subcomponents, typically a variety of options linked to the price of the S&P GSCI Cotton Excess Return and the S&P GSCI Crude Oil Index Excess Return, respectively. Option pricing is calculated using the Black-Scholes model (or a Monte Carlo simulation based on the same theory). The price is evaluated based on a variety of inputs, including expected payout in various states, expiration of assets, the historical, current and expected future values of the underlying assets, and market volatility. As such, derivative investments are included in Level 3. Participation Units: The company invests in a fund that is invested in structured products within the United States.

Debt Securities: These securities consist primarily of corporate bonds. Corporate bonds are valued through consultation and evaluation, with brokers in the institutional market, using quoted prices. As such, these securities are included in Level 1. Derivative Investments: Cotton and oil hedges are valued based on their subcomponents, typically a variety of options linked to the price of the S&P GSCI Cotton Excess Return and the S&P GSCI Crude Oil Index Excess Return, respectively. Option pricing is calculated using the Black-Scholes model (or a Monte Carlo simulation based on the same theory). The price is evaluated based on a variety of inputs, including expected payout in various states, expiration of assets, the historical, current and expected future values of the underlying assets, and market volatility. As such, derivative investments are included in Level 3. F-41 ----- MEDLINE INDUSTRIES, INC.
